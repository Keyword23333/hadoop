4610001 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4610002 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4610003 but now we are some of the best bigfoot hunters in the world
4610004 theres also an igor and a dmitri coming from russia
4610005 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4610006 i was shocked youve got a really soulful voice we havent heard the best of you yet and im really excited to see what could come
4610007 i like your passion determination this competition needs someone like you
4610008 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4610009 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4610010 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4610011 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4610012 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4610013 were going to move the desk forward so were very very close to cheryl when she performs that night

4610015 its weird for me and im sure itll be weird for her
4610016 6 years later shes in the biggest girl band in the country and im playing working mens clubs i fit in between the bingo
4610017 i honestly dont think you have a great voice youre a nice guy but you wont win this competition
4610018 your voice isnt strong enough to get through the competition and you look too old to fit into a boyband i would struggle to place you
4610019 o k i can make this straight forward the competitions have gone up and you havent got it and its time to stop chasing this dream and do something youll be happy in and not frustrated its gone on long enough now and i can tell you by that audition you havent got it in your voice and i dont think you ever will
4610020 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4610021 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4610022 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4610023 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4610024 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
4610025 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
4610026 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4610027 je te le dis devant la france et la belgique enti res toi et moi cest fini jai pr venu ta famille ta m re tes amis personne te reconna t tas plus personne

4610029 in almost all of the announced settlements institutional investors and retail clients with significant holdings may have to wait significantly longer for such repurchases if at all
4610030 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4610031 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4610032 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4610033 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4610034 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4610035 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4610036 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4610037 kiss me like im yours to hold and ill give you everything it may include it may not be limited to forever you and me
4610038 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4610039 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4610040 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4610041 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4610042 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4610043 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4610044 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4610045 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4610046 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4610047 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4610048 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4610049 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4610050 his voice sounded very strong and his laughter his spirit was great
4610051 the united states and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government
4610052 georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected moscow must live up to its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4610053 what you have here is a power that is on the march that thinks it can intimidate anybody in the way
4610054 what the next administration does is up to them but at least you have things in place that leave them with a foundation from which to move forward
4610055 national security policy does not suddenly make a u turn on election day
4610056 damaged its credibility and relations with the nations of the free world
4610057 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4610058 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4610059 right now our focus is on the immediate issue of the russian troops withdrawing that there be a cessation of violence
4610060 and that is where our focus will remain in this immediate time period

4610062 the rocker opening wednesday nationwide wilson 42 is all boyish charm with a sweet open face that bears no resemblance to the usually scowling dwight
4610063 i take full responsibility for that haircut its the least flattering it can be kind of inverted bangs which exposes my high forehead
4610064 because we have this great fertile situation in the office the writers on the show are very interested in exploring the subtleties and complexities of the characters not just writing the same stuff over and over again and people are very collaborative so i get the benefit of having great scripts and having some input by throwing ideas around another good aspect is i get to improvise
4610065 i realized after about seven or eight years that i was most successful in comic roles playing oddballs and misfits but dont ask me to tell a joke im terrible with jokes
4610066 and when i learned one of the directors being considered was peter cattaneo who made the full monty the last word in funny male nudity i really pushed hard for him to get the job because i knew we would get something memorable
4610067 a down and out ninja living in the san fernando valley
4610068 cuando nos critiquen hay que tener coherencia en las cr ticas
4610069 yo veo al ministro de comercio supongo que est equivocada la noticia pero parece con comillas diciendo que despu s de la subida de la tasa de inter s pasada hubo una apreciaci n muy fuerte del peso si se va hablar de la tasa de cambio d lar hay que hacerle un seguimiento a la tasa de cambio porque despu s de la medida pasada hay una devaluaci n de cerca de 6 puntos porcentuales entonces a la gente no se le puede decir lo que no es si se va a hablar de tasa de cambio hay que entender que es una tasa de cambio entender que es un comportamiento de la tasa de cambio y reflejar la realidad que es una devaluaci n del 6 por ciento posterior a la decisi n de la junta directiva
4610070 esa mayor tasa de inter s iba a generar una apreciaci n del peso
4610071 comenz efectivamente la tasa de cambio cerca de 30 por debajo a como hab a cerrado el viernes pero termin cerca de 10 por encima
4610072 eso confirma lo que hemos dicho siempre el diferencial de tasas de inter s es un elemento que puede afectar el comportamiento de la tasa de cambio pero no es el nico pero no el fundamental
4610073 aplaudo que el ministro santos se interese por la seguridad

4610075 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
4610076 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
4610077 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show
4610078 it was wonderful i am very pumped up it was very smooth in the bay and it was a great feeling to be skimming across the water
4610079 i get more out of it than they do it couldnt be more rewarding
4610080 it was just so warm and so comforting it was like we knew mike forever
4610081 experiences like that keep chris so motivated to keep going
4610082 es dif cil jugar cuando en el equipo hay una mala relaci n con personas que nos est n dirigiendo si el conductor de un veh culo est despistado ser dif cil que pueda llegar a su destino sin ning n percance
4610083 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
4610084 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
4610085 it was way out of reason the suspect in this case thought his information was worth a whole lot more it was more than you could by a steak with
4610086 based on what mr hudson and sheriff brown said it appears they nipped this so this information didnt get out
4610087 out of that 6 000 pages i am sure there is going to be information that isnt going to be admissable for whatever reason i think it is pretty fortunate on behalf of my client that they were able to stop this
4610088 not to to remove posts without a good faith belief that the post being flagged violates these tou
4610089 lately ive been really interested in fashion and i like to make binders and slideshows of high fashion modeling and designs
4610090 i just kind of wanted to document my outfits and it was just a random thing that wasnt in relation to anything
4610091 parents have no idea what their kids are doing online
4610092 i share a lot of information to people i guess more than i probably should but i just felt i didnt want the people who are very close to me reading it because i guess im embarrassed about my writing sometimes
4610093 i may have known but to me it was a kind of a non thing to know
4610094 i didnt look at it i wasnt terribly interested in seeing it
4610095 anyone who actually believes she is 12 is an absolute idoit sic
4610096 she slept in the bed with us that night to get back to sleep
4610097 she woke up and again woke us up and said and this is really heartbreaking i just woke up crying and i dont even know why im crying
4610098 whoever may comment and whatever feedback you may get girls are very impressionable especially girls in this age that were talking about
4610099 oh theres some celebrity down there look at the crowd
4610100 watching from afar with lebron he handles the ball a lot
4610101 i think that i can take a load off of him handling the ball at times hes a guy that kind of sets his teammates up a lot i think i can relieve him from that that will help him as far as being a little fresher at the end of the season
4610102 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4610103 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4610104 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4610105 we want to talk to tom biscardi they didnt want to meet anyone else
4610106 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4610107 this body has little to do with bigfoot and everything to do with a sasquatch costume that someone developed after watching too many gorilla movies
4610108 the teeth that seem to have been placed in the mouth could be my late mothers false teeth
4610109 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4610110 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4610111 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4610112 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4610113 a flesh eating bacteria and sexual abnormality which says that gay men carry deadly diseases and that muslim men should not shake their hands as one never knows what kind of bacteria and germs are found on them
4610114 almost every piece of electronics does have lead in it theres lead imprinted circuit boards a computer monitor or television could contain up to seven pounds of lead and thats something we dont want to see in the landfills so were giving people the opportunity to recycle things properly
4610115 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
4610116 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
4610117 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4610118 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4610119 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4610120 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4610121 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4610122 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4610123 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4610124 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4610125 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4610126 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4610127 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4610128 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4610129 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4610130 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4610131 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4610132 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4610133 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4610134 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4610135 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4610136 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4610137 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4610138 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4610139 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4610140 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4610141 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4610142 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4610143 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4610144 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4610145 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4610146 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4610147 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4610148 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4610149 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4610150 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4610151 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4610152 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4610154 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4610155 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4610156 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4610157 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4610158 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4610159 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4610160 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4610161 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4610162 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4610163 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4610164 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4610165 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4610166 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4610167 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4610168 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4610169 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4610172 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4610173 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4610174 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4610199 not worth it to fly across country for a thirty minute visit talking through a pane of glass thats all id be allowed
4610200 shes finally taken up drawing again its all she has left
4610201 my wife and i went to the bahamas for our honeymoon
4610202 i use this with your pre party product i have noticed such a difference the next day what a pleasure not to feel like youve been hit by a bus
4610203 i lived in this community back in the late 80s
4610204 there was a need in the community this wall has been empty for over 20 years
4610205 the reason why i painted this painting is for our future
4610206 i wanted for our children and the future generations to have this to look back on history
4610207 even though in modern times we go through changes these ways are with us they will always be with us they always have been with us
4610208 i feel honored to be able to honor them the people who have lost their lives
4610209 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4610210 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4610211 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4610212 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4610213 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4610214 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4610215 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4610216 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4610217 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4610218 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4610219 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4610220 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4610221 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4610222 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4610223 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4610224 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4610225 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4610226 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4610227 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4610228 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4610229 i am sure this would be par for the course in a jewish or m
4610230 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4610231 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4610232 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4610233 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4610234 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4610235 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4610236 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4610237 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4610238 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4610239 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4610240 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4610241 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4610242 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4610243 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4610244 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4610245 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4610246 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4610247 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4610248 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4610249 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4610250 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4610251 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4610252 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4610253 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4610254 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4610255 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4610256 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4610257 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4610258 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4610259 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4610260 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4610261 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4610262 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4610263 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4610264 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4610265 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4610266 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4610267 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4610268 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4610269 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4610270 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4610271 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4610272 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4610273 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4610274 ive always played shortstop and third base my whole life but this year i decided to concentrate on pitching
4610275 its tough sitting on the bench you want to get out there and play but its tough on the arm playing shortstop and making all the throws to first and pitching
4610276 i batted third for team ontario the last couple years
4610277 a very polished right handed pitcher billy has a chance to make an immediate impact in our baseball program as a freshman
4610278 he brings a wealth of experience to binghamton having pitched against a very high level of competition in canada billys an extremely bright young man who exemplifies the type of student athlete we are looking for in our program
4610279 im looking forward to the chance to play high level baseball
4610280 it will be a good test to compete against the top guys in the country and improve under a good coach get bigger and stronger and get the velocity up there to where pro scouts will start looking
4610281 location has always been a key for me my velocity is coming along its as high as 88 mph but ive always been taught location is the biggest thing and the ability to change speeds
4610282 i am not responsible for the candidates committee but i cannot imagine that groenlinks has no place for people that give such an account of their past
4610283 your call to terrorise me was successful an arson attempt on my home was made by shoving rags drenched in petrol and set on fire through my front door luckily we had a tile floor
4610284 he knew his dossiers extremely well and was regularly able to give ministers a hard time but with some regularity stories appeared about his role within the squatters movement in which the name of terrorist group rara often surfaced to his frustration
4610285 because for him it was actually a matter of rendering an account with his past his progressive insight that politics is the best way to change things
4610286 the wijnand of that time was a completely different person from the wijnand of today
4610287 the actions he carried out in the 1980s as environmental activist are no reason in themselves for him to resign
4610288 i myself like many other groenlinksers was involved in the squatting movement in the 1980s squatting is breaking in but does that mean everything that is outside the law is also unacceptable i do not think so
4610289 i cannot imagine that groenlinks has no place for people that give such an account of their past
4610290 we have no intentions of revealing the location we want to protect this creature
4610291 it definitely looks like our costume this body has little to do with bigfoot and everything to do with a sasquatch costume that someone developed
4610292 we want to know if there is sufficient customer demand for us to continue to offer this to the community
4610293 that s because more individuals have been involved in single cases
4610294 it s particularly surprising when you consider that almost half the u s military population is 25 years old or younger
4610295 we believe this is a reflection of our continued efforts to educate our airmen about the need to conduct themselves as ambassadors and good neighbors in japan
4610296 from our newcomer s briefings to commander s calls to our day to day emphasis on proper conduct the message is being heard and understood that there is no tolerance for behavior that jeopardizes relations with our host nation
4610297 while the number of overall crimes is continuing to decrease there is still more work to be done and we will continue our prevention and education efforts
4610298 indicative of the increased command influence resulting from the period of reflection
4610299 some of the units have instituted a buddy system that is mandatory
4610300 the number of crimes committed by u s marines and their dependents continues to remain proportionately low compared to the overall crime rate on the island
4610301 status of forces agreement personnel make up about 4 percent of the population on okinawa but are historically involved in about 1 percent of crimes
4610302 by far the vast majority of marines respect and abide by both the uniform code of military justice and civilian local laws
4610303 those marines who break the law are few and far between and they are dealt with in an appropriate manner by the marine corps chain of command
4610304 in fact we re going to pick up the force level a bit
4610305 there is no doubt if the north koreans decide to cause trouble what the outcome will be no doubt at all
4610306 changes are about to come to the united states and japan
4610307 japanese and u s governments with their determination to keep military bases on okinawa have created a cunning structure so that people have no choice but to accept military presence in exchange for economic interest
4610308 there is no space affordable on okinawa that can be sacrificed merely because of less human habitation
4610309 it s the most important thing in korean food but they do not really know how to do it
4610310 the cultural interaction to me is very special it creates a bond and it makes everybody more comfortable
4610311 remember i said usain no asafa no ill bet money on usain bolt is faster because hes more accurate than asafa no asafa will win the gold hell get the gold medal
4610312 theres no others to me apart from asafa and usain thats my choice the others are just competing they are just running because they have to when they are up against usain and asafa they just arent competing its a run
4610313 the 100m final is going to cause a run on the power companies i think this will be the highest audience in jamaican tv history
4610314 i did a presentation to seb coe when he visited here about a month or two ago in the middle of it he stopped me and said if utech was a country youd rank in the top five in the world
4610315 the chairman of the organising committee at the 2012 olympics in london said that and im telling you we expect to get eight medals from beijing it may be optimistic but we have to wait and see
4610316 we learnt a lot from the americans nearly everything apart from the drugs
4610317 any of them could win but as a jamaican i would like asafa or bolt win but you cant discount the fact that gay has a great chance also
4610318 he has the fastest time in the world not recorded as it was wind assisted of 9 68 seconds so hes up there most people are blinded by the facts because they are jamaican
4610319 look at the usa they have better facilities than us but us jamaicans we train naturally with push ups and we come out further thats a great thing
4610320 were a likkle dot against the world how can you not feel proud of jamaica
4610321 i would like bolt to win the 200 and asafa the 100 bearing in mind usain is the 200 man and asafa the 100 and all carry the gold back to jamaica
4610322 we wanted to treat san diego like a liberty port
4610323 we have been looking at this for a year now and have done a full court press to get our crew ready to hit these liberty expectations
4610324 we haven t seen any problems with it we ve been in san diego for a long time and everyone is concentrating on working to get out of here
4610325 to serve as the centerpiece of the forward deployed naval force
4610326 as guests in a foreign country we must respect host nation traditions laws and standards of acceptable behavior
4610327 what we do in our host nations is a reflection of our sailors and their families the u s navy and the united states
4610328 my advice is to come here with a guest mentality
4610329 if you respect the rules and are courteous you won t have any problem
4610330 that was the worst bit of crowd surfing ive ever seen they left you
4610331 i thought im going out on a high now this is my moment but the people slowly parted to a concrete floor
4610332 i was scared of being booed ive been scared ever since i went into the house i dont wanna get my little violin out but i dont know many people where im from people just think im arrogant i thought people would be going boo and throwing eggs at me
4610333 eight weeks away from my daughter was literally hell on earth
4610334 i wanted to finish it off i wanted to see if the crowd booed me i dont need to be loved by the nation i knew i was never gonna win or get to the final
4610335 i dont think she fancies me thats just kat doing her cookie love thing
4610336 i dont know where that came from just before she went she said she fancied dale i couldnt see it
4610337 he is greedy mo nothings ever shared everyones hungry but you just never go for that last portion hes the only person in the house who the whole way through irritated me
4610338 they cant escape each other i feel sorry for both of them ive seen them argue any little thing is turned massive they were arguing just now
4610339 mikey should win hes the only one in there who doesnt act
4610340 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4610341 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4610342 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4610343 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4610344 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4610345 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4610346 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4610347 par pricing which basically tells them that you know the game and will not tolerate back end fees
4610348 good faith estimate the cost breakdown of your loan which all brokers must send to you within 3 days of the application this is a federal law they have to indicate in small print mind you the amount of yield spread premium if any is charged make sure it states 0

4610455 he has the fastest time in the world not recorded as it was wind assisted of 9 68 seconds so hes up there most people are blinded by the facts because they are jamaican

4610466 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
4610467 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
4610468 it was way out of reason the suspect in this case thought his information was worth a whole lot more it was more than you could by a steak with
4610469 based on what mr hudson and sheriff brown said it appears they nipped this so this information didnt get out
4610470 out of that 6 000 pages i am sure there is going to be information that isnt going to be admissable for whatever reason i think it is pretty fortunate on behalf of my client that they were able to stop this

4610500 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4610501 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4610502 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4610503 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is

4610512 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4610513 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4610514 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4610515 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4610516 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had

4610519 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4610520 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labour agreement

4610532 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4610537 i like to say now that i chose to work for john lewis over m amp s because of the different operating model and the quality of the people who work in the business but the real truth was because we owned two golf courses and five ocean going yachts
4610538 they are a pain in the arse to deal with at the corporate level
4610539 it is irritating does it make sense not to me if we were working with a different retailer would we have that problem probably not but it is because of the partnership structure

4610547 going from 15 5 to 16 1 in hemoglobin is not that unusual when not competing
4610548 but it is very unusual to see an increase after a hard week of cycling youd expect it to be the reverse youd expect that to fall in a clean athlete
4610549 theres nothing where i could point to one value and say this guy definitely doped but it raises red flags for me i would definitely recommend to anti doping authorities that an athlete presenting these values should be target tested for blood doping

4610555 absentee voting can be done by mail there are also some alternatives that weve been working with the states for electronic alternatives for our voters
4610556 so many states have passed legislation that allows a voter to submit voting materials by fax or e mail
4610557 we want to give the citizens as many opportunities as many alternatives as possible that are allowed by their state law to communicate with that local election office
4610558 we want everyone to participate in the voting process our servicemembers their family members and all of our overseas citizens
4610559 it is voting outreach to let them know that they are eligible to participate in this democratic process

4610594 fluoridation is the greatest case of scientific fraud of this century
4610595 the drug program was part of a much larger cia program to study possible means of controlling human behavior
4610596 lawsuits from workers and communities poisoned by industrial fluoride emissions
4610597 you can get practically any idea accepted if doctors are in favour
4610598 the august 1948 journal of the american dental association shows that evidence of adverse effects from fluoride was censored by the us atomic energy commission for reasons of
4610599 fluoride that is added to municipal water is a hazardous waste product for which there is substantial evidence of adverse health effects and contrary to public perception virtually no evidence of significant benefits

4610718 the primate of the southern cone bishop gregory venables predicted the end of the communion saying
4610719 the point that interests me is why he continues and whether what we see is peculiarly religious behaviour its just possible that it is not what the archbishop is holding on to is the idea that we cant have ideas alone they are always part of a conversation within a particular community and sometimes the things that we get from that community are more important than any particular idea in his case as a christian who believes that the church in some sense is a means for gods purpose in the world he has to think that connection with it is a vital part of what he is called to do
4610720 in summary here are some of the things that did and did not happen 1 bishop of new hampshire gene robinson did not gain official entrance to lambeth but he was frequently on site at the university of kent to the joy of some and the disgust of others 2 lambeths 600 plus bishops no official count or list has been released did not approve an anglican convenant much discussion was held and more meetings on the covenant are expected lasting into 2009 3 the anglican communion did avoid a formal split or schism yet even rowan williams admits the communion is still at gravel peril 4 lambeth attending conservative bishops and primates did voice much criticism of liberals and revisionist theology but as yet the rhetoric of conservatives has not resulted in all revisionists clearly agreeing to bans on same sex unions and gay ordinations the word stalemate still seems to fit this situation

4610749 mr fincher and his colleague randy thornhill wondered if disease might be driving important aspects of human social behaviour too their hypothesis is that in places where disease is rampant it behoves groups not to mix with one another more than is strictly necessary in order to reduce the risk of contagion they therefore predict that patterns of behaviour which promote group exclusivity will be stronger in disease ridden areas since religious differences are certainly in that category they specifically predict that the number of different religions in a place will vary with the disease load
4610750 i grew up in penn hills where our parish festival ran for six nights it started sunday afternoon with a spaghetti dinner and ended friday night with fireworks in between there was gambling skydivers bingo hayrides raffles and plenty of junk food hot dogs hot sausage sandwiches fries sno cones that first night of the festival walking to the church grounds was such a giddy kid time when you arrived the atmosphere was overwhelming to every sense the colored lights the smell of popcorn the sound of the merry go round

4610752 it seems to me that the maturing of the global nature of the anglican communion beyond its colonial beginnings would involve separating the role of the spiritual leader of the communion from that of the primate of all england the primate of all england should still retain the title primus inter pares for he does retain a significant place of honour and historical significance i would not want to diminish that in any way we are very grateful for the british missionaries who came to us in uganda and brought to us the word of god and the gospel of jesus christ we shall never forget that and never cease giving thanks

4610762 here then is perhaps one road forward for the conservatives gafcon and the global south should call an immediate moratorium on border crossing yes that will be painful for many it will explicitly involve the dying to self that i spoke about above for in the short term it will leave many abused and attacked in liberal dioceses believing that they have been abandoned by those who said they would provide rescue it would also implicitly involve confessing that the act of crossing diocesan boundaries was wrong for we there would be no need to have a moratorium if crossing boundaries was seen by all as acceptable but beyond these two things it would at the same time indicate that we are serious about holding the communion together and what it would also do is give tec canada and scotland now it appears a very clear opportunity to also engage in the moratoria that they have been asked to impose on same sex blessings and ordaining and consecrating those in sexual relationships outside of marriage

4610779 they did talk about sexuality they did talk about the threat of schism and the means of heading it off the two and a half weeks in canterbury were not an avoid ance exercise for it was known beforehand that the conference by itself had no authority to resolve the crisis over homosexuality even had the gafcon bishops been present for this reason the archbishop of canterbury and his team devised a programme that emphasised conversation rather than resolution we have no quibble with the lambeth conference conceived as a means of enlarging bishops vision and enabling them to serve their dioceses better we should not mind even if in 2018 the archbishop it might be dr williams he would be only 68 clears the programme completely of meetings and turns the whole thing into a bishops holiday just so long as the conference has no executive function the anglican communion is an episcopal body but not exclusively much has been said of anglican gifts in recent days one is the strong sense of the equality of all lay and ordained members of the body of christ the expression of this in a form of synodical government that includes representation of the laity as well as the clergy came later to the church of england than to other provinces none the less the place of the clergy and laity in the governance of the church is now a key mark of anglicanism

4610874 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4610875 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4610876 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4610877 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

4610894 its a great place to raise your family its safe its fun its affordable and its growing
4610895 what parents need to look for are communities that have the resources to promote physical social and cognitive development
4610896 this includes a strong school system that provides after school programs
4610897 if you come home and the kids are already in bed that detracts from family life both psychologically and economically especially considering todays gas prices
4610898 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is

4610917 i have to come and check on him to make sure hes ok
4610918 you will actually see a bipedal creature and a photograph with the teeth up close to prove to you people that this is not a mask
4610919 i got to tell you it was a euphoric experience for me
4610920 i didnt believe in bigfoot at the time ive seen the films and the things on television and you have to come to terms with it and realize that youve got something special
4610921 its like finding the biggest diamond in the world and having it in your possession
4610922 discovery its a hoax its a halloween costume in a box
4610923 theres a whole number of things that raise red flags in my opinion
4610924 we started to tell people the week after we found the body but no one believed us
4610925 so we started to make fun of the bigfoot trackers and that got attention
4610926 you type in bigfoot and thats the name that comes up
4610927 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4610928 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4610929 was no intent to mislead in the filing of the return
4610930 we accept the outcome of the police investigation we thought it deserved investigation because of various discrepancies and the police did find undeclared spending
4610931 the complaint has been investigated fully and as a result i can advise that no offence has been committed by councillor cox there were some mistakes in the filing of councillor coxs return however following investigation i am satisfied that these mistakes were genuine and there was no intent to mislead in the filing of the return

4610936 till this day i hear it it breaks my heart my kids had to see this and deal with this because drunk driver had to go to home depot for what
4610937 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4610938 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4610939 the key is whether the legislature has the right to inform the public of sex offenders living in the community
4610940 the intent of the legislature was not to provide punishment but to provide a civil remedial action
4610941 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4610942 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4610943 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4610944 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4610945 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4610946 based on the unanimous passage of this legislation through both chambers of the nevada legislature it would be hard to assume anyone foresaw the constitutional challenges the law is currently facing
4610947 still governor gibbons would much rather sign aggressive laws protecting the people of nevada from sexual predators than wait to see how other states handle federal legislation and see whether the courts agree with it
4610948 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4610949 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4610950 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4610951 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4610952 i have done everything i can to comply with the law and be a good citizen
4610953 i would never hurt anyone but none of that matters now
4610954 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4610955 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4610956 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4610957 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4610958 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4610959 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4610960 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4610963 these two cases in texas are just the tip of the iceberg
4610964 across texas and around the country people are convicted of arson based on junk science that has been completely discredited for years

4610966 each and every one of the indicators listed by mr vasquez means absolutely nothing and in fact is expected in a context of a fire that has achieved full room involvement as this fire clearly did
4610967 low burning charred flooring burning underneath items of furniture are common characteristics of a fully involved fire they mean nothing with respect to the origin and cause of the fire
4610968 i talked to the occupant of this house and i let him talk and he told me a story of pure fabrication
4610969 tells the story i am just the interpreter i am looking at the fire and i am interpreting the fire that is what i know that is what i do best and the fire does not lie it tells me the truth
4610970 do i really need it do i have something like this at home
4610971 yes in this moment i think this might make me happy
4610972 there are more important things in life than buying stuff

4610977 der dritte grundpfeiler einer spirituellen beziehung ist die stille sie teilen und respektieren gemeinsam die stille die stille kann der private kreis sein kann das ruhen nach einer schaffensperiode sein die stille ist die rekreation in der partnerschaft damit ist nicht das schweigen gemeint das ich habe nichts zu sagen damit ist die ruhe und die verbindung zur unendlichkeit und zur ewigkeit gemeint die wir sterbliche wesen mit einer art nabelschnur mit uns herumtragen in einer partnerschaft wissen wir um die stille und ihre bedeutung und sie hat ihren platz
4610978 in manchen beziehungen wird die stille nicht ertragen das freie schweben in zeit und raum wird als angriff auf das leben in der beziehung verstanden bem hte aktivit t zwanghaftes leeres ritual kann die folge sein die stille kommt die stille geht und die beziehung bleibt wer diese grundpfeiler einer beziehung achtet der wird auch besser verstehen was in zwangsehen und in freiwilligen ehen geschieht
4610979 im westen ist das momentane ideal das menschen aus freiem willen eine beziehung mit einander eingehen und auch mir liegt dieses ideal sehr nahe
4610980 ist einem paar das von den eltern zusammengebracht wurde hnliches m glich k nnen sich die zwei ohne sich ein bild von dem anderen zu machen kennen lernen k nnen sie gemeinsam kinder haben wollen hat die stille bei ihnen ein platz die chance besteht auch hier aus der diktatorischen situation in eine liebevolle freie beziehung zu m nden wenn beide den weg dahin finden wollen
4610981 stelle dir mal vor du bist mitglied einer kleinen menschengruppe von dreizehn menschen mehr menschen kennst du nicht und du wirst vielleicht jahrelang nicht mehr menschen kennen lernen du brauchst die anderen zw lf zum berleben hass ist ein luxus der dein leben mit den zw lfen in eine h lle verwandeln wird liebe ist die f higkeit das leben mit den zw lfen in ein paradies zu verwandeln
4610982 sag dir einfach he ihr zw lf wo immer ihr seid und wann immer ihr mich h rt ihr braucht mich und ich brauche euch ein weg der liebe f hrt uns zusammen an die pforte des gl cks der hass k nnte unser untergang sein

4611003 catholics are the last swing voters left in the country
4611004 maybe were a little bit more open to female leadership

4611007 the nuns were the people we saw every day and they were running the whole show
4611008 i voted for obama but it was mostly an anti hillary vote
4611009 i mean obamas got some good things about him but the experience is a question so i might end up with mccain

4611044 lyricist john blackburn told me that he and his collaborator karl suessdorf picked the title because they thought a state song if it is a hit will last as long as the state
4611045 john blackburn recalls the process of creativity in 1944 after completing the first 12 bars of the lyric i realized there was no rhyme and then said to karl lets follow the pattern of no rhyme throughout the song obviously the approach was right the song is a standard read the lyric aloud and try to identify the alternative chiming devices that lyricist blackburn used in place of end rhyme the fullest verbal echo is the songs title itself placed strongly in the final line of all three a sections
4611046 when whiting got to the line ski tows down a mountainside whiting panicked saying she had no idea what a ski tow looked like mercer got on the phone and called the two songwriters and asked them if he could change the line to ski trails down a mountainside both men were happy to make the change

4611060 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4611061 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust
4611062 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4611063 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family she was an immediate success there as well in part because the number of luo words in her vocabulary very soon surpassed mine we had a fine time in alego helping auma on a film project of hers listening to more of grannys stories meeting relatives id missed the first time around
4611064 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4611065 obamas story of his fathers life is dense presented in anything but a straightforward manner often glorified or embellished so as to mask much of the harsh and for obama probably painful truth
4611066 at the time i just saw that life at home became very difficult the old man never spoke to roy or myself except to scold us he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food ruth became very bitter at how the old man had changed finally roy just left he just stopped coming home and started living with different people so i was left alone with the old man sometimes i would stay up half the night waiting to hear him come through the door worrying that something terrible had happened then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed i would be so sleepy i wouldnt understand anything he was saying secretly i began to wish that he would just stay out one night and never come back
4611067 now as i sat in the glow of a single light bulb rocking slightly on a hard backed chair that image had suddenly vanished replaced by what a bitter drunk an abusive husband a defeated lonely bureaucrat to think that all my life i had been wrestling with nothing more than a ghost

4611072 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church no marriage license for this first marriage surfaces in any of the now growing volume of research being done yet even this remains murky

4611080 oh yea theres meat its just really tiny pieces in there
4611081 i love todays piece on moonlight in vermont and short of my preference for the konitz giuffre entry i would have had almost the same running order but it begs the question where is the sinatra version on your list it is 1 for me and as much as you clearly love sinatra i was shocked his version didnt make your top 12 i would love to read your thoughts on why the fs version doesnt make the cut thanks much and keep it up
4611082 on moonlight in vermont we hear the same gradations of color and tone as sinatras fluid legato style on this tune he chooses an airy relaxed approach and mays picturesque orchestration is sentimentally plush particularly noteworthy is the way sinatra using the harmonic changes in the orchestration to their best advantage imparts a half step key change as he glides from the word lovely to the word evening in the second chorus the transition is silky smooth the simple maneuver heightening the listeners anticipation at a critical point in the performance
4611083 i call it a brumromcom as it is set mostly round the canals brindleyplace and the mailbox
4611084 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour

4611115 make sure that gen mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4611116 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4611117 we have tried that in the 1990s we dont want to go down that path again
4611118 our unemployment rate will grow far worse and more californians will lose their jobs if we pass a budget that increases taxes
4611119 the worst thing you can do for the economy is make cuts especially to health care
4611120 i think its very clear that health care cuts specifically would have three times as great an economic impact as an increase of taxes on the upper income
4611121 while 7 3 percent of california workers and their families are struggling with unemployment all residents are facing higher energy and food prices and sharply lower home prices
4611122 it is abundantly clear that the states economy is sagging in a dramatic way with little sign of stabilization
4611123 what we really have is pretty much a housing recession and a slowdown in the rest of the economy
4611124 that results in a lot of volatility in our unemployment rate but theres no doubt that its trending up

4611286 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4611287 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4611288 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4611289 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4611290 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4611291 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4611292 theyre so inconsistent that a juror would have to look at that and say is this cooked testimony or not
4611293 i think theres a normal amount of play in the facts and i think its highly credible the testimony of both witnesses in the case
4611294 thats a wild statement and i think its a sign of desperation of the defense
4611295 there was nothing set up they were simply assaulted trying to serve a subpoena
4611296 he grabbed me with both hands around my shoulders and he threw me
4611297 my way of alleviating stress is to make light of certain things and to make a joke
4611298 when i was asked if this was newsworthy i was very hesitant
4611299 this is a very high profile incident involving someone of great stature
4611300 the next thing i knew the mayor was at the door
4611301 he was cursing and telling us to get off his property
4611302 the next thing i know he shoved det white into me
4611303 i stood there for a moment because i couldnt believe it
4611304 youre a black woman you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4611305 weve been very careful not to litigate this matter in the press
4611306 the fact that botswanas president would not attend this weekends sadc summit would not diminish the importance of unity within the region

4611311 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4611312 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4611313 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
4611314 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
4611315 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4611316 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4611317 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
4611318 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to

4611395 also appear as absolutely immense words im thinking those tags would cause any corporate marketer to smile rather than shudder

4611408 nos gustar a poder importar nuestros productos porque hay personas que los traen directo y pueden vender m s barato eso nos va a convenir a todos incluyendo a los consumidores

4611422 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows
4611423 everyone at pontlliw players is over the moon with the prop now weve got everything in place we cant wait for the show to begin

4611427 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4611428 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4611429 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4611430 i think the biggest thing was our timing on our routes last year we werent comfortable yet and it was all the small things when wed get to the red zone the smallest things matter and come to the top because everything is tighter everything is faster that was our biggest problem when we went through the spring and going into this fall everyone is getting a lot more comfortable and were timing things up right
4611431 yeah i think so we havent talked about it yet but im guessing itll be 50 50
4611432 as you know the newspaper industry is in the midst of tough economic times joining the ranks of so many other businesses in our market and across the u s
4611433 unfortunately in the short term we will be saying goodbye to some employees who have contributed to our success and that will be difficult
4611434 the goal however is to strengthen our company for the future and to get through this economic downturn in a way that positions us to grow
4611435 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4611436 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4611437 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4611438 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4611439 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy
4611440 upon request by your patient make available to another doctor a report of your findings and treatment

4611459 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4611460 thats the worst thing that could happen is that he doesnt return and that he surfaces in somebody elses community and changes his name
4611461 in music specifically the word syncretic refers to music that comprises a mixture of diverse elements vismaya is a stunning example of a magnificient mixture of musics concepts and cultures the music itself fuses the indian sound world with infectious rhythms and melodies of celtic music the listener is exposed to many genres lullabies marches jigs dances and prayers there is familiarity and freshness that combines folk and classical music the purity of performance and presentation is striking once again kanniks kannikeswaran has introduced us to a new sound world the sweet joyous and pure music sung by vidita kanniks is an auspicious beginning for a virtuosic twelve year old to research and produce this work of dikshitar in this way and at this moment in time is enlightening and propitous the recording provides an opening and opportunity for cross cultural connection and education in elementary and secondary schools let us celebrate this syncretic musical world called vismaya and let us look forward to all our collaborations to come if music is the means to share our diverse cultures and beauty is our goal knowledge about each other and understanding will be the outcome for a more peace filled world

4611466 she lost four fingers on one hand lost her eyelids ears nose and most of her hair she spent three months in the hospital almost a year in rehab and needed 32 reconstructive surgeries and other surgical procedures for the rest of her life shell have to use prosthetic devices and special creams for her damaged skin
4611467 i developed a detailed chronology of the case and explained all the medical procedures in lay terms
4611468 my services included indexing the records and explaining the difference between second and third degree burns i also pulled out every recorded instance of adams pain and suffering and prepared a chart listing all the pain medications sedatives etc she took
4611469 i had no idea what was being done to the plaintiff because much of it was in medical shorthand sharon indexed the records so we could find what we were looking for then on a daily basis she summarized adams condition treatments surgeries medications and outcome
4611470 we needed a handle on that sharon put all the procedures and surgeries into words we could understand for example debridement is just a medical term to me sharon explained that meant scrubbing off the dead skin when you see how often they did that you understand how much my client suffered
4611471 sharon tallied all the dosages for the first six weeks of treatment then concluded by saying my client had received enough medicine to relieve the pain of 850 heart attacks or 1 700 3 400 hours of labor that vivid picture of what adams went through gave us an advantage over the defense attorney when we started talking about damages
4611472 and we settled in about a day sharons summary made the damages so evident we never had to discuss them this made for a cleaner conference focused on the liability issues
4611473 was the understanding of the medical records sharon gave us
4611474 i cant read 4 000 pages of medical records having the services of someone like sharon allows me to take on complex cases that i could not handle otherwise
4611475 i trust her judgment and her opinions more than i would a nurse working in my own office an independent consultant doesnt have an ax to grind with you if you get a case of questionable merit sharon will tell you not to pursue it
4611476 you can lose a lot of money on cases with complex medical issues if youre not on firm ground
4611477 my out of pocket expenses on the adams case were around 240 000 sharon can quickly and economically identify whether you have a case and she can cut down on your staff time going through medical records if youre in a small or medium sized firm and you need help indexing records or understanding complex medical issues a certified legal nurse consultant is indispensable

4611509 der bgh hat hier einen streit zwischen den gro en vier der energieversorger und der bundesnetzagentur zu gunsten der regulierungsbeh rde entschieden

4611555 even if he retaliates and harms me i shall continue to speak the truth
4611556 i had done a lot of things like paint cars and paint furniture so painting was a byproduct of my previous work
4611557 i went home and did my first piece of kinetic art that very night it simply said the words new man because i felt like a new man
4611558 i asked him if he would sell me one rod of glass
4611559 he did for 50 cents that rod represented the fish tank i took it home and put some different marks on paper and rolled the rod around on it and i realized it worked so i went back to the mall the next morning and bought a bunch more rods and went home and produced my first piece i sold those right away and that was it
4611560 if i have four images in one work of art i have to paint the images one fourth their original width
4611561 then i have to cut a slice off of the number one painting and glue it down a slice off of number two and glue it down then three then four and all four of those slices have to be narrow enough and straight enough to fit under one rod of glass so if theres a picture that has 100 rods of glass there are 400 strips of art
4611562 i dont know of anyone else who has done this but i have done this with as many as seven complete images in one piece of art and thats with small rods
4611563 instead of a picture just changing from one image to another i will have 10 images between two pictures and each one of those images will gradually morph one image into the other image
4611564 i am also now doing animation i have a horse running through a field or i have a butterfly opening and closing its wings on a flower while bees fly around it im always doing something new

4611571 our defense really worked today we were able to save two runs on two defensive plays
4611572 we are very happy the team played as one big cohesive unit

4611588 i believe that cost savings can be had from other towns if we broaden the scope of the study
4611589 i still have questions about it but thought i would give voters a chance to voice their opinions on it and to try to get available funding to obtain the experts necessary to analyze consolidation
4611590 shall a joint municipal consolidation study commission be formed to study the feasibility of consolidating between the boroughs of demarest and haworth provided that there is no direct cost to either municipality for the costs of convening the commission nor for engaging professionals to perform the necessary studies and prepare reports of the commission such municipal operations and services as may be fiscally prudent and desirable and to make non binding recommendations thereon

4611593 whatever the shortfall is on the servicing of the 3 million bond we will pick up
4611594 so if the garage makes 150 000 annually and the servicing is 300 000 which i think is generally what it is well pick up the 150 000 if the garage gets to the point where its making 250 000 annually and the shortfall is only 50 000 well make up the 50 000
4611595 if thats the promise then its a damn good promise
4611596 the remainder to be financed by self liquidating bonds and notes and fees from the parking deck
4611597 it doesnt pay quite frankly for the cost of the ground the maintenance the meters themselves the rates really should be increased to 50 cents
4611598 i think the way weve morphed that is were paying you for the ground underneath the retail space
4611599 whatever the shortfall is on the servicing of the 3 million bond we will pick up
4611600 so if the garage makes 150 000 annually and the servicing is 300 000 which i think is generally what it is well pick up the 150 000 if the garage gets to the point where its making 250 000 annually and the shortfall is only 50 000 well make up the 50 000

4611608 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4611609 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4611610 we know that asthma prevalence is higher among boys than girls but that the condition later in life is more prevalent in women than men
4611611 this study is particularly exciting as it provides an insight into the mechanisms involved in asthma development during the transition period between childhood and adulthood demonstrating how we can influence these processes and develop new targeted therapies

4611642 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4611643 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4611644 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4611645 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4611659 is the cultural equivalent of two generations of english scholars simply not noticing that joyce has quoted the start of hamlet at the start of ulysses there can be no clearer evidence that the k myth quite literally makes people even highly educated german scholars incapable of reading what kafka actually wrote
4611660 kafkology examines kafkas books not in the large context of literary history the history of the european novel but almost exclusively in the microcontext of biography
4611661 how do you get from here to the rest of the world

4611664 ive had to fill in some parts from my own imagination
4611665 hed gradually broken loose from the landscape that produced him hed become so light that he blew across the border like a feather
4611666 it was a rocky boat because i was thrown into the middle of an established judging panel
4611667 having me there completely threw it out of its rhythm which is what i was there to do because it was getting so samey
4611668 i dont hate anyone but she made it clear she hated me
4611669 i dont know why there was a lot of stuff that went on backstage that contractually i cant talk about lets just say there were a lot of different opinions flying around
4611670 i asked simon cowell the chief judge about that comment and he said its not fair nobodys ever said that about me
4611671 hopefully i showed by the end of the series that i was there for my musical ability
4611672 leon and rhydian last years winner and runner up respectively were both mentored by me so while people were busy saying i was just there for my looks i was working away and getting the job done
4611673 even if i was a viewer id have to assume that it did
4611674 i always ask louis how many girls aloud shows did you go to again louis
4611675 its really hard to spot who might win at this point
4611676 you need to wait till boot camp which is where you start to see everyone either fall to pieces or really shock you well see how it goes once we get our teams together and the rumbles start
4611677 but down the hall from your room is a vending machine that should serve your purposes
4611678 if you find something on the floor if you find credits on a machine if you find a voucher find a casino employee and let them know and give that to them
4611679 keep it im not gonna go and look for somebody and ask them if they lost 20
4611680 you take it to the lost and found and say hi heres a dollar bill i found
4611681 what possible claim does anybody else have to that dollar bill that would be superior to yours
4611682 a sprinkler system is like having a firefighter 24 7 in your house theyre right there when that fire starts they put it out right away
4611683 it was really scary because i was just screaming for her because i was sure that she was roaming around in this house somewhere
4611684 basically all we had to do is water removal instead of actually having to tear cabinets out and rip ceilings down
4611685 everyone is a robot except for me and my monkey
4611686 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4611687 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4611688 all personel in the bank feel safe customers that come in feel safe
4611689 they could have a trenchcoat on with a hat and glasses then at that point we could tell them to remove those items before they enter the facility

4611694 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4611695 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4611696 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day
4611697 i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4611698 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4611699 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4611700 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4611701 deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4611702 we want them the russians out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometre of its sovereign territory never ever
4611703 what if you couldnt marry the person you love every day gay and lesbian couples are prevented from marrying
4611704 on one level i really like this approach because it uses the wedding industrial complex against itself taking the ultimate heteronormative capitalist celebration and turning it into an argument for equality i like that
4611705 is directly targeted at the 8 to 10 percent of undecided california voters it is not for people who have already decided to vote no on prop 8 who are likely the same people who will question traditional wedding customs and what is a proper marriage this ad basically makes the marriage proposition one about fairness and equality
4611706 i would rather see an ad that queered marriage than one that shows a rich white couple getting married and suggests that everyone else should be able to be like them as if its the goal that everyone should aspire to
4611707 it sounds like texas high school football has gone soft
4611708 the idea of serving sushi at a texas high school football game just flies in the face of everything i know about texas high school football

4611711 anchorman 2 doesnt exactly sounds uhh promising this coming from mtv
4611712 last i heard they were starting to write it and they were thinking about setting it in the eighties
4611713 but i know when we were shooting it director adam mckay said if they ever did something it would have to be really weird like we were on the moon or something i think it has to go even further if it was to work
4611714 i dont know if its a throwaway comment adam mckay had made at some premiere or something i think hes s interested in the idea i think will ferrell is too
4611715 certainly it was so fun to make that if they were to do another one i think wed all be really interested in it
4611716 i believe its pronounced yawgging with a soft j everything about it was so retro
4611717 departing now jesus was on his way from the temple but his disciples approched to show him the buildings of the temple
4611718 do you not behold all these things truly i say to you by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down
4611719 tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things
4611720 look out that nobody misleads you for many will come on the basis of my name saying i am the messiah and will mislead many you are going to hear fo wars and reports of wars see that you are not terrified
4611721 for these things must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress the people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you and you will be objects of hatred by all nations on account of my name then also many will be stumbed and will betray one another and will hate one another and many false prophets will arise and mislead many and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved and this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come
4611722 however keep on remembering the former days in which after you were enlightned you endured a great contest under sufferings sometimes while you were being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations and sometimes while you became sharers with those who were having such an experience for you both expressed sympathy for those in prison and joyfully took the plundering of your belongings knowing you yourselves have a better and an abiding possession do not therefore throw away your freeness of speech which has a great reward to be paid it for you have need of endurance in order that after you have done the will of god you may receive the fulfillment of the promise for yet a very little while and he who is coming will arrive and will not delay but my righteous one will live by reason of faith and if he shrinks back my soul has no pleasure in him now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul
4611723 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4611724 we watch it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4611725 i have to come and check on him to make sure hes ok
4611726 por el momento la compa a no puede brindar mayores precisiones al respecto salvo que la misma cooper con el allanamiento
4611727 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4611728 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4611729 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4611730 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4611731 well work pretty much everything backed up against our own goal red zone offense and defense third down and fourth down scenarios and end of game situations
4611732 all our special teams will be live and good on good the first team against the second team weve got some new guys filling key roles and we need to identify them at this stage of camp
4611733 we got a lot done covering a lot of situations again we had a good work and got a lot of special teams work in
4611734 it looks like well have some bruised up guys back out there saturday and that will be a boost too
4611735 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4611736 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4611737 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4611738 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4611739 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4611740 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4611741 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4611742 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4611743 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4611744 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4611745 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4611746 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4611747 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4611748 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4611749 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4611750 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4611751 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4611752 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4611753 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4611754 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4611755 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4611756 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4611757 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4611758 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4611759 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4611760 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4611761 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4611762 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4611763 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4611764 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4611765 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4611766 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4611767 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4611768 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4611769 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4611770 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4611771 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4611772 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4611773 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4611774 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4611775 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4611776 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4611777 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4611778 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4611779 stereotypes are part of the fabric that makes us human
4611780 t he stingy jew the black thief the muslim terrorist the promiscuous homosexual the latino machista the child molesting priest
4611781 there is a shady side to human beings innate or conditioned that is seduced by corruption monotheistic religions refer to it as an inclination for evil other religions or philosophical and spiritual schools of thought define it in other ways although they all share a universal truth in the journey through life we have been given tools conscience education morals to overcome it
4611782 there are some immigrants who arrive with the delusion that they will have a comfortable life in the blink of an eye instant believers in the american dream even though they didnt bring a hard work ethic which is the very pillar of this nations prosperity
4611783 the collective personality of many groups has been nourished by current or historic elements that are often essential for survival
4611784 in cuba especially during the past two decades the totalitarian regime and economic crisis have fostered a modus operandi based on pure survival in which illegal activity has become misinterpreted as normal many people are demoralized formal education is at an all time low and what kind of example are children getting if their parents steal for a living when they emigrate sometimes they carry their discontent as baggage
4611785 it is not just the cubans that left in the past few years who are committing crimes
4611786 who arrived in 1961 and were recently charged with healthcare related wire fraud and income tax evasion
4611787 the most successful immigrants in the history of this nation of immigrants
4611788 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4611789 this is a planning took where all things are going
4611790 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4611791 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4611792 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4611793 con la advertencia de que ser a una canci n para todos los gustos para que nadie se sintiera discriminado

4611798 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4611799 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4611800 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4611801 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4611802 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4611803 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4611804 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4611805 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4611806 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4611807 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4611808 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4611809 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4611810 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4611811 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4611812 the increase in leveling speed allows players to create new characters and advance nearly twice as fast as before this will allow players to experience the meat of lineage ii quickly giving them the ability to visit new and exciting areas and cool high level content much quicker than before while this game is still a hardcore game these changes with gracia part 1 make the game much more accessible to new players i hope gamers will take another look at what lineage ii has to offer
4611813 the part played by labour in the transition from ape to man
4611814 it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness
4611815 discourse on the origin and basis of inequality among men
4611816 i thought it was germany that invaded poland in 1939
4611817 mother russia is a national personification of russia appearing in patriotic posters statues etc
4611818 in 2005 israel produced only minimal quantities of oil and imported approximately 249 000 bbl d of crude oil and products to meet domestic needs traditionally major oil import sources have included egypt the north sea west africa and mexico in recent years however israel has increased imports from russia and the caspian and now reportedly buys three fourths of its oil from this region israel has begun to import larger quantities of azeri oil which is lighter and sweeter than the russian urals crude and easily transported through the newly inaugurated baku tiblisi ceyhan btc pipeline
4611819 well at least we should be glad that bush can see through to putins soul putin is sure taking advantage of this lame duck period and the fact our eyes arent centered on russia we havent kept our enemy close enough to us and we screwed up big time there

4611824 twenty nine of our next 41 games are against teams with winning records
4611825 he is the most intellectually inconsistent politician in the history of politics i have never seen anyone so completely without any commitment to any particular principle and so willing to say whatever he thinks will help him win the next election
4611826 has long been a vocal critic of romney and has been a controversial figure himself he is an openly gay member of congress who was formally reprimanded by congress in 1990 for his relationship with a male prostitute who claimed to run an escort service out of franks apartment when he was not home
4611827 ironically republican larry craig of idaho at that time pushed for more severe penalties for frank such as expulsion or censure craig now a senator is involved in his own scandal after pleading guilty to lewd conduct in a minneapolis airport restroom
4611828 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama
4611829 obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing clinton by agreeing to a roll call vote for her nomination that he might not have had much choice if he wanted peace only proves the point that hes playing defense at his own convention
4611830 many backers of clinton have been vigorously pushing for her candidacy to be validated through a roll call vote the proceedings could take place on the same night that former president bill clinton is to deliver his convention speech
4611831 who am i that i should speak to these people
4611832 who are you you are the guy that god almighty hangs out with
4611833 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
4611834 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
4611835 it is to our understanding that pastor warren simply contacted senators mccain and obama to invite them to participate in this forum
4611836 we feel that the addition of congressman bob barr to this event will expand the debate on issues and benefit those who watch and learn from the forum the dialogue between the three main candidates in this election will educate and inform voters more so than a forum that restricts the discussion to the frequently heard talking points of senators obama and mccain
4611837 weve had calls placed to pastor warren from very powerful leaders from the left and the right we sent in our personal request and placed numerous phone calls that have not been returned you are not going to be included
4611838 our only option left is to threaten to file an temporary injunction as our attorneys believe they are in violation of the law

4611841 they marketed things to investors making specific representations about liquidity but failing to disclose to them that there were potential risks in the marketplace that might affect their ability to actually provide the liquidity they claimed was available
4611842 the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4611843 there can be no negotiated capitulations and negotiated dismemberment of smaller countries by bigger ones
4611844 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4611845 the free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications of this russian attack on its neighbor for security in the region and beyond
4611846 the long term economic potential of latin america makes this an extremely important market for video games
4611847 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states
4611848 army is my calling when i kill an enemy i feel that i do good for my country

4611852 hypsilophodon had elongated legs and a stiffened counterbalancing tail that suggest it was almost certainly a fast runner
4611853 the plates might have functioned to support the ribcage during fast running
4611854 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones
4611855 our careful reexamination of the specimens shows however that the bony plates are always closely associated with the outside surface of the ribs from the front end of the ribcage and are certainly not armor

4611866 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4611867 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4611868 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4611869 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4611870 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4611871 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4611872 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4611873 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4611874 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4611875 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4611876 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4611877 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4611878 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4611879 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4611880 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4611881 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4611882 an album as hummably lovely as it is knowingly referencing of a certain tradition of neo psychedelic english whimsy
4611883 its a brave bonkers often beautiful sometimes haunting and occasionally ridiculous album
4611884 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4611885 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4611886 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4611887 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4611888 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4611889 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4611890 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4611891 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4611892 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4611893 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4611894 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4611895 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4611896 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4611897 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4611898 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4611899 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4611900 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4611901 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4611902 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4611903 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4611904 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4611905 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4611906 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4611907 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4611908 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4611909 the draft regulation would define birth control as abortion it could deny access to critical family planning for women across the country
4611910 although as youve probably read our organization american media is under the gun they have nevertheless devoted really big money to this
4611911 the enormous amounts we know edwards is spending to keep it contained
4611912 we have exclusive photographic evidence pictures videos hard proof to further incriminate edwards he doesnt at this point know what we have which is why im asking that we dont reveal too much yet and which we will use unless and until he acknowledges paternity
4611913 she believes theyll be together in future because elizabeths health concerns make it just a matter of time whatever hes said in her mind the clock is running we know this
4611914 although edwards has this loyalist andrew young trying to claim its really his baby in order to take the heat off edwards we know thats false
4611915 for now shes following whatever script hes written for her

4612047 i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath
4612048 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital he was in intensive care the whole time and he contracted a second strain of pneumonia while in the hospital
4612049 for all their fame and all star doctors teaching hospitals carry risks of their own the sickest patients often have compromised immune systems and may need to be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics which increases the chance that antibiotic resistant strains of staph and other bacteria will make the rounds of the intensive care unit
4612050 he had sarcoidosis but it was in remission but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
4612051 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4612052 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
4612053 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius

4612059 when i said i wanted to sing like that jerry said the best way was to get a pianist and learn how those songs are done
4612060 one thing jerry wexler taught me was that if youve got a sexy or torchy song you mustnt attitudinize on top of it because it sounds redundant

4612110 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4612111 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4612112 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4612113 this has in a way shielded us from the impact of the slowdown

4612125 the university has not changed its plans to destroy 120 acres of forest and add 4 500 students to this already overburdened city so our opposition is still essential

4612180 people are more aware of signs of a heart attack and rush to a hospital even if they have a minor chest pain but for brain stroke the initial symptoms are often missed or misinterpreted as weakness however tia symptoms should be taken seriously as they are markers of an impending brain stroke
4612181 in a survey conducted three decades ago the incidence was 39 79 per 100 000 population but recent studies show that the prevalence is nearly 250 300 per 100 000 population in some pockets of india it is as high as 800 900 per 100 000 population
4612182 till two decades ago strokes were more common among older people
4612183 because of high blood pressure the arteries sometimes rupture causing bleeding in the brain stress also indirectly contributes to a stroke as it raises the chances of other medical conditions like high blood pressure
4612184 a person can be paralysed or suffer vision or speech loss depending on which part of the brain has been affected the window period for reversing the damage provided the patient has been taken care of in the initial few minutes is three hours in case of brain stroke

4612210 power generation through a non conventional source was one of the supplementary initiatives proposed by us for approval from the railway board soon tenders will be floated for appointing a private party who would create the necessary infrastructure
4612211 we have an estimated generation capacity of around 100 mw to 200 mw depending on the success of this project we may explore the coastal belt in maharashtra as well
4612212 there is a possibility that the railways will pool in this capacity to the grid and use it for their day to day operations or they may also trade it as non conventional energy earns good revenue for the power generators
4612213 one gram may appear very insignificant but if this rationalisation is done across say 5000 components that go into making a car the actual reduction amounts to 5 kg steel prices are increasing and so curtailing input weight is important
4612214 this is awesome to give red bull their first pole and in what a fashion
4612215 we really stepped it up today and i dont know sometimes the car is just right and you dont really know why
4612216 obviously its because of a lot of hard work but why it was that right that was just an unbelievable lap ive never had a car that good in qualifying
4612217 if we can have it that good the whole race we would be in great shape obviously the race is a completely different environment but weve got a good baseline to start with and well try to make the most of it and try to make it good on the long run
4612218 we were a little bit lucky that the cloud was right above the racetrack when we qualified
4612219 well start in the top ten so im happy about that weve done a good improvement
4612220 i dont know whats wrong with it the car has a tremendous amount of speed we just cant get it to do what it needs to do i was all the way out of the gas and almost got in the fence i came about an inch from the fence and lost probably half a second
4612221 its just getting laps in these cars at these speeds at these kind of tracks you just have to gain confidence

4612245 we have such a poor choice of candidates to start with as far as i am concerned thats just a matter of opinion though
4612246 there are so many other issues in the world other than abortion that we need to be thinking about
4612247 there is a small pocket of voters who put the social issues at the top regardless of the economy or how much it costs at the pump
4612248 the social conservative base is probably the hardest working part of the base and you certainly want them to be motivated and part of the team
4612249 a lot of things have happened in this century and most of them plug into walls
4612250 a change in an environment is rarely only additive or linear what you have is a totally new environment requiring a whole new repertoire of survival strategies
4612251 when you plug something into a wall someone is getting plugged into you which means you need new patterns of defense perception understanding evaluation you need a new kind of education
4612252 as the number of messages increases the amount of information carried decreases we have more media to communicate fewer significant ideas
4612253 change isnt new whats new is the degree of change change changed
4612254 change occurs so rapidly that each of us in the course of our lives has continuously to work out a set of values beliefs and patterns of behavior that are viable or seem viable to each of us personally and just when we have identified a workable system it turns out to be irrelevant because so much has changed while we were doing it
4612255 the trouble is that most teachers have the idea that they are in some other sort of business some believe for example that they are in the information dissemination business
4612256 while students have to live with tv film the lp record communication satellites and the laser beam their teachers are still talking as if the only medium on the scene is gutenbergs printing press
4612257 while students have to understand psychology and psychedelics anthropology and anthropomorphism birth control and biochemistry their teachers are teaching subjects that mostly dont exist anymore
4612258 while students need to find new roles for themselves as social political and religious organisms their teachers are acting almost entirely as shills for corporate interests shaping them up to be functionaries in one bureaucracy or another
4612259 future shock occurs when you are confronted by the fact that the world you were educated to believe in doesnt exist
4612260 we just may not survive another generation of inadvertent entropy helpers
4612261 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4612263 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4612264 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4612265 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4612266 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4612267 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4612270 the only way this blog would be better is if she dedicated 50 of the posts to affordable housing
4612271 not as good as beth spotswoods blog but i like it anyway
4612272 geopolitical concerns and the realisation that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4612273 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries said yesterday
4612274 of course its not legal to sell another human being into slavery
4612275 i think what you did with the penny drive was very cool
4612276 oh i couldnt possibly organize such an event thats too big
4612277 you should make a list of all the products like that and the reasons to buy or not buy them so you dont have to wonder everytime you are at the store
4612278 didnt lincoln take care of that back in the 1800s
4612279 do we settle for the world as it is or fight for the world as it should be
4612280 i hope they release us tonight so we can go home
4612281 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
4612282 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
4612283 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
4612284 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
4612285 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
4612286 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
4612287 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
4612288 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
4612289 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
4612290 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
4612291 the courts run by the government are active around the country
4612292 married adults report better health but singles are catching up
4612293 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier
4612294 the never married are relatively immune to any apparent disadvantage associated with the stress of marital dissolution
4612295 the gap between the married and the never married is closing especially for men
4612296 the self rated health status of the never married has improved for all race and gender groups examined and it is more similar to the married for men now than ever before which suggests that encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided in fact getting married increases ones risk for eventual marital dissolution and marital dissolution seems to be worse for self rated health now than at any point in the past three decades
4612297 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
4612298 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
4612299 has a kind of deliberate ugliness that has been exploited as a gimmick
4612300 and that it was going to be a much more coherent show than last years and therefore the work id put in had not been wasted
4612301 embraces diversity in its entries and it is important to us that we remain open to the many styles through which artists engage with the subject area
4612302 the fact that he admitted he doesnt like my work shows that hes being subjective and close minded and not academic at all
4612303 its not ugly and its not shocking i dont see how anyone can be offended by such a familiar image as christ on the cross
4612304 based on their research our estimation at this time is if its good in australia why wont it be good here
4612305 this is a tool this is a kind of bathing suit you can use if you want
4612306 each local y handles these situations as they see appropriate
4612307 weve known cases where employers or institutions tend to jump the gun too fast in saying the hijab should be banned
4612308 its not about whether the person wearing the hijab is making excessive demands the question is whether the institution or the employer has taken reasonable steps in order to understand and to find accommodations if possible
4612309 i want to show that you can wear a turban and still be canadian
4612310 when some of them first heard about this a few said this is the canadian team not the indian team
4612311 this is no different than wearing a cross on your chest or a jewish yarmulke during the opening ceremonies which nobody would have any problem with
4612312 were a country of immigrants and this is a celebration of canada and the fact that in our country you can be anything you want to be i think its great that italian canadians gather at shops along commercial drive in vancouver and in toronto to cheer on the italian national soccer team nobody bats an eye about that nobody they mean no offence and we also mean no offence
4612313 my dad had to cut his beard and lose his turban to get a job when he came to canada in 1970
4612314 now we can choose to wear a turban or not and it doesnt affect anybody making a living now we can celebrate that evolution of our country during the opening ceremonies i want people to think about canadians coming in all kinds of packages and yet were all still canadians
4612315 the sikh community in b c has been very good to us it raised 15 000 in one weekend to help in our preparations for beijing and as captain i have no problem with this turbans in the opening ceremonies
4612316 we all bring something of our backgrounds to our national team and as canadians at the olympics this is a part of who ravi bindi ranjeev and gabbar are my parents are english and thats why i came to play field hockey and not ice hockey
4612317 pete asked if he could wear a turban too during the opening ceremonies
4612318 i said maybe when we get back to canada and have our post games party
4612319 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
4612320 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
4612321 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
4612322 female suicide bombers cost little provide ease of planning and are relatively free of risk to terror organizations there is little chance that security forces will obtain sensitive information from them
4612323 we hope that more women will join us in this work
4612324 we are helping our brothers to protect the new iraq
4612325 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
4612326 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
4612327 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
4612328 we are sorry for the incident and the damage to the equipment that belonged to the reporters
4612329 the uep is a charitable trust that is to hold use and distribute uep trust property to provide for those individuals who previously made contributions to the uep trust or the flds church
4612330 the uep is a utah trust but it owns land in bountiful
4612331 the people up there in bountiful said we used to own that school and since this rift between winston and warren weve lost possession of that school
4612332 we got word that they were trying to sell the property liquidate it take the cash and move and start a new compound somewhere
4612333 we filed the lawsuit two years ago to try and resolve that before that happened now were in the process of trying to resolve that
4612334 i dont know if we can but were going to try
4612335 deny that bess acquired the properties in trust for the uep
4612336 in particular these defendants say that the bess properties were acquired and are being maintained and held by bess in accordance with the purposes and objects of bess as set forth in its constitution and bylaws
4612337 shall be transferred and delivered to the trustees of the uep in trust which does not create a trust in favour of the uep
4612338 some of the people who used to be in the church and had been kicked out sued jeffs civilly
4612339 if were successful that bess property will come back into the trust and were going to say this is an open school anybody can come
4612340 the old trust before it was reformed in 2006 was very religious oriented
4612341 if you didnt believe in warren jeffs you couldnt play ball with them
4612342 our trust has been reformed and religion has been carved out
4612343 this is a secular trust there are no religious issues we cannot discriminate based on religion
4612344 if you live on uep property you can come to the school
4612345 part of the problem now is the people who are running it dont like the blackmore group so they dont let them come to the school
4612346 we were a sitting target for litigation because we have all this real estate with no debt
4612347 anybody who thinks warren jeffs has wronged them has sued the trust
4612348 were defending eight or 10 lawsuits down here where people claim warren harmed them and the trust should be liable
4612349 to manage lease and rent uep properties and the authority to sell assets of the uep in order to raise money for the payment of property taxes
4612350 legally we have that power but we dont intend to use it
4612351 people up there in bountiful are paying their taxes but down here flds members refused to pay taxes for the first year
4612352 investigators believe the evidence demonstrates that the death of the infant is directly related to the intentional severing of the umbilical cord
4612353 the answer is going to best be reserved for court as to what the motive was
4612354 the authorities in harare should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy

4612358 this is one individuals action which he did off his own back but which we support in terms of direct action we will support people this one well one of our activist coordinators only heard about it last night but provided its non violent direct action well support it
4612359 at the moment we give people an outlet for their frustration
4612360 these arent stunts these are emergency calls this is us sounding the alarm about something everyone is aware of family breakdown mass fatherlessness is a problem in this country but politicians dont seem to recognise it
4612361 people were caught in traffic for 90 minutes thats a click of the fingers compared to a man separated from his kids for a week a month a year
4612362 the sad thing is everything needs to look like an action movie to get in the news
4612363 they dont want intelligent argument they need something eye catching or else you dont get your message out
4612364 in 2004 there was a plan to shut down the m25 entirely and all the railway lines going into london
4612365 the largest constituency of floating voters is single mothers and women i mean the swing from when
4612366 all the main parties toe the line on this we wont solve it unless we keep up the pressure even if traffic disruption is not a current fathers 4 justice strategy
4612367 this time i want to come and play my new new style
4612368 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4612369 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4612370 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4612371 we urge you to support measures that would avert further damage to the already beleaguered global non proliferation and disarmament regime
4612372 question the usual because girls somehow love this particular question for some very peculiar reason so i thought it would be ok to just say a bit more deeply about myself yeah right

4612385 a top police official of the rank of joint commissioner has informed the maharashtra home department that the mumbai teams role was only supportive in nature
4612386 it would have been logical for the mumbai police to recommend its men also for the award
4612387 what may be a gallant act for another state may not be considered so in mumbai where such encounters are very regular
4612388 the standards set by our police officers and the expectations from them may be of a higher level
4612389 please come and listen to me no no no ono no hes saying leave me alone

4612392 i recently had the chance to catch up on some of your columns from the past month and was pleasantly surprised by your story about 105 year old dona berta gomez
4612393 your column brought us great joy remembering what a wonderful woman she was it also reminded us about how easy it is to give back to the community simply visiting an elderly neighbor or a shut in brings so much joy not only to that person but also to yourself
4612394 i read with interest the article about our legislatures latest issuance on pet trusts
4612395 during one of our conversations she told me about the maltese puppy trouble her grandson had recently given her
4612396 imagine my delight when the news came out that trouble had inherited 12 million also imagine my disappointment when i was left nothing
4612397 when we arrived the front gate was locked we went around to the servants entrance and that was where everyone was going in the party was held on the lawn by the pool and there were portable toilets we were the only social guests everyone else was a lawyer a doctor an interior designer etc she used real china and silver when i had to go to the bathroom i marched myself into the house i didnt come all the way from california to go in a portable toilet the house was gorgeous in the kitchen there was a vault for silver i heard that it was always counted before guests could leave

4612399 seattle sounders fc have signed kasey to a two year contract
4612400 as an expansion team in 2009 seattle held the number one allocation ranking the club used that allocation to acquire keller
4612401 kasey is arguably the top goalkeeper that the united states has ever produced
4612402 he is a natural leader and those leadership qualities should be of enormous value to sounders fc
4612403 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4612404 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4612417 its nature you cant explain it if we knew what was causing it we could hopefully prevent it
4612418 i cant tell you why there are more mosquitoes this year than last if you had called last year and asked why there were less i couldnt tell you either
4612419 i think a lot of it has to do with the temperature the amount of rainfall and the amount of vegetation but if you want a definitive answer there isnt one this is something where you could do a full blown research project to find out why there are more mosquitoes and still have no answer
4612420 when we find a positive pool we put out additional traps out in that area to try to better define the area where the positive mosquitoes are there will be more positive mosquitoes where we find a positive
4612421 the other states in the country obviously received substantially smaller allocations than colorado

4612427 what were trying to do is carry items that a lot of the other stores dont carry
4612428 we had 18 pairs of each that was a pretty hot shoe
4612429 i think seattles a couple years behind new york l a and tokyo
4612430 what were really trying to do is push seattle to the forefront of fashion combining it with b boying art seattle could be the next atl atlanta as far as hip hop goes
4612431 the question is has he learnt nothing from the two previous campaigns and the impact that rushing players back can have dear god man one hopes that arsene means that kolo is going to sit on the bench rather than start the match

4612447 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4612448 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4612449 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4612450 its not just one site its really eight sites where people buried their dead but also lived

4612454 we are so happy that the city is finally doing something about the parking situation in our neighbourhood
4612455 its been a real detraction from the neighbourhood and the property values for a long long time
4612456 at every corner on every side street theres somebody jumping out waving a sign saying 5 6
4612457 have been in place for a long time and this year theyre finally going to enforce it and were thrilled
4612458 we know that there were more than two dozen cases we dont know if that represents the totality of the targeting there is a lot that is unknown
4612459 i think for most people in the south asian community this would come as a huge shock and a surprise as well
4612460 the women were not allowed to come and they were not allowed to come because canada did not want any permanent settlement of south asians so there were about only about five women who came
4612461 whats so funny about this 1915 trial is that you can see how hard the nascent municipal government was trying to associate these sikh males with homosexuality to the point where they were involved in very aggressive hands on entrapment
4612462 whether the acts they are accused of engaging in actually happened or not or were they fantasies of the police officers or whether there was an issue of the arrested individuals not being able to bribe police out of being arrested those are the great historical questions that we may never be able to answer
4612463 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot

4612465 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4612466 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4612467 they also want to avoid a scenario where shes leading at any point
4612468 you are the 78th member this is because the sound will spiral outwards from left to right like dna from deep inside of us right out to you the 77 drum group is one giant instrument one living creature the 77 boadrum will coil like a snake and transform to become a great dragon eye

4612471 they are really tired right now and i dont have a problem with that
4612472 it lets me know weve worked them hard enough if weve got a football team that is just laughing and enjoying everything were doing then were probably not working hard enough youve got to get them ready to play the first game but the thing is you cant overwork them to the point where youve got nobody left to play the first game somewhere in the middle is where you want to be i dont know if thats where we are right now but i feel good about our football team
4612473 as long as were getting good effort at practice then we are going to continue and do what were doing and know that our guys are going to give us their best shot theyve got to trust us that when its time to back off a little bit we can do that but weve got to push hard enough to get ready to play a tough schedule that includes 12 great teams
4612474 its been pretty tough everyone is bigger stronger and faster than you
4612475 i thought they would really throw us in there and wed be getting our butts kicked but they are kind of keeping us on the side
4612476 weve mostly been working on individual drills and special teams scouts a lot of it is just trying to learn everything but a lot of upperclassmen and all the linebackers are really helpful with that they are very encouraging and work with the younger guys a lot
4612477 when i first got here it was a terrible situation i felt like our older players did not treat our young guys very well
4612478 through the years thats changed i dont know if in the past guys felt intimidated by younger players but once the older guys saw that i was looking to make a football team out of veterans it got better if you go to the dining hall the old guys are sitting with the young guys in practice the older guys are helping the new guys with techniques its a healthy situation i dont think the old guys are intimidated at all by the younger players in fact they know we may have to count on a couple of them to help us theyve been good at trying to get the guys up to speed as quickly as possible
4612479 by monday well start to see our guys get their legs back under them theyll be in a better frame of mind mentally and start eliminating a few more of the silly mistakes
4612480 sekarang kita biarkan parlimen bersidang seperti biasa kita tidak perlu tergesa gesa kerana tidak ada sebab untuk kita tergesa gesa kerana saya yakin

4612497 a whole new thing was happening there the first time you had two black models in the same issue of a magazine and maybe in the same spread it was a really exciting time no other magazines were doing that
4612498 i sued to think that unless my hair was was washed and set and tamed that is was a mess
4612499 and this is where the role model thing comes in with models like myself coming in who are portrayed with their natural hair little black girl began seeing images that reflected themselves roshumba coming in with her own short hair unprocessed i think thats so beautiful im not putting down people who have weaves and everything having a range is whats important

4612520 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world

4612524 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

4612572 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4612573 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4612574 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
4612575 i think carlos cuellar was a fantastic player for rangers
4612576 he was only there for last season and obviously he wants to get into the spanish national team and you cant deny playing in the premier league is going to give him a better opportunity of that
4612577 i think from rangers perspective they brought him in for just over 2 million and sold him for 8m thats a good bit of business but obviously the supporters dont see it like that and they are bitterly disappointed to have lost one of their better players
4612578 it is a very big game i think it is a massive game
4612579 and i think it is a game when youre at home and youre a football player and you see the game on the tv and think i wish i could be involved in a game like that
4612580 i think definitely its important for me to get out and play football
4612581 there are great fans here the coaching staff have been superb and everyone has made me welcome
4612582 at the end of the day to have european football on your cv something that you want so its definitely something i will look into
4612583 he gives us experience we dont have a lot of experience in the forward line he holds the ball up well runs the channels and his link up play is pretty decent as well
4612584 i got a bit of info on him and everyone said he was very hard but fair and i think that is all you can really ask for out of a manager
4612585 hes passionate he was like that as a player and hes got belief in me and that is somebody i want to work with
4612586 at the end of the day i want to score goals but i want to do well for myself which is important as a player
4612587 but i want to keep getting into the international sides and as soon as i heard that dundee united were interested it was a no brainer for me
4612588 would you be interested in playing baseball or soccer or football
4612589 its a titanium box that protects your money if the bad guys try to break in it explodes
4612590 steven davis is a player we have been interested in and hopefully we can do something there but we just have to wait and see
4612591 since the end of last season we have been trying hard to bring in some players who we feel will improve positions which need improved so it has been an ongoing thing
4612592 its always a slow process in the sense that most clubs wait until nearer the end of the transfer deadline
4612593 weve been in negotiations with a number of clubs and lost out on a number of players so we continue to try to get players in who we think will improve us
4612594 weve got one or two signings we would like to make before the deadline so hopefully we have a couple more before we are finished

4612610 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4612611 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4612612 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4612622 the parallels between tyson and jesse owens and adidas is really trying to point out that theyre both humble guys not as big as some sluggers soft spoken
4612623 their running styles arent similar but the quickness of tyson is very reminiscent of the way jesse owens ran and they both wore or are wearing adidas adidas has something really nice there
4612624 hes not a flash in the pan hes a guy who does things right hes in the sport for the long term and so are his sponsors the olympics are just the beginning for him
4612625 i got signed from dundee united to play right back but when the manager asked me to play left back when i first came in i said it was no problem and i felt quite comfortable there
4612626 i went a long period without playing there but the last few pre season games i played a few games at left back but its just the more games you play the more comfortable you get
4612627 i feel now that the seasons started weve started afresh and its whoever has played better or performed better in training that catches the managers eye that is going to play
4612628 i am very very happy to be here im glad to have signed for the club
4612629 i want to do everything i can to repay the faith that the chairman and gaffer jefferies have shown in me
4612630 he impressed us right away in the two or three days that he was with us
4612631 enough to say right weve got some games coming up in pre season well try and get clearance for him to come over and play
4612632 he works extremely hard hes a good talker for someone who has just come into the country he speaks very good english he wants to do really well and sees this as a great opportunity
4612633 the first time i came here i saw this stadium and how close the supporters are to the field they are very near to the pitch almost on the pitch like us
4612634 we have won our first game in the spl and then we must think about the other matches
4612635 we have spoken about st mirren during the week and we know its a hard match for us but we want to continue our good form and win
4612636 i dont think rangers have got the money to afford mcfadden to be honest
4612637 pedro is an experienced player an all round midfielder who can bring a lot to our team
4612638 one of the big things we want to improve on above anything else is our possession of the ball and he will certainly help in this aspect
4612639 he is very good technically can do a bit defensively and can also get goals as well as create them so we hope and believe he will be a very good acquisition for the club
4612640 zale i am boerd i have done everythaing possible what am i to do

4612692 fine fine i guess i know why your doing this
4612693 fine kitty say what want but i know the truth
4612694 if you girls dont mind i need to go out for a bit i like to walk the town around this time
4612695 oh roy just call me eric eric lostern we are more like friends now anyway right
4612696 yeah i guess so what brings you to this area
4612697 your droped this i thought it would be nice to return it
4612698 ahh thank you err i never saw this before but i do lose a lot of items
4612699 thanks elli hay did you see eric i hope he is allright
4612700 sorry ellen i hugged her and she passed out i had no idea that would happen
4612701 yeah if she hadnt have knocked me over i would be dead right now
4612702 it looked like a large spike that was black with purple vains on it it also had smaller spikes extending from it but after elli got off of me in went back in the ground and the hole whare it had been was gone
4612703 geez why did something like that have to show up
4612704 its well the beast is called a shalkon i have no idea why it just was but to the ones who know how they were made call them abomanations they are made from humens shades and thorn beasts
4612705 yeah it has some strange powers and is one of the better made hunters
4612706 well as you saw they strech and can create torns from any place on thair body they are vary strong and can fade into shadows also they can shapeshift and well thiar torns can fire off as needed finally that eye can scan any form of life like a super vison and well they can use magic if they work hard enough
4612707 roy we err the three of us know a lot more they you would think
4612708 yeah roy and the rule is you would have to find out about magic on your own we cant tell you and well you saw that abomanation so your ready to find out about this right
4612709 anyway yes me elli and kitty can use mana or as you call it magic
4612710 i am getting to that you see thare are worlds with other worlds inside of them and the out kinda like our soler system a sun and nine worlds the sun in this case was a world 100 times the size of ours and that world was over flowing with something called mana
4612711 mana is like air in a way only a vary vary small few between worlds can see mana but mana is what allows magic users or as they have come to be called mana users to cast spells
4612712 anyway that large world let its mana out and to the next world under it mana came flowing like a water fall in both the sun or first world and that next one everyone and anythaing can use mana should they wish it but the mana flow didnt stop it only weakend and went on to the next and so on each time the manas power weakend lessing the amount of mana users between worlds and then after it gets though the wolds it flows like a river back to its main sorse making an endless mana flow at the same rate never changing unless an abnomality happens
4612713 wait your new to all this magic mana stuff and your not scared
4612714 not realy i mean i knew thare had to be something bigger then all i could see and what do you know i find it and my three best friends are part of that bigger event i may be useless in that event but yet at least now i can watch it scared a bit knowing that thare is a lot more powerful beings out thare then i could ever hope to see but i am happy to know i am not going to have to sit and be unhappy with my life
4612715 well every mana user is different we each get different spells to cast a lot are the same but well in our world we each get one spell thare another mana user cant cast no matter how cool or simpile it may seem
4612716 ongoing the spell i can cast that elli or kitty cant is a bust attack just a push so powerful it can crack stone
4612717 kitty was a spell i hate it its just a way to control someone it makes someone fall in such deep lover with her that they will do whatever they may ask it is not gender spsicfide so she can control wemon and men alike
4612718 yes and i am really not proud of what i had to do
4612719 fair enough i bet i know what it is anyway
4612720 ugh anyway elli has no spell yet she stoped with her mana use to try and well if you werent so clueless you would know
4612721 allright well thats that we are mana users and now we can start casting again and elli can to since you know now
4612722 that thaing that attacked me and well i cought you sis reading this book here
4612723 start up your pratice again and get batter at being a mana user
4612724 a shalkon i thought they only exist in the first four worlds seeing as to how powerful they are
4612725 thats what i thought to and this kid roy tolken he looks i think i have seen him before but whare
4612726 i think i will keep watch over this group here i dont like whats going on thare thats beast should not have been thare roy is vary lucky that elli girl was thare
4612727 look though my spell books and i need you to find two spells
4612728 one to make a window into thare world so i can see them better and speek with them and i need a gateway spell
4612729 the window i know it will just take some time but a gateway
4612730 yes a gateway i need a way over to world nine if i cant get thare and what i think is going on is that world is doomed and the mana flow may become corrupted
4612731 i will get right one that want the window first
4612732 yes zale now go hurry get the regrents and make that window i must speek with them
4612733 get me a spell for soul veiwing as well and add that to my window spell
4612734 so this is a book showing all sorts of monsters
4612735 ellen cust him off while she is drinking a coke
4612736 oh no thare are meny different beings humenoids thare are nine worlds each one bigger then the one after it so the bigger it is the more can be on it
4612737 shut up yo moron he is the reson mana flows
4612738 thats right my dear and i am hear on important matters
4612739 now that i showed my respect master victor i will show my disrespect for the evil you cause you ego maniacil jerk
4612740 now that hurt my dear ellen but i have no time for that besides for the last hundred years i have been laying off the evil acts and as of two days ago i stoped just to boerd
4612741 its fine i forgive your anger but i am sure you know just as well as i do why i am here

4612745 you ask for time but i know who you shall pick anyway roy was it yes that beast that tried to kill you shouldnt be from your world as ellen seid the power between the powers is stronger depending on how close it is to my world that beasts main home is from the third or fourth world not world nine so as you can see something isnt right
4612746 not that your dumbass the fact that thare is a unbalance a powerful being in a vary weak world

4612753 you seid you were saw something in him but cut it off
4612754 that is roys locked away power for some reson his magic was sealed away in that cage wich that explains his luck and uselessness
4612755 not just powers the mana flowing from that cage rivals mine
4612756 your friend roy is or could be just as powerful as me let me ask i saw his hair covered his left eye what color is that eye
4612757 no well somewhat if he were to crak that cage he could unlock the power and his left eye would open again looking like one of zales just no flames it would burn in mana
4612758 if he can control it yes it would be but he hails from the ninth world and has never even cast a spell if that cage unlocks and his power is free the only way to stop him woul dbe to kill him
4612759 should it come to that i know what we can do
4612760 no this is my dream and i will dream it
4612761 dont be mad humen this is how i get money and youre my next hit
4612762 you know your lord was easy to copy he even let me do it he is the one that put out the hit
4612763 the beast came at roy again but a word was yelled in a a echo of three
4612764 we go shoping for a bit and look what happens
4612765 i didnt do anythaing this thaing just came in here and attacked me
4612766 what the hell as if what isnt enopugh he can split himself into more come on
4612767 you cant blow up a shalkon they multiplie by however meny fragments thare were you have to kill it directly
4612768 maybe maybe not if he is lucky he can unlock his power
4612769 help me please if you dont i am going to die
4612770 why do you want to live so badly you have failed all your life and amount to nothing
4612771 i want to live so i can live for my friends i want to protect them
4612772 i will help you this time roy i want to live to but remember stop looking for help or you will never be able to do what you want to do
4612773 zale get the gateway ready and the vessle body make sure its all prepared roy has gone beserke with power hurry hurry
4612774 go back to your master and tell him if he dosent quit what he is doing he will be killed
4612775 greetings elli ellen and kitty i have been dieing to meet you all in person my name is victor of the mana stream
4612776 he will be fine he is in his new body and is getting taken care of by my student zale who should be here soon we are keeping him asleep untill we are all back over thare i am unsure how he will react to his new body and i am worried it wont be good
4612777 because we still have a few things to do here first off fix this house
4612778 if i may ask you three may i make this my base here in the ninth world it would be vary useful to me
4612779 sure just hurry up i know elli is dieing to see roy
4612780 how could you possabliy understand that when have you ever loved someone and then watched them be torn apart by something abnormol
4612781 humm good point elli no i dont know what thats like but i understand knowing and understanding are two different items child
4612782 please hurry sir i also want to make sure roy is going to be allright but it is important to find out whats going on here
4612783 right and from what i can tell someone like me set up another gateway to get thaings here and back and must be set up all though the worlds because a sholkon of that power only comes from world one or my own but the one from before that you tol dme about could only be from world four or three because had he been that one elli and roy may have died
4612784 i am saying that someone is causeing coruption in the mana stream if that should happen then the problems are unknown
4612785 master your friend is asleep in one of the bed and should wake up in a few hours we should get ready for when he dose

4612814 master bane can show you in fact we should get moveing i will take you to him seeing as to how your friends with a fox you should be able to stay as long as you like
4612815 well i will looking for a silver fox but saveing lives is much higher on the to do list follow me and while your at it give me this story
4612816 your leg is hurt from the fall so piggy back
4612817 no no no no guy is gonna put me on his back and carry me
4612818 ow ow ow ow damn you were right that did hurt
4612819 so why did you say this fox girl here used to be named roy tolken
4612820 nine you say i had no idea you could vist other worlds
4612821 you can as long as someone dies to open the gateway
4612822 oh and let me guess this girls name was roy and she was the one who was killed and her soul was put in the body of this fox girl right
4612823 no rith well you got the killing and soul transerfing all right
4612824 you were right for all the she and her bits
4612825 my name was roy in my world roy is a boys name you get it
4612826 trust me i know the feeling of being in a new body and a herad you yelling about it being bad being a nude fox girl so here put my shirt on
4612827 roy is left speechless but he dose as he was asked after that rith picks him up
4612828 yeah he did got a silver fox and then made me half humen and my fur turned brown like this
4612829 allright then we have a commen enemy anyway i wouldnt be able to question you like this if i did then i would be going aginst a few of my friends who lost thiar bodies to something like this
4612830 yes it is it happened back in my old home i was a freak cause of my wolf eye thats why i have this eye patch and well back then i was deared to go deep into the forest i got distracted shortly after i went in
4612831 fariy yes i played with her for a bit then i ran into a tree and passed out for hours when i woke up i was in a bed and thare was master bane a black fox man whe has long black hair real spikey and he wears well a tunic like mine only white lose cloth pants they were brown and sandles to
4612832 yeah well when i woke up he smiled at me and seid that he had watched me play with the fairy up untill i hit the tree then he took me back to his place to treat my head at the time i thought all foxs eat humens but i was wrong
4612833 and again thats why your in that body you trusted him anyway i gave me a mean and went to sleep in the morning of the following day i saw a fox girl some what that looks like you just her eyes glow red and she was much prettier anyway she was in a cage and was begging me to let her out so
4612834 right i let her out and she went on a rampage the first thaing she did was transform four of my best friends into beasts of this world you will see them when we get to town anyway she attacked my village if it wasnt for bane showing her and traping her in the body of a basic silver fox everyone may have died
4612835 well he is a master of all styles of this world so well it was like a blast that put her in a prisom for a bit then he cast the other spell to trap her in the fox just after he did that though she took off and it has been my duty besides trining to find her and bring her back to fix my friends that was seven years ago when i was 10
4612836 thats a cool story and all but what about the scar
4612837 so they kicked you out cause you let that girl fox out
4612838 you know even though i am stuck like this i amnot all that upset
4612839 if i hadnt have gone into the woods i never would have master bane or the fox people so i guess i can relate

4612862 in mid july the company announced that it had furloughed 45 pilots with an additional 70 plus pilots to be furloughed in september
4612863 managements new rules have left most spirit pilots maxed out on the number of flight hours they can fly under federal law it has also made it nearly impossible for pilots to take on additional flying that would satisfy the number of flights operated by spirit airlines

4612995 that war proved that the enemies of nations live at glass palaces that are instantly breakable when faced with might of nations and their resistance
4612996 the enemies cannot resist in confrontation with a nation whose weapons are
4612997 they must have taken lessons from that event if they are wise enough to do so
4612998 the wretched and mean israeli figures had better realize that constant and everyday threatening of iran would lead them nowhere since such threats are both outdated and ineffective
4612999 is there any necessity under the current conditions of the country for some of our executive officials to speak of friendship with the israeli nation and to add that the american nation are the top most people in the field of mass communications
4613000 principally this is an incorrect claim since we do not recognize a people called the israeli nation being certain that the only nation living in occupied lands is the palestinian nation besides those are the people of israel that back up their government the entire people of israel are the militia force for the israeli government i e they are commissioned with the task of assisting their government upon outbreak of any war
4613001 under such conditions why should someone here say we are friends of the israeli people never we neither recognize the legitimacy of the occupier regime of holy qods nor are friends of the people of israel
4613002 since this comment has had wrong international reflection the person that has uttered it must immediately take back his words and to beg the great iranian nation to pardon him for this inappropriate stand taking rather than saying that i would repeat it thousand times repeating a mistake a thousand times equals making a thousand mistakes what kind of reasoning is that
4613003 the islamic systems policies and fundamentals are clear no single member of this mature nation permits anyone to say a word against fundamentals of foreign policy defined by the late imam khomeini p and the leader of the revolution in the capacity of an official of the system
4613004 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4613005 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4613006 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4613007 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4613008 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4613009 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4613010 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4613011 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4613012 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4613013 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4613014 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4613015 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4613016 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4613017 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4613018 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4613019 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4613020 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4613021 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4613022 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4613023 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4613024 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4613025 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4613026 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4613027 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined

4613066 by kevin walker cliff ferguson and paul denvir continuum publishing group 2000 for those who prefer a structured analytical approach this is the book for you the authors effectively cover all key aspects of business development for professionals virtually all of which apply to lawyers but do so in a step by step manner some of the strongest chapters discuss building a pipeline and intelligently allocating time to different categories of existing and potential clients the book is devoid of any self help or motivational pitches it closely adheres to sound business principles rain making attract new clients no matter what your field

4613070 you have to have a business sense to become a virtual paralegal you need the practical experience
4613071 so many dont belong to our organization or theyre doing the work of a virtual assistant but they dont even know theres a name for what they do
4613072 a virtual legal assistant is available whenever the workload is heavy enough to justify it but in slow times there is no need to worry about layoffs or high salaries
4613073 it is challenging convincing lawyers that they can trust staff or virtual contractors to get the work done to do a great job and yet not be under their eagle eyes
4613074 law firms often arent comfortable with technology so that is another challenge getting them familiar with the tools that make virtual partnerships work
4613075 from a level of standardization and comfort i dont think theyll take over the profession
4613076 they will augment and fill niches of the market i can see both sides of the coin virtual paralegals can be very beneficial to a law practice for a case that requires a lot of resources

4613090 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book

4613094 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4613095 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4613096 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4613097 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4613098 the accusations were false and he wasnt doing anything illegal
4613099 i believe that perhaps that he felt he might be doing be doing something wrong to his family and i think thats a personal issue between him and his family
4613100 im not real comfortable commenting on the things that she was doing but lets just say that what she was doing would have certainly enticed any man to look into that window
4613101 that just makes me super angry and mad i didnt walk his hand i didnt make him come there
4613102 i figured if i gave in that he would leave me alone after that if i gave him what he wanted i just didnt know what else to do i was totally frustrated i was scared i was mad
4613103 you know the interesting thing is the reality is the marginal profit of the oil energy industry in america today is 8 which is modest compared to insurance for example insurance companies or banks or other industries
4613104 but because prices are soaring the reality is the federal government is raking in a bunch of cash right now on the backs of energy producers so thats one part of the equation that people seem to be missing right now
4613105 you look at the tax payments that are being made right now by the major oil companies and the month to month increase that youve seen over the last several months the amount of income the federal government is raking in right now is enormous
4613106 the entire bill is predicated on a 48 billion tax increase on the energy production in america
4613107 the bottom line is that bob schaffer would rather let colorado families and businesses continue to suffer than see a dime taken away from the oil companies
4613108 it couldnt be a clearer display of his true priorities
4613109 the second unlockable for the heavy natascha allows the heavy to slow enemies with her bullets enemies taking damage from her will find themselves moving slower for an instant encouraging them to find cover or deal with the heavy unfortunately her firepower is somewhat weaker than that of sasha so the heavy will find it takes longer to finish them off as a result nataschas great to use against those that want to get away like scouts amp medics and not so great against those trying to kill you heavies that like to jump around corners to surprise groups of enemies will also find it very useful although its best to make sure there isnt a sasha wielding heavy there
4613110 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4613111 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4613112 we know that asthma prevalence is higher among boys than girls but that the condition later in life is more prevalent in women than men
4613113 this study is particularly exciting as it provides an insight into the mechanisms involved in asthma development during the transition period between childhood and adulthood demonstrating how we can influence these processes and develop new targeted therapies

4613125 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4613126 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4613127 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4613128 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4613129 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4613132 weve got to narrow it down on who we are going to work with getting ready for louisville
4613133 the following scrimmage will be going against some stuff that we think louisville might be doing on both sides of the ball this is totally about evaluating where we are at each position and whos ready to play and who still needs some work and that type of thing
4613134 the major evaluation is going to happen tomorrow we have drills and all these different things going on and are working on fundamentals and theyre a little leg weary so i dont expect it to be as crisp as it could be but i want to see effort and execution
4613135 there will be a few guys that probably wont be able to participate and a few others that will only be able to participate on a limited scale and limited reps but not a lot
4613136 i wont know that until tomorrow morning some fo the guys came out and did some individual drills today but well just see how their injuries respond they didnt do a lot of the team work but if they can go then theyll go i really wont know until i get the word from the medical people in the morning
4613137 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different

4613142 he emerges not as a remote figure to be admired or despised from afar but as someone we can readily understand a rumbustious enthusiast given to occasional bouts of depression a practical joker an affectionate husband and father a preacher of thundering oratory a man who enjoyed life and was certainly no puritanical killjoy luther possessed the faults that mirrored his virtues stubbornness to match courage vulgarity to match humanity impatience with others to match his own self discipline generosity which matched his own indifference to creature comforts a warm heart for friends which matched his unflagging hostility towards his opponents to get to know this man is a rewarding experience

4613214 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link
4613215 sternberg in press found that analytical tests of the kind traditionally used to measure so called general abilities tend rather strongly to favor americans of european and asian origin but tests of creative and practical thinking show quite different patterns we also know that there is a substantial genetic influence contributing to individual differences in levels of academic achievement luo thompson amp detterman 2003 yet we do not know a single gene that has been identified as contributing to either academic achievement or iq thus the statement that racial differences in iq or academic achievement are of genetic origin is when all is said and done a leap of imagination the literature on intelligence race and genetics constitutes in large part leaps of imagination to justify post hoc social stratifications there is nothing wrong in principle with people expressing their views on social policy but they need to recognize these views for what they are social policy pronouncements not science

4613329 it was exactly two weeks ago this afternoon that by a one vote margin we saw speaker pelosi adjourn the house denying members the opportunity to have a vote or even speak about the need for us to do everything that we can to reduce energy prices

4613365 i really think he is the most qualified democrat in the race for president
4613366 his track record is exceptional hes done a fine job as governor and was re elected with around 70 percent of the vote
4613367 if a democrat carries new mexico colorado and nevada we dont need ohio or florida to win richardson is very popular throughout the southwest and stands the best chance of being able to do that
4613368 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry

4613379 the republican drill only plan would lower oil prices by only 2 cents a gallon over ten years
4613380 instead releasing some oil from the government stockpile will reduce consumer prices in ten days not ten years
4613381 peter beutel an analyst with energy risk management firm cameron hanover downplayed the impact that obamas spr release would have on oil prices
4613382 a responsible domestic drilling program means a requirement that big oil drill the oil leases they already own
4613383 and nearly 90 million acres of public land are already open for drilling and a bipartisan majority of congress supports telling big oil to use it or lose it before getting more leases
4613384 but the alternatives the democrats are attempting to push through congress are an incoherent mish mash one dubbed use it or lose it would oblige oil firms to exploit their existing leases more quickly or see them revert to the government the hitch is that federal leases already work along those lines and few imagine that oil firms are deliberately ignoring vast pools of oil given the current high price
4613385 pelosi firm no vote on offshore drilling house speaker nancy pelosi on sunday ruled out a vote on new offshore oil drilling even as democratic presidential candidate barack obama said he might be open to a compromise that included it

4613408 this is a situation that could easily have turned into a major gun battle
4613409 it was plain old dumb luck that nobody got hurt including you mr gorbey
4613410 the danger is mr gorbey genuinely believes that he is the subject of a conspiracy
4613411 in his mind the conspiracy is even bigger than it once was now that he is about to be sentenced
4613412 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4613413 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4613414 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4613415 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4613416 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4613417 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4613418 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4613419 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4613420 we have staked our claim its use it or lose it for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north
4613421 saat itu kejadiannya masih beristri bambang dengan halimah agustina kamil mungkin karena itu kali yang membedakan semuanya
4613422 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4613423 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4613424 i fully document all arguments and contentions i make extensively footnoting all references
4613425 my fundamental opposition to obamas presidential candidacy involves public policy differences
4613426 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4613427 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4613428 ik ben heel blij dat er nu eindelijk iets aan gebeurt
4613429 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4613430 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon till that day
4613431 all my cupboard doors flew open and the whole house shook it was unreal i cant believe it
4613432 it was quite severe i experienced the dudley one and this was more severe
4613433 i went outside to see if the roof had collapsed i could see the furniture in the room moving it was like it was on a jelly mould
4613434 i have never felt one as strong as that one before i was in my sitting room and the grandfather clock was rattling rather violently
4613435 it was very strong i felt the whole room moving
4613436 is added to the n series you can keep the exposure in a dark situation night time or indoor as long as you wish it gives the picture a sense of motion the holga is now sort of a pinhole camera detailed instruction is in the menu
4613437 there were an easy three other teams that made me offers on offer sheets
4613438 it was mostly tony why i signed obviously i saw the shop i saw the backbone the foundation that haas had laid with their efforts you know talking to tony and his people it seemed to be the best decision for the right reasons
4613439 thats what it was all about i always said i was fortunate having options to have that option to go to what i thought was the best place to do the best thing for me and my long term goals when tonys situation came to light and those things became more public it was easier to understand those things for me
4613440 obviously hes a super technical person and has obviously a huge influence at stewart haas with respect to the race cars
4613441 the alleged video scandal of pinoy big brother teen edition matt evans is it really him you be the judge
4613442 di siya tulad ng iba diyan kay sarah dapat seryoso ka talaga
4613443 thousands of young spaniards come here at night laden with huge containers of vodka whisky and beers get drunk and go on the rampage committing all sorts of acts of vandalism
4613444 when it gets cold at night they go so far as to make bonfires
4613445 i asked for a similar law to the one in andalusia
4613446 i see the mayors problem but i would never make such a direct accusation against a particular nation especially from countries where we mount costly publicity campaigns urging them to visit
4613447 every other day our municipal cleaners have to clear up debris left by spaniards in an alcoholic coma i worry about the cultural education of these youngsters who cant enjoy themselves without getting out of their heads with drink
4613448 its an affront to holidaymakers who come to rest and enjoy the beach when around 2 000 spaniards hit our beach at weekends its impossible for the towns two policemen on night duty to control them
4613449 everything worked fairly well together the car was extremely tight and peter sospenzo crew chief and the guys made some changes and made it better thats something i hadnt seen in weeks its been pretty cool
4613450 michaels been great hes like everybody else he wants some help i dont have a magic wand or anything i cant come in here and fix the world but i can give them feedback and maybe theyll listen to me and thats what michael waltrip wanted me to do so here we are
4613451 hes just trying to help out and give us as much information as he can
4613452 its different to have a veteran guy in there saying hey its doing this than it is a rookie guy and its got nothing to do with my ability or my feedback hes got credibility because hes been doing it for so long and done so many races
4613453 it instantly helps the team understand whats going on as much as i hate being out im also excited about seeing what our cars are capable of doing and if theres a position where we can better ourselves im all for it
4613454 michael waltrip racing is committed to putting me back in the car and committed to building for 09
4613455 in my eyes its just a matter of learning as much as i can

4613459 we cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun his is no more humane while his education has been sadly neglected
4613460 i welcome the announcement that the united states and poland have agreed on a missile defense plan for europe
4613461 it was a near perfect laboratory test sen obama flunked
4613462 the claim wrongly implies that mccain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies he is not
4613463 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers
4613464 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4613465 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4613466 it was a near perfect laboratory test sen obama flunked
4613467 the claim wrongly implies that mccain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies he is not
4613468 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers
4613469 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4613470 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4613471 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4613472 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4613473 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4613474 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4613475 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4613476 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4613477 in this film we will be exposing the mystification of sioux falls sd
4613478 i remember when i didnt even know what mystical was then mystic chi lightonious came to town and boy things sure got mystical after that
4613479 so one night mystic chi invites me over explaining that i have a high frequency a potential to teach me the art of tantric sexual yoga after hours of resisting reaching climax entering higher dimensions of existence it happened ive never came so much in my whole life that guy is fuckin mystic
4613480 everywhere he and his mystic posse went people were offering gifts and flowers to them kneeling at their feet praying for blessings and healings and thats when things started to go to his head m chi
4613481 and just when life couldnt get any better for mystic chi another mystic appeared on the scene a younger more handsome mystic mystic jeffrey played by matthew mcfarland and things took a turn for the worse
4613482 what im not happy about is that russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement
4613483 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4613484 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4613485 i think it speaks wonderfully and gloriously for the indian film industry
4613486 its very heartening to know that indian films are viewed in all these places and its wonderful to know that you reach out to so many people and they appreciate your work
4613487 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4613488 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4613489 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4613490 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4613491 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4613492 first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
4613493 if i give a request to my programming group i will have results in about n weeks
4613494 then at a february event at california college of the arts
4613495 in conversation with ann hatch and others the question of the houses fate again came up it was then a couple of weeks away from being put on the market she asked if id like to come and see it so the next day ann showed me through the house my jaw dropped as i walked through i realized that this is an amazing place
4613496 i knew if it went on the market a developer would come and snap it up
4613497 as both davids longtime friend and as his appointed art executor will be to work closely with david to create an inventory of his artwork and domestic possessions that will be gifted to carlies new nonprofit entity once it is legally established for many artists who came of age in san francisco during the 1970s and 1980s davids home and all that creatively and socially transpired within it came to be considered a genuine masterpiece of contemporary art
4613498 my hope is that any work related to the house comes back to the house
4613499 there are some works created out of a relationship with david so there will be a few works incorporated by other artists that are directly related to the house
4613500 essentially the house has been an ever evolving installation a hybrid between a home studio museum and artwork
4613501 this evolution has been well documented photographically and i propose to gather the photographs of the house and accompany them with an essay detailing the history of the house and how irelands approach to it has influenced not only his own future work but also that of may prominent artists today
4613502 i am sure every historian archeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4613503 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4613504 i am fully convinced that this was a supernatural occurrence it is something i have believed to see in my ministry and am overjoyed that it happened it happened in such a way that my ministry was not at all associated with it which left local volunteers and non christians marveling at what had happened
4613505 the reported incident which if true is a miracle nearly unheard of in modern times occurred during hickeys citywide leaders conference in may attended by nearly 10 000 pastors and local leaders from curious muslims to orthodox coptic christians
4613506 the boxes were given out leaving none in the room
4613507 after the food was completely distributed and after the crowd swelled to about 5 000 hickey said volunteers were astonished to return to what shouldve been a room of empty tables to discover 1 200 more lunches she said after they handed out the mysterious extras another 1 200 appeared leaving a surplus of food and dumbfounded witnesses
4613508 i am fully convinced that this was a supernatural occurrence
4613509 it is something i have believed to see in my ministry and am overjoyed that it happened it happened in such a way that my ministry was not at all associated with it which left local volunteers and non christians marveling at what had happened

4613511 despite his recent pontifications about fiscal frugality rumors of bankruptcy in his past continue to shadow him
4613512 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4613513 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4613514 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4613515 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4613516 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4613517 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4613518 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4613519 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4613520 what im not happy about is that russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement

4613529 from day one my partner and i have been thinking whats coming next
4613530 we owned the rights to sell their music digitally but there was no place to sell it we had to wait for the market to mature
4613531 we supply music to just about every isp like itunes napster zune every place that digital music is sold at retail were dealing with most of the mobiles
4613532 i think music will come to people in a way that feels like a free way
4613533 they could find no way to continue consumption and derive revenue so they started this ridiculous sue your audience stuff your customers the fans theyre the lifeblood of the industry i wont call it piracy i wont say it was stolen i will say it was appropriated
4613534 but i think you are going to find that a lot of music sells more if you give it away free first
4613535 the business was always controlled by a small group of people
4613536 how things were done was a secret how you made records and how you manufactured them and once you got them how are you going to get them to the people
4613537 the internet took control away the one element the industry could always control was distribution
4613538 the brand is the artist as in the old days you have to find a way to speak to the audience with digital there is the opportunity to identify what people want and give it to them instead of the broad spectrum we had to attack with radio in the old days now you can get down to reach that audience without having to worry about the whole country
4613539 i guess the difference is the record companies look at this as the end of something i see the beginning of something i dont see the end of anything
4613540 its an opportunity for more greatness from the industry that has been so good to me all my life plus im still looking for that next hit
4613541 twitter has made this reclusive phase of my life all the more bearable
4613542 twitter makes me more colorful without it im just a two toned productive pill who wants that not me

4613557 has the not honey drizzled on my head and the bees not spat upon the ground and the bones of oxen not been thrown into the barbeque long enough
4613558 the strawberries of the field and the mascadines of the woodlands are stored up in a great vessel by the lord for me but the lord hath shut them out 17 how dost thou unlock the great bounty stored up by the mighty one
4613559 o amelia are the lilies of the field not want of rain and art thou not want of screw
4613560 the holy mother hath granted use of her screw but behold
4613561 verily every man hath defied my will like this clot of cork with much effort amelia shall remove it but not without the help and grace of my mighty pliers and the shedding of much wine upon her face 23 for the lord doth sacrifice himself

4613571 if youre on a fat loss program it can mean the difference between getting great results and getting zero results

4613679 this help is badly needed it has been a challenging year for new yorks farmers who are the backbone of our upstate new york economy
4613680 i am pleased that the usda has acknowledged our need for assistance during this difficult growing season providing our farmers with the opportunity to apply for emergency loans if we can help our farmers withstand the financial hardships associated with these difficult weather conditions we can help preserve upstate new yorks important agricultural future
4613681 this is great news for new york farmers who suffered the brunt of the hail storm this past summer
4613682 this federal aid will go a long way toward giving new yorks farmers the assistance they need after this devastating storm
4613683 this shows that the state and the u s department of agriculture recognize the impact that adverse weather like what weve seen in recent months has had on the farms that play such an important role in our local economy this is why i asked commissioner hooker to tour damaged onion farms with me late last month to inform farmers that they need to report damage to their local fsa now the farmers who reported the damage will be eligible for low interest loans and this will help especially if they can use these loans to shave a couple of interest points off some of their debt moving forward
4613684 i am pleased the u s department of agriculture could come through for farmers in our region
4613685 hail and damaging winds have devastated some crops in our region and the overall growing season has been difficult with so much rain though their profits may be lost perhaps now theyll be able to recoup some of their crop investments which will help next spring to hopefully keep them in business i will also advocate with the governors office and the u s secretary of agriculture to provide further assistance for crops damaged in july and august
4613686 so did you know the snake was there or were you reaching down into some brush and stuff in your yard

4613708 as far as single pieces this is one of the heaviest single pieces the port has ever received
4613709 this is a testament to the efficiency and safe handling tactics of our longshoremen
4613710 the trailer that it will be housed on has 114 tires

4613714 hes a tremendous athlete and this is his 18th season thats some great experience there

4613716 it is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation the higher it is the harder it is flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard he is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months

4613719 the document signed on aug 31 2006 between mehmet karasu representing akademi ofset and aban di li did not have anything to do with a bribe this was an agreement between me and akademi ofset of which i was previously an associate for safeguarding my savings that i had put in an earmarked account at a bank to make sure akademi ofset could obtain credit from that bank
4613720 a similar tactic was used by chp samsun deputy haluk ko in the past
4613721 k l daro lu is fulfilling his post of chp parliamentary group deputy chairman very successfully we dont take him seriously a politician cannot fulfill his task of opposition by attacking others and accusing other people of corruption and bribery k l daro lu is constantly accusing somebody with groundless claims he previously directed accusations at president abdullah g l the turkish armed forces tsk and the general staff he is this time accusing mr di li of bribery
4613722 his real surname was karabulut and he comes from a family that resisted the proclamation of the republic k l daro lu changed his surname in 1966 to conceal his family roots
4613723 though these people were banned from serving in state institutions throughout their lives due to membership in a terrorist organization k l daro lu employed them in critical positions in the sgk
4613724 the visit showed that turkish iranian relations need to be reinterpreted compared to the period before the visit turkish officials will now be able to see more clearly where the boundaries of cooperation with iran end
4613725 a clear outcome of the visit is that the relations are based on security and economy there is no real partnership in politics or other areas
4613726 that means cooperation in the military arena is also nonexistent
4613727 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4613728 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4613729 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4613730 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4613731 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4613732 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4613733 four thousand hectares were destroyed in antalyas serik and manavgat districts there were also big fires in anakkale zmir and mersin provinces we were able to put out those fires quickly with the tremendous efforts made by firefighters
4613734 thirty three thousand hectares were scorched during 2007 however other mediterranean countries witnessed five to 10 times more fires for example 270 000 300 000 hectares of land were decimated by fire in greece spain and italy we are very successful in terms of firefighting compared to those countries but we must be more successful to this end we will organize a large meeting in antalya on forest fires in november or december there we will meet with forestry experts particularly those specializing in the study of forest fires from universities companies producing firefighting vehicles and equipment citizens and civil society organizations to discuss what we have done and need to do in the future the education of citizens on forest fires is of great importance we will also talk about purchasing land vehicles and aircraft for firefighting
4613735 apart from these we lease firefighting planes and helicopters particularly from abroad
4613736 for this reason we have begun to work on forming an air fleet in order to fight fires more effectively upon the order of prime minister recep tayyip erdo an of course this cannot be done overnight it is not easy to acquire firefighting planes as they are in such high demand it requires time to produce them there are only a few factories that manufacture such planes it is not an easy task to form an air fleet yet we will do it
4613737 now experts are working to determine which kinds of trees to plant on the affected areas
4613738 the decision was taken to enable citizens of the turkish republic to attend the sept 6 game between the football teams of armenia and turkey to be played in yerevan
4613739 for sporting events the parties involved often provide such temporary implementations if this decision by yerevan was actually made this is not an extraordinary action that hasnt been seen before
4613740 a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4613741 yes i heard about it and i was very saddened
4613742 unfortunately in turkey we have always made arguments about the subject on a conspiratorial platform in fact the debates and conspiracies about the sabbateans never end but in times of great turmoil and changes such as the early years of the republican era and the last decade they increase short and seemingly easy conspiratorial solutions to the problem were wholeheartedly embraced by the masses marginal groups and those who were left outside of the ongoing changes
4613743 turkay nefes at the university of kent is doing his doctoral work specifically on this very relation between sabbateanism and conspiracy theories and i am sure that we will learn more about the meaning of this notorious relationship
4613744 sabbateanism is as close to judaism as christianity is they diverge in their belief on the coming of the messiah the backbone of judaism is the anticipation of the messiahs first coming but like christianity the backbone of sabbatean theology is the anticipation of the second coming of the messiah
4613745 zionist historians have accepted him as the beginning of the zionist movement and jewish nationalism since he also mentioned the promised land and visited it himself
4613746 you have a messiah and you believe that he is right in every circumstance a very limited minority thought like this and converted to islam they of course did not drop all their beliefs overnight but developed a syncretic and eclectic belief and praxis system which included judaism islam kabbala and sufism over time the islamic and turkish dimensions of the sabbatean identity gained ascendancy as the community members forgot the jewish language disconnected with the jewish community and mingled with the larger surrounding society however the clouds of suspicion about the veracity of their true islamic identity were never dispersed
4613747 however their idiosyncratic identity was not a great mystery rather it was an open secret the ottoman multi religious and cosmopolitan culture tolerated these sorts of identities including crypto jews crypto christians and heterodox bekta is in the midst of turkish communities after the 19th century the mystical secrets of the community faded away since there were no sabbateans who fully knew the sabbatean kabbalah and could really interpret the texts
4613748 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4613749 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4613750 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4613751 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4613752 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4613753 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4613754 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4613755 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4613756 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances
4613757 but bush said moscows decision to send in troops had hurt its credibility overseas bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4613758 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkahzia and south ossetia
4613759 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible
4613760 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible
4613761 as you know issues such as natural gas and petroleum require investment and talks on these issues may take a long time
4613762 steve hadley the us national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4613763 the attitude was weve allowed them to host iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4613764 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the un security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4613765 they do not want countries like iran and turkey to develop
4613766 relations between turkey and iran have deep roots we consider turkeys progress to be our own and we know the turkish people have similar sentiments for us
4613767 turkish iranian cooperation could generate a great force the cooperation of the two countries is very important for the world and for regional peace
4613768 it is not possible for the united states which even failed to protect its ally georgia to attack iran the us could not even protect its own ally us clout in world politics is decreasing moreover it is in a major economic depression
4613769 we will see that the us empire will crack and eventually collapse there is nothing that the us can do against iran
4613770 a base for reaching an agreement over the iranian nuclear issue
4613771 there is no compromise that we will make their hands are empty they cant even protect georgia
4613772 the united states will soon leave the region then regional countries should fill the security vacuum there is no need for the interference of other countries
4613773 i have never said such a thing i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to leave iraq soon
4613774 it is not possible to get involved in other problems in the middle east as long as this problem is not solved one should look at where this regime is coming from we are not anti semitic or enemies of jews as a matter of fact zionists are not jews either they are irreligious and atheists
4613775 there was no talk of it they silently destroyed those guys
4613776 the three of them used to eat from the same bowl at the time
4613777 i had heard at the time that there were fraudulent operations to render a potentially solid bank completely dysfunctional some admitted they had made a mistake in this regard
4613778 the people i represent are not a happy about ukurova
4613779 thanks to history and geography turkey serves as a way station between continents and cultures but not all the people who transit through that country see it in such a romantic way tens of thousands of illegal migrants are thought to cross turkey every year
4613780 there is pressure on turkey an aspiring european union member to curb the twin evils of smuggling and trafficking results are mixed the harsh terrain dividing turkey from iran and iraq from where most illegal migrants sneak in is hard to control so too is corruption
4613781 as for trafficking the picture is brighter recent data suggest a drop in the number of foreigners trafficked to turkey to provide sex
4613782 we were not looking for bigfoot we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
4613783 i didnt believe in bigfoot at the time but youve got to come to terms with it and realize youve got something special and thats what it was
4613784 it seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax
4613785 we still have a corpse we just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend
4613786 ill tell you what ive seen and what ive touched and what ive felt what ive prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide ok
4613787 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4613788 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4613789 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4613790 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4613791 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4613792 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4613793 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4613794 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4613795 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4613796 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4613797 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
4613798 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
4613799 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
4613800 america is in great difficulty and we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others
4613801 i wish i could get approved for an auto loan
4613802 dmx was picked up yesterday in florida over a bench warrant issued against him in arizona florida lawyer brad cohen tried to bail him out today but couldnt because arizona courts list him as having a no bail hold x was listed as having 25 000 cash bond but somehow its changed
4613803 so now the rapper has to sit in a florida jail until his october 2 court hearing for a possession charge he has in miami cohen told us hell have him out before then if they can straighten everything out

4613806 how did we get here seriously what is going on
4613807 i grew up listening to a lot of 60s folk music and musicals
4613808 this campaign is a continuation of the work we already do absolutely there is help for them older people should not feel alone we are always here for them we offer a number of services ranging from prevention through to sign posting for people who are worried about mental health issues we do that through an information and advice service
4613809 lots of older people go through depression without knowing it one of the worst things for depression among older people is loneliness this is why were so concerned about people left alone in their own homes depression is a far more serious illness than people give it credit for it destroys some peoples lives
4613810 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4613811 want to feel like okay its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama
4613812 feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
4613813 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states
4613814 the one thing you really have to do as a nominee is establish your dominance over the party
4613815 people want to see the presidential nominee controlling the convention
4613816 in the interest of being gracious and avoiding the alienation of the clinton people they basically folded
4613817 reluctantly conceded it was safer than having these people walk away from denver disgruntled
4613818 obama showed that he is a leader who unites the democratic party by recognising hillarys accomplishments in this historic race
4613819 former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4613820 lord if it be your will please protect me whatever your will though i love you and trust you amen
4613821 well i guess the lord isnt going to help me out of this one
4613822 what i need is a brick wall and what the lord has sent me is a spider web god does have a sense of humor
4613823 i had forgotten that in you a spiders web is stronger than a brick wall
4613824 he had been given a strong faith through his parents
4613825 as an adult in his teen years and early college he kind of got away from the church and ended up going to st johns university in minnesota tom was very intellectual enjoyed the discourse with monks had a lot of questions and i think the monks provided a great insight into the faith he had grown up with and somehow had been missing
4613826 ive often thought about the prayers he must have said on that airplane and i think that he was praying to the virgin mary
4613827 i think that his last prayer would have been a hail mary
4613828 he would often bring up his faith in god and never shied away from conversations about it
4613829 he had some kind of meeting in france coming up and he was trying to talk his dad into going with him so that they could visit lourdes
4613830 after our third daughter was born i always had this feeling that tom was not going to live long enough to raise our children but i never talked to him about this
4613831 i shared that thought with my mom right after our third daughter was born
4613832 my mother asked me what i was talking about i dont know why i said that but i remember feeling an incredible sense of peace that whatever happened everything was going to be okay it was the week of february 24 1998 and i also told her then that he was going to be killed in a plane crash it just came out of my mouth without any thought and i didnt even think of it after i said it it was something i was very much at peace with it was gods plan preparing me
4613833 i was a little bit surprised but i didnt say anything
4613834 he said i feel like god is calling me to do something and i dont know what it is
4613835 but to say he was intuitive is an understatement and i knew if he felt something was going to happen i better listen to it and trust him one of the things we brainstormed about was that he thought it had something to do with the white house
4613836 that seemed like the avenue that god was calling him for
4613837 but something about that didnt feel right so he continued praying and we continued with our conversations from time to time about what he thought gods plan was
4613838 it was a serious conversation we knew that we had to be prepared he went out the next day and tried to double the life insurance on both of us this was the september before he was able to double mine but not his because he had been diagnosed with sleep apnea earlier that year long story short we just proceeded with living our lives and dreaming our dreams and working toward our goals but having an over riding fear that something was going to happen to one of us my feeling was that it was going to be tom and toms feeling was that it was going to be him he just felt that whatever gods plan was for him it had something to do with the white house and was going to impact a lot of people
4613839 no im not im on an airplane that has been hijacked
4613840 we have to do something im putting a plan together
4613841 we cant wait for the authorities i dont know what they could do anyway its up to us i think we can do it
4613842 the two of us were calm eerily calm i knew that no matter what happened that everything was going to be okay i remember after hanging up the phone after each conversation with him just saying the same prayer i asked god to hold him in the palms of his hands i prayed for strength for all of us and the endurance to do gods will
4613843 i know that he motivated those people aboard that flight to do what they did
4613844 and i also know that had he not been on the plane that circumstances would have been very different today
4613845 dire public health dangers of leaks or terrorist attacks make this site clearly and completely unacceptable
4613846 she was a distinguished scientist and might have been able to get to plum island as a researcher
4613847 we have looked at partners for a lot of things and we are going to continue to do that for the best business model

4613854 adem s como todos los dem s estudios seguimos sintiendo las repercusiones de la huelga de escritores que impact la entrega de los guiones de otras pel culas cambiando totalmente el escenario competitivo de 2009 y abriendo nuevos espacios de oportunidad que queremos aprovechar as acordamos que la mejor estrategia era mover el misterio del pr ncipe a julio y con ello llenar perfectamente el hueco que podr a haber a la mitad del verano

4613861 there were no crops or planting of any nature rather the cutting down of timber far exceeded the originally authorized 201 hectares we also saw landfill obstruction affecting 10 ditches and drainage channels with decaying vegetation and other pollutants protected tree species such as cedar saquisaqui drago and araguaney were also torn down
4613862 the regional environmental director had prior knowledge of clear inconsistencies and still went ahead for this reason the commission decided to formally request nunez dismissal because of his proven involvement in illegal acts that undermine the interests of the venezuelan state
4613863 legal action must also be taken to ensure the safety of this important natural reservoir
4613864 otherwise the responsibility lies with the commander of army operations theater to 5 brigadier general jose gregorio montilla pantoja
4613865 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and analysed airway responsiveness ar
4613866 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4613867 there is one focus and it is that this matter must be resolved
4613868 energy exploration would be limited to a small 2 000 acre lot with in anwr
4613869 comparable to a postage stamp sitting on a football field
4613870 visiting anwr revealed that almost no wildlife exists in the 2 000 acre area
4613871 caribou and wildlife were nowhere near the possible drilling sites
4613872 energy production would be limited to a small 2 000 acre lot within anwr an area comparable to a postage stamp on a football field
4613873 an area comparable to a postage stamp on a football field
4613874 visiting anwr revealed that almost no wildlife exists in the 2 000 acre area

4613878 13 things i meant to write about but never did
4613879 we have crews engaged to deliver supplies to those in need and others on standby ready to go at a moments notice if called upon to go in and provide relief
4613880 weve been called on to provide relief before air mobility is a unique asset for our nation
4613881 our airlift capability also allowed our nation to keep its promise to georgia
4613882 when georgia needed its troops at home we were able to quickly provide the lift to get them there

4613884 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4613885 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4613886 i heard an explosion it sounded kind of loud and it reverberated
4613887 it was rather scary i walked outside meandered down half asleep and didnt see anything
4613888 i knew it wasnt a gunshot so it had to be a transformer
4613889 nothing in our reports indicates an explosion from our equipment
4613890 its really comfortable i feel like im being productive at work and getting some exercise
4613891 we find people are more engaged and we find that were more engaged when were not just sitting at our desks
4613892 one minute you can work on very important assignment and the next minute go challenge them in a game of wii tennis it really building camaraderie and team work
4613893 you arent the underdogs if you can beat france twice
4613894 i like what i see when i look to my left and when i look to my right
4613895 the more reps i take at center the more comfortable i become thats good i want quarterback carson palmer to feel comfortable too
4613896 youve got to temper the testosterone a little bit on that one
4613897 you look at it and its huge and all that but playing center is not something you all of a sudden just do to me today was just another day in training camp working on options
4613898 i think thats unstoppable personally with regard to the run and having rudi johnson and chris perry back there
4613899 i feel they can go for 150 yards every game with that line thats a lot of meat in there
4613900 if im going to vegas im not betting on that
4613901 given that theres the investigation and the obvious impact of the explosion its fairly obvious to anyone that thats not going to take place
4613902 as i tiptoed gingerly on my four year old toes over the drop off at the lake curious to see how far out i could venture
4613903 it was hugh who hauled me out and onto the raft when i was suddenly out of my depth
4613904 ran pell mell down a steep hill in montreal to catch up to a runaway stroller containing a friends child just before it would have smashed into lanes of oncoming traffic
4613905 a model supervisor always ready to talk always full of helpful guidance suggestions and references
4613906 he touched many students who went on to produce outstanding work mary nyquist jeanne shami gordon teskey anthony raspa immediately come to mind
4613907 this was a huge personal tragedy for him and for all of us
4613908 he strove very hard to overcome that personal loss and put the whole thing in perspective and to go on teaching and being a father and a good husband and all the rest of it
4613909 porque jehov es nuestro juez jehov es nuestro legislador jehov es nuestro rey l mismo nos salvar
4613910 el justo no ser removido jam s pero los imp os no habitar n la tierra
4613911 mas t cuando ores entra en tu aposento y cerrada la puerta ora a tu padre que est en secreto y tu padre que ve en lo secreto te recompensar en p blico
4613912 si su majestad se pone hoy al servicio de este pueblo respondieron ellos y condesciende con ellos y les responde con amabilidad ellos le servir n para siempre
4613913 si mi padre les impuso un yugo pesado yo les aumentar la carga si l los castigaba a ustedes con una vara yo lo har con un l tigo
4613914 el hijo del hombre no vino para que le sirvan sino para servir y para dar su vida en rescate por muchos
4613915 you win some you lose some and some get rained out but you gotta suit up for them all
4613916 the bend in the road is not the end of the road unless you refuse to take the turn
4613917 listen to the exhortation of the dawn look to this day for it is life the very life of life in its brief course lie all the verities and realities of your existence the bliss of growth the glory of action the splendor of beauty for yesterday is but a dream and tomorrow is only a vision but today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope look well therefore to this day such is the salutation of the dawn
4613918 dont blame it on rio the real deal behind why men go to brazil for sex
4613919 road less traveled two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i kept the first for another day yet knowing how way leads onto way i doubted if i should ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
4613920 live each season as it passes breathe the air drink the drink taste the fruit and resign yourself to the influences of each
4613921 most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all
4613922 the difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the worlds problems
4613923 a sic como o ver o a esta o mais desejada
4613924 the authentication point was unable to process this saml assertion
4613925 this has come out of a little bit of communication with the media about how animals fare in this current climate and recession
4613926 for a lot of people it is becoming harder and harder for them to manage their animals one thing we can do is drop around dog or cat food
4613927 be still when you have nothing to say when genuine passion moves you say what youve got to say and say it hot
4613928 the mode by which the inevitable comes to pass is effort
4613929 i wanted a perfect ending now ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next delicious ambiguity
4613930 all the canadian government did all they said was a brief visit by public safety minister stockwell day who briefly saw some authorities involved
4613931 the incredible thing here in both cases is that the appeal process asked the court to take a second look
4613932 theyre really making a plea for the canadian government and for canada in general to show support
4613933 you know when you would have asked me about it in march prior to mohameds death sentence i would have said yeah everythings going to be ok
4613934 canada has and continues to pursue all avenues to save mohamed kohail
4613935 in this image alone i can count 23 cameras i can see loads of canon l series ef and nikkor af s 500mm super telephoto lenses each around 5 800 a pop a few 400mm 600mm 700mm 800mm here and there lets assume a conservative average of 6 000 per telephoto lense thats 138 000 total just on lenses most of them are probably using the biggest and baddest canon and nikon cameras so we can assume an average 5 000 price tag per camera which brings the grand total to about a quarter of a million dollars
4613936 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4613937 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4613938 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4613939 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
4613940 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
4613941 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
4613942 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
4613943 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
4613944 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better
4613945 as a small organization looking at pre google apps practice if it had been my hardware in house that went down i would not have had anywhere near the reaction time and response to be restored as google did with the apps service
4613946 and theyd be right too you see i am so borderline on the sensing intuitive perceiving judging categories that i flip flop between them often depending on the mood hormonal state i am in
4613947 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4613948 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4613949 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4613950 not less than 50 per cent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 per cent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4613951 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 per cent wouldnt cut it
4613952 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
4613953 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4613954 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4613955 our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and were acting without approval
4613956 ive set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 cost out of the supply chain
4613957 it means between us we have to find ways to improve our supply chain operations
4613958 much of which is driven by what we at chrysler do how we act drives your cost
4613959 im not going to tell you that women are buying themselves lipstick to feel better because they cant buy gas
4613960 but the strength of the sales growth is pretty clear this is a resilient category worldwide
4613961 the bulk of the gains came from our vibrant international business which fueled momentum and more than compensated for slower u s growth
4613962 we believe the strong international results and robust 2009 organic sales guidance could provide relief for those concerned about a sales growth slowdown particularly in europe
4613963 exhibits b d and e all links to chinese state newspapers or websites have been disabled at the time of publication on august 14th the links to all sources worked i found a cached version of the link to exhibit d which is now in the post above
4613964 in a statement at the white house mr bush accused russia of
4613965 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4613966 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4613967 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4613968 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4613969 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4613970 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4613971 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4613972 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4613973 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4613974 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4613975 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4613976 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4613977 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4613994 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4613995 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4613996 the fact that 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4613997 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4613998 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4613999 this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited and the tournaments commercial partners it also ensures that future development investment initiatives in the game worldwide can continue to be underwritten by the tournament and planned accordingly
4614000 we have just received news that the party has been located ms mcmillan said
4614001 im not very good with heights so im a bit scared but looking forward to it
4614002 hopefully lots of local people will sign up to take part if i can do it anyone can
4614003 its the script that initially gets you excited its really funny and that i think comes from the honesty in the characters the fact that its so character driven and the humour comes from the situations they find themselves in
4614004 ranjit is the joint leading goal scorer with malky terrys son as a result of this terry and dr kaskar are deadly rivals constantly fighting and bickering with a lot of one upmanship whereas the kids get on well love the game have other hobbies and interests and are basically altogether more grown up than their parents
4614005 my boy is only 15 months old and i am looking forward to kicking a ball around with him but i wouldnt dream of treating him like that
4614006 also im not a big fan of football ill watch important matches but only in the company of others and with a drink in my hand
4614007 but hopefully a lot of the audience will be the same they might learn something from the series and be able to relate to the situations in life we laugh because something is funny and we laugh because it rings true
4614008 luckily im not expected to play football properly thats the responsibility of the kids there was a fantastic scene when they had rain machines in and terry and i were covered in mud taking penalties against each other and it was just such fun
4614009 the size of the price increase is the real surprise
4614010 we continue to think the disappointments are a product of under investment
4614011 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4614012 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated
4614013 therefore we continue to expect that earnings per share diluted from operations in 2009 will increase however at a rate below our long term objective of 6 to 8 growth
4614014 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
4614015 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4614016 our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and were acting without approval
4614017 i was in such a zone my coach said to fall asleep for a couple laps and then give it go
4614018 i ran my hardest and tried to give it my best i was just running so within myself trying to stay calm
4614019 i didnt even know if i was third or fourth i thought i was maybe fourth i didnt want to celebrate too soon
4614020 my pace was quick and i started to get hot and i made a major mistake i let that be my excuse
4614021 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic
4614022 i obviously now believe that james has been made an example to the rest of the soldiers and to the rest of those who dare think about what james did that the punishment can be quite severe
4614023 i can never be quiet until they all come home it seems like they are all my children now
4614024 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4614025 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4614026 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4614027 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4614028 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4614029 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress

4614037 said to be in good health today after undergoing heart surgery in the united states an operation that left some iraqis wondering whether he is still fit for the job
4614038 a statement by the presidential press office said talabani entered the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota on aug 2 for knee surgery but the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4614039 we thought we could lie but reuters found out the truth broke the story and now we have to admit to the heart surgery
4614040 nassar al rubaie a senior shia politician said the medical reports from the hospital would determine whether the heart operation would affect mr talabanis ability to work
4614041 if the position of president of the republic is vacant for whatever reason a new president will be elected in order to fill the vacancy for the remaining period of that presidents term
4614042 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4614043 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4614044 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4614045 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic i cant bring myself to shoot another person if people want to criticize me for that then im honored to be criticized because im not a killer

4614052 women here still feel threatened one cant yet see a pervasive shift in the way women dress they continue to wear the conservative clothing that the militias began compelling them to wear after the u s invasion most women remain cocooned in shapeless black abaya dresses and hijab scarves that covered their hair before the war tammy says she could walk down the streets of her hometown the southern and heavily shia iraqi port city of basra dressed like most teenagers in the united states in jeans and no head scarf saddam husseins regime was one of the worlds most despotic but it was secular and allowed iraqi women personal rights and freedoms unparalleled in the persian gulf women who make up more than half of the countrys populartion could drive travel abroad alone serve in iraqi security forces and work side by side with men they chose whom to marry and whether to marry at all and were among the most educated in the region after the u s invasion in 2003 conservative muslim clerics called for iraq to become an islamic state in the name of islamic values they eroded the liberties women here enjoyed even under saddams oppressive regime schools once coed became segregated by gender women were afraid to go outside without a head scarf as sectarian violence engulfed baghdad and other parts of the country in 2006 it brought in its wake even more constraints on womens freedoms
4614053 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape

4614063 much of which is driven by what we at chrysler do how we act drives your cost
4614064 people are concerned about whether theres a bailout thats going to be coming from the u s so it would be logical to see foreign investors pull out of agency paper
4614065 they dont know whether the u s is going to be committed to supporting the gses and if they are going to support them by what methods are they going to support them
4614066 most fixed income investors to whom we have spoken believe that a capital infusion by the government into freddie and fannie is a prerequisite for turning sentiment around in mortgage backed securities and by extension in the broader fixed income markets
4614067 the longer the debate drags on the more tentative foreign interest in the sector is likely to become even though the gses are adequately capitalized investor confidence has been shaken
4614068 a slowdown in international investor interest remains the major risk factor for agency spreads in our view
4614069 were likely to see renewed flows into treasuries and perhaps some high quality u s corporates
4614070 it would take something dramatic for there to be a material improvement in the confidence necessary to bring foreign investment back to these agencies at the levels weve become used to
4614071 there is the hope thats held out by some for a magic bullet and that could take the form of a sizable infusion of capital or perhaps a complete rethink of restructuring both of these gses
4614072 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4614073 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues

4614076 this case was about a teachers or administrators right to discipline students in a private catholic school
4614077 there must be unity and discipline for learning and spiritual formation to take place
4614078 the unifying element in this case was the english language because its the common denominator among the students teachers and administrators
4614079 this issue has been divisive and hurtful to our parish community and in that regard there are no winners
4614080 we want to move forward and continue educating our students and helping them develop spiritually and personally so they can be successful contributing members of our community of faith and the greater community as well
4614081 the size of the price increase is the real surprise
4614082 we continue to think the disappointments are a product of under investment
4614083 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4614084 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated
4614085 therefore we continue to expect that earnings per share diluted from operations in 2009 will increase however at a rate below our long term objective of 6 to 8 growth
4614086 they marketed things to investors making specific representation about liquidity but failing to disclose to them that there were potential risks out there in the marketplace that might affect their ability to actually provide the liquidity they claimed was available
4614087 we have started with the largest firms and we are working our way down the list
4614088 no doubt you have many retail brokerage firms who sold securities our belief is those firms are also liable to the investors
4614089 the fact that 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4614090 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4614091 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4614092 this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited and the tournaments commercial partners it also ensures that future development investment initiatives in the game worldwide can continue to be underwritten by the tournament and planned accordingly

4614101 the bulk of the gains came from our vibrant international business which fueled momentum and more than compensated for slower u s growth

4614113 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
4614114 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
4614115 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
4614116 we run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses and those producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures
4614117 we have eight young men arrested they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far

4614135 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4614136 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4614137 im lowering my expectations a lot so this will probably exceed it slightly
4614138 both consumer demand and business factors will drive this growth
4614139 with the advancement of high speed technologies over copper or fiber for carrier deployment the home network is the final frontier to deliver such services as high definition tv to any room in a home the powergrid 904 meets our telco customers current and future needs with breakneck speeds up to 400mbps over power lines qos remote management and repeater function
4614140 thats very important for people who play video games and use other services that involve uploading video from their computers this is going to be a compelling service
4614141 directtv to become major bpl provider in dallas fort worth
4614142 its position is similar to that of dsl in the late 1990s people have heard of it and while we were previously not quite there yet with the technology we are now
4614143 but the speed is not asynchronous meaning you get the same speed upstream and downstream
4614144 i cant get same bandwidth for any price close to it from another carrier

4614146 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4614147 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4614212 he spent 14 years in jail that he shouldnt have
4614213 thats like the worst thing that can happen to someone when you have children and not to see them grow
4614214 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4614215 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4614216 i thought i had some other number ones but i didnt so it was really nice to get my first number one after 42 years of making records

4614230 but one thing i do want to assure the public that this case has not been jeopardized thanks to sheriff ed brown and his department and i do commend him for getting to the bottom of this rather quickly
4614231 at this point i do not see any advantage or disadvantage
4614232 the last thing i want is any judge in mexico to think theres some corruption going on here and that if cesar is extradited back to north carolina he wont receive a fair trial
4614233 i can assure the mexican government that this is something ive never witnessed in 30 years

4614262 one was a gang bang and one was just one after another after another after another same sex acts same stuff but they drew the line at multiple partners i never had one where the material was that close in what it had content wise where they split the baby
4614263 they acquitted the clerk embrey which is not a big surprise especially since one of the jurors in voir dire said there was no way that the clerk should take responsibility for whatever

4614323 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
4614324 we run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses and those producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures

4614378 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook

4614386 there is nothing more fundamental than the protection of our nations security and sovereignty
4614387 the cf have a significant role to play in supporting government departments that deal with security issues in the north exercising our sovereignty and providing assistance to our citizens
4614388 multi agency exercises like op nanook which involves the navy army air force and nunavut territorial and federal government departments are important because they provide an opportunity to enhance our capacity to operate together effectively in the case of an emergency or security operation

4614393 we do have copy protection it is a necessary part of our biz but weve worked to make it something that does not punish the legit owners
4614394 you need to authenticate once at the first install this happens online you can install on three separate computers and you do need to register for the online features
4614395 if i was coaching id be asking recruiters to find me the quickest most ferocious tackling ability because pace has to be the facet you can worry about the football ability later
4614396 it is increasingly becoming a specialised role that has become finely tuned over the past couple of years
4614397 the best one at the moment is young rioli at hawthorn because his tackling skills are so good if you are good at it you almost guarantee your selection because attack starts from defence now and the team that can hold the ball in their forward line has an increased chance of winning
4614398 i think i need to push into the midfield if i want to be playing at the club and making a long career out of it
4614399 i dont think i would last long if i was playing that small forward role most of those guys dont have a long career if they are holding that one spot
4614400 the small forward is normally the first to go if youre struggling a little bit
4614401 the game is obviously a lot quicker so it has certainly become a younger mans game in many respects
4614402 a lot of young players are coming in and they are not just kicking goals but tackling and harassing which is certainly something they need to do to maintain a game
4614403 but id be looking for one of these young blokes to jump out of the box in the next couple of years and start kicking 50 60 goals like jeff did and like i did but its something that is extremely difficult to maintain over a career
4614404 but im not a great believer of that the way the competition is with travel and different venues and teams that play differently that general concept of giving a player at least two i dont think that necessarily fits in the afl at the moment
4614405 everything we have seen so far suggests patrick is worth selection
4614406 the positives outweigh the negatives telstra dome suits a lot of the qualities he possesses
4614407 and with the injuries weve got and the set up we have at the moment patrick gives us a degree of flexibility as well
4614408 in the under 18s he has been playing back in the midfield and been able to go forward and be a strong contributor up there as well
4614409 we certainly will not put patrick in situations where he will not be comfortable
4614410 to be honest wed much rather play sydney than a team thats lower on the ladder because its just better practice going into a finals series
4614411 we know its a hard task to play sydney at any time and to play in their home state is another challenge but i think thats what we need at the moment
4614412 all year weve tried to play the best footy we can well do everything we can to win
4614413 people make it seem as if theyve done this for the first time tesco do this all over the world the whole world does business this way
4614414 ive signed a lot of big deals this will not put me off i will work with tesco again i will carry on developing property
4614415 i consider myself legal i think we are all legal i havent committed any crimes
4614416 sure go after the smugglers the bad people who have committed murder but were just trying to make an honorable living and give our children a better future

4614418 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4614419 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4614420 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4614421 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4614422 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4614423 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4614424 because what the public thinks climbing involves is not actually what its all about
4614425 its going to be one of the most stretching climbs ive ever tried
4614426 alpine climbing has only just taken off in tibet there are countless numbers of spectacular peaks awaiting ascent 154 to be precise
4614427 in the manam valley we met the head man who said hed never seen white skinned people
4614428 it does make you feel youre doing something a bit different
4614429 theres much more reliance on your own judgment and therefore much more satisfaction
4614430 i look for really steep rock faces that havent been climbed before because theyre too hard
4614431 its an exercise in mental control i spend a huge amount of time planning every single scenario on the route in the moment of the climb im intently focused but relaxed at the same time
4614432 its probably a bit hard to understand but the summit isnt everything
4614433 its how you get there that counts thats the point of modern mountaineering youre searching for the ultimate steep line up a face and doing it in a minimalist approach two people completely unsupported carrying all their equipment on their backs
4614434 the emotions are all the same the anxiety the challenge and the fun
4614435 youre living in a vertical world you can only move around by climbing
4614436 clients want to do things like mont blanc because theyve heard of that
4614437 the great thing about the sport is that its free of rules and regulations it enables people to escape the constraints of the modern world
4614438 i thought you had to use smoky colours to do smoky eyes but this really works
4614439 i had no idea about make up but now i know what suits me can i have some foundation and concealer and blusher

4614450 i havent heard anything about that and i havent had time to think about that issue for some days
4614451 are you asking me as a representative of elbit elbit is a weapons company trading on the nasdaq and tel aviv stock exchanges or of israel aerospace industries
4614452 we have two israeli cabinet ministers one deals with war defense minister david kezerashvili and the other with negotiations state minister for territorial integration temur yakobashvili and that is the israeli involvement here both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
4614453 we will fight to the death until the last russian soldier leaves georgian territory
4614454 if georgia falls all of the energy supply routes will be blocked
4614455 trying to take revenge on the united states but instead of attacking the sixth fleet he found himself an easier target
4614456 enabling us to train our army and giving us the possibility to withstand the russians
4614457 israel is betraying us along with the european countries and the united states
4614458 today there was a cossack pogrom against the local population as a jew that gives me a different feeling
4614459 israel did it at the russians behest it aided the terrorists the russians its a disgrace i dont know what it received in return i only see that hezbollah continues to get russian arms and plenty of it
4614460 there are many israeli businesspeople who invested money and a country should protect its citizens investments
4614461 they never believed georgia has such an army and that they would encounter such resistance

4614471 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4614472 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4614473 not less than 50 per cent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 per cent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming

4614475 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had

4614488 it is time to say goodbye to our long held dollar bearish stance for about 10 years we have been negative on the dollar occasionally wrong but mostly right
4614489 the bull market in gold is now over gold prices had been driven higher by financial market turbulence record highs for oil and other commodity prices increased global inflation fears rising geopolitical risks and a weaker dollar the worst case scenarios of a complete meltdown in the financial sector 200 oil a return to 1970s style inflation and a dollar collapse are all much less likely now
4614490 i would suggest that commodity prices are coming off because the dollar is going up but equally people have really got on board now with the fact that the world is not de coupling it is clear that europe and asia are really starting to slow now and its not just the us

4614493 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labour agreement

4614496 what a tremendous achievement for the esther underwood johnson nature center at mass audubons wellfleet bay wildlife sanctuary to be awarded the highest leed designation one of only four such buildings in massachusetts to receive platinum certification
4614497 this is just the latest effort in mass audubons ongoing sustainability initiative by conserving energy supporting renewable energy and building green we are reducing our carbon to protect our climate as well as the people and wildlife of massachusetts
4614498 our experience was that building green did not take longer and had a comparable cost with using conventional construction methods and materials whats more we now have a superior earth friendly facility that is less expensive to run has surfaces that are easy to maintain and should last longer than a traditional structure it is a wonderful model for future public building

4614505 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4614506 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4614507 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4614508 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction

4614539 released a highly critical report friday on nearly 5 million in agriculture marketing grants from kentuckys tobacco settlement money
4614540 oversight of the grants to louisville based allied food marketers west was so lax that the results cant be measured allied was supposed to help kentucky farmers get their products into more markets
4614541 it is deeply troubling that these tobacco settlement funds intended to help transition our agriculture economy were spent with such a disregard for accountability
4614542 the grants were awarded by the agricultural development board in 2005 and 2006 under former gov ernie fletcher who chaired the board the vice chairman of the board was and still is agriculture commissioner richie farmer
4614543 it became apparent that several financial control and contract management issues had been overlooked
4614544 there were multiple conflicts of interest including a 500 000 earmark for rebekah grace food supplements to market natural and organic products the general manager of rebekah grace was an employee of allied which already had a deal to steer products to rebekah grace
4614545 luallen said the results have not been referred to a law enforcement agency because the contract was so weakly written that it would be difficult to hold allied to any criminal conduct
4614546 how much fun can it be when you dont have the ball

4614548 the problem with this and previous schemes including my own is that part of the exotic matter would have to travel faster than the local speed of light roughly speaking it would need to go faster than the speed of light with respect to the portion of space it occupies and thats not allowed by any established physical theory

4614551 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
4614552 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
4614553 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
4614554 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
4614555 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4614556 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4614557 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4614558 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4614559 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4614560 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4614561 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4614562 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4614563 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4614564 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4614565 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4614566 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4614567 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4614568 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4614569 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4614570 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4614571 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4614572 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4614573 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4614574 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4614575 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4614576 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4614577 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4614578 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4614579 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4614580 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4614581 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4614582 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4614583 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4614584 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4614585 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4614586 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4614587 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4614588 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4614589 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4614590 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4614591 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4614592 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4614593 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4614594 what do you want your look to say to people
4614595 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4614596 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4614597 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4614598 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4614599 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4614600 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4614601 opened me up to being just a little more honest in my songwriting
4614602 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4614603 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4614604 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4614605 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it

4614608 you must be relieved to know that alan greenspan says housing has hit bottom
4614609 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4614610 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4614611 hey equity guys did you already forget what happened when you didnt listen to us in october 07 december 07 and may 08
4614612 you cant live with em you cant live without em
4614613 youll never know who you really are until you get into a fight
4614614 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4614615 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4614616 if they are surviving in an area that has had extensive disturbance from mankind and logging then it is very positive as the level of disturbance in the park decreases then we hope they will do well
4614617 they also provide a good indicator of the health of the forest as cloud leopards are the largest predator in borneo if there was insufficient prey they would not be able to survive
4614618 the bornean clouded leopard is a top priority for our programme and we are very excited by this evidence that they occur at sebangau a great deal remains to be discovered about these beautiful felids which are a flagship for conservation in south east asia
4614619 what happened i was going to make your acquaintance then
4614620 you fainted sir it might be because i am split
4614621 i see is that the reason you have come here
4614622 that is only half of it dear cousin jenrao was murdered the previous night at that emperor schubaltz has also been taken as of right now athrios has no leader what should we do
4614623 but who knows what will happen anyone in the council is able to take leadership according to the regency statute of the master law our highest infallible legislation
4614624 father was in the council but he obviously cannot make it should i go in his place
4614625 it is possible but i suggest not causing any trouble the council might get nasty if you offer anything outlandish
4614626 do you really think that those idiots will solve the leadership problem theres a better chance of knocking out the supreme archangel who has turned a blind eye to our return thanks to our darklord and good old orion erathos
4614627 what happened i was going to make your acquaintance then
4614628 one problem begets another you peel off some wallpaper and the ceiling collapses
4614629 forget location location location it should be maintenance maintenance maintenance and as for going green ha the only way to make this place carbon neutral is to burn it down
4614630 the water in the attic would put the fire out
4614631 but how many properties in that price range have their own heated swimming pool
4614632 youre thinking about the future quite right i like that
4614633 yes well perhaps we could start by harvesting the mushrooms sprouting in the lavatory
4614634 you arent the underdogs if you can beat france twice
4614635 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4614636 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4614637 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4614638 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4614639 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4614640 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4614641 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4614642 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4614643 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4614644 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4614645 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4614646 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4614647 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4614648 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4614649 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4614650 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4614651 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4614652 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4614653 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4614654 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4614655 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4614656 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4614657 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4614658 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4614659 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4614660 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4614661 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4614662 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4614663 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4614664 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4614665 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4614666 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4614667 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4614668 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4614669 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4614670 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4614671 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4614672 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4614673 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4614674 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4614675 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4614676 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4614677 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4614678 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4614679 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4614680 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4614681 if you give away cool stuff what you get in return is always more
4614682 the relation is especially important when projects are involved for documentation or support or open movie projects like we do for improving blender the fact people can share content to learn from or to build on is a typical community based shared self interest thing
4614683 just the week before the release we were a bit nervous going for cc by only for artists its not easy to let your baby go and have other people mess with it completely unlimited in the end looking back its has proven to be only cool hardly no abuse happened and the freedom only inspired very interesting use
4614684 since we got sponsored by our community we should give them back the project results in a way we would have liked to receive it ourselves meaning freedom to re use also for commercial work
4614685 just go for it dont be afraid of sharing the incidental and inevitable abuses will never outweigh the benefits
4614686 these laws however have evolved so that governments now have virtually unlimited authority to manipulate dominant firms based on the complaints of competitors
4614687 these laws provide little benefit to consumers in the digital age where monopolies are only fleeting illusions
4614688 victims witnesses and people stopped for minor driving offenses will never be pacheco says the old policy allowed that and some victims ended up being deported
4614689 medvedev ha confirmado que est pronto a firmar l tambi n el acuerdo y garantiz que rusia respetar escrupulosamente los compromisos que ha asumido particularmente por cuanto concierne el retiro de sus fuerzas
4614690 examinaron las cuestiones relativas a la firma por las partes interesadas del documento de seis puntos formulado conjuntamente
4614691 hoy no pudimos hacer un entrenamiento bueno y fue quiz s el entrenamiento que m s necesit bamos por el hecho de que es previo al partido
4614692 nosotros respetamos a holanda sabemos que es un buen equipo pero yo creo que si argentina juega como podemos hacerlo tendr amos que ganar yo conf o en que vamos a poder dar otro paso m s venimos a beijing a ganar la medalla de oro y para eso hay que ganarle a todos
4614693 you could be a 40 or 50 year old man who might have been abused in your formative years but you will always be in that state and it will always affect you
4614694 i was left with post traumatic stress disorder which i was diagnosed with at addenbrookes
4614695 this could be from a number of things but i strongly suggest that the majority of how i am now is down to the trauma from the abuse suffered at the hands of mr conway
4614696 no i believe the onus of consent should be with the adult otherwise it would be fine to rape someone aged under 16 after cajoling them into it
4614697 no my fascination is of small arms of the second world war
4614698 this is a nice quiet street everybody is in shock at what happened you would never think that something like this would happen here kim was a very warm kind and lovely woman
4614699 i would see her taking her dog out for a walk
4614700 this is a terrible tragedy which has really hit the community hard
4614701 this is going to come as a terrible shock to valerie this is the last thing she needs to hear about
4614702 it will put anyone who needs to catch the village bus into total exclusion which should not happen
4614703 the stagecoach citi 4 is brilliant but you have to get up to the main road and thats a long way
4614704 this is the only service in waterbeach im aware of which is subsidised by the county council and it simply cant be a fair deal to the taxpayers of waterbeach that this could now be cut
4614705 the petition and the campaign have shown real support for regular consistent and reliable services and people need to have confidence in the services provided
4614706 it would mean a huge fare increase for people commuting between waterbeach and cambridge
4614707 this will force people to use their cars and congestion in cambridge is bad enough already
4614708 we had a new system introduced for free bus passes for pensioners but if there is no bus this is of little value
4614709 do you believe that the return of the kites has helped local people become more inter active with one another
4614710 one aim is to find hard facts to support anecdotal accounts of people becoming more friendly thanks to the birds
4614711 what tends to happen is that someone out shopping stops to look at a kite gliding overhead then realises somebody else is doing exactly the same nearby and they exchange comments about it
4614712 so a conversation develops between two people who may have had no previous contact and soon theyre talking about other things all because of the shared experience of seeing a kite
4614713 many of the items found although now discoloured would have been white originally
4614714 it could be they are placed in a nest to warn other kites that its in use and they should stay away
4614715 this is not new behaviour hundreds of years ago the species was common in towns and shakespeare was obviously aware of the habit when he wrote the line when the kite nests look to lesser linen in a winters tale first performed in 1611
4614716 in those days kites were appreciated as a natural refuse removal service in towns but there are also historical accounts of stealing hats from peoples heads or washing from lines to take to their nests others of food being snatched from childrens hands
4614717 our original target was 15 breeding pairs by 2012 but this summer we recorded 25 territorial pairs of which 22 were known to have been incubating eggs and 14 fledged a total of 22 young
4614718 during earlier re introductions in more rural areas ecologists advised a need for 400 600 metre exclusion zones around nests but that wouldnt have been possible here
4614719 three pairs nested within 900 metres of each other one just 450 metres from a big housing estate
4614720 dont talk to me you upset me every day with your stupid comments
4614721 if you know me as a person you know the answer
4614722 when green asked me to work on the project in 1995
4614723 it took me at least two seconds to make my mind up
4614724 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses
4614725 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
4614726 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4614727 anybody whose drummer writes the songs are not to be trusted
4614728 god almighty i have respect for sir bob stamp on her though
4614729 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4614730 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4614731 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4614732 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4614733 i had grease on my hands but i did this from my heart
4614734 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4614735 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4614736 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4614737 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
4614738 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
4614739 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
4614740 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
4614741 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
4614742 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
4614743 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
4614744 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
4614745 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
4614746 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
4614747 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
4614748 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
4614749 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
4614750 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
4614751 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
4614752 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
4614753 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
4614754 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
4614755 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
4614756 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states
4614757 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers
4614758 this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire
4614759 a nation of counterfeiters capitalists con men and the making of the united states
4614760 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4614761 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4614762 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4614763 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4614764 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4614765 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4614766 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4614767 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4614768 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4614769 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4614770 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4614771 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4614772 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4614773 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4614774 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4614775 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4614776 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4614777 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4614778 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4614779 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4614780 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4614781 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4614782 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4614783 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4614784 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4614785 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4614786 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4614787 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4614788 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4614789 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4614790 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4614791 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4614792 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4614793 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4614794 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4614795 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4614796 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4614797 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4614798 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4614799 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4614800 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4614801 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4614802 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4614803 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4614804 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4614805 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4614806 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4614807 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4614808 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4614809 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4614810 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4614811 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4614812 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4614813 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4614814 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4614815 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4614816 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4614817 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4614818 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4614819 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4614820 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4614821 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4614822 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4614823 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4614824 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4614825 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4614826 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4614827 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4614828 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4614829 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4614830 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4614831 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4614832 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4614833 i think were as ready as weve ever been weve been through 3 days of training now 2 days of training of love and logic of how to treat kids weve also had training with wheel chairs and seat belts to help us get ready for the year
4614834 were also getting our timing down finding out if anythings changed over the summer
4614835 we try our best our university is proactive our emergency boxes we have an emergency alert system which notifies faculty and staff through computers and phones i think were already ahead of the game
4614836 not so much this was already in the works when we got this threat
4614837 thats not the dogs name that means shut up in spanish
4614838 inhaltlicher aufbau mit passendem text inhalt schaffen content is king
4614839 i had just got to the terminal when i turned round and saw the parking attendant
4614840 i rushed back to explain but he was not having any of it
4614841 the facilities for dropping off people who dont have full mobility or have temporary health problems are not set up well at all
4614842 my 10 year old son robbie was with me and i was told if i had left him in the car it wouldnt have happened but i dont think it is right to leave a 10 year old alone
4614843 my parents saw what had happened and were very upset it was a horrible end to their holiday which had been a strain anyway with the time my stepfather was in addenbrookes
4614844 vehicles cannot be left unattended at the drop off point because they are a security risk
4614845 people with mobility problems need to book a wheelchair in advance and go to one of the car parks or the train station where there are help points
4614846 they can then telephone for assistance and someone will come with a wheelchair
4614847 the assistance to firefighters grant programs are the result of a major effort by the federal government to ensure the provision of a solid foundation for local fire and emergency response services these grants help to ensure the nations firefighters have the basic tools and resources necessary to safely perform their responsibilities and therefore to ultimately save lives and continue to protect all residents from fire
4614848 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4614849 weve staked our claim its use it or lose it
4614850 for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north
4614851 oil and mineral resources in the far north gas reserves put it higher on the agenda than it would have been even just a year ago
4614852 its a bad skin disease and basically you could probably die from it
4614853 it could look like boils on your skin and theyre filled with pus if they pop they do hurt and the only way to get them drained is from a doctor
4614854 we make sure our mats are cleaned everyday we have a chemical compound that we purchased to make sure theyre clean and safe for the athletes
4614855 methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus will cause a student to have to be excluded from school until its treated and it is easily transmitted so its important that we really look at prevention
4614856 one hundred thousand now and 100 000 within a week
4614857 the recent media resurgence of the batman franchise has put the spotlight back on caving and more people are becoming recreational spelunkers
4614858 and the heavens opened and saved me from then on they have been my biggest influence
4614859 r2 update of windows server 2008 that was slated to arrive in the next year or two
4614860 the company is still not yet disclosing specific release date timing for this but it does list 2010 as the timeframe on the roadmap page on microsoft com which ward notes in his comment this of course is in keeping with the 2yr minor 4 yr major schedule for server os releases as r2 is a minor release post windows server 2008
4614861 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4614862 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4614863 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4614864 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4614865 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4614866 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4614867 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4614868 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4614869 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4614870 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4614871 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4614872 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4614873 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4614874 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4614875 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4614876 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4614877 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4614878 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4614879 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4614880 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4614881 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4614882 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4614883 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4614884 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4614885 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4614886 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4614887 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4614888 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4614889 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4614890 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4614891 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4614892 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4614893 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4614894 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4614895 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4614896 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4614897 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4614898 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4614899 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4614900 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4614901 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4614902 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4614903 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4614904 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4614905 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4614906 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4614907 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4614908 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4614909 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4614910 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4614911 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4614912 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4614913 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4614914 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4614915 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4614916 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4614917 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4614918 hes a good player if i was after somebody who was far better than either gary or stephen it would cost 15 million and thats not going to happen
4614919 players are always going to come in to strengthen the squad and its up to the players who are here to make it difficult for the manager to leave them out thats the same for me as for everybody else
4614920 its time for that to change everyone here wants to be champions again and to bring happiness to the fans
4614921 hes very good technically and i hope he will come and improve us
4614922 he can get a goal or two as well so he will be a good acquisition for us
4614923 its a difficult game but we dont change our rules
4614924 i like to play a successful game i want to win at rangers
4614925 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4614926 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4614927 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4614928 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4614929 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4614930 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4614931 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4614932 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4614933 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4614934 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4614935 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4614936 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4614937 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4614938 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4614939 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4614940 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4614941 i love my cigar too but i take it out of my mouth once in a while

4614959 a person who persistently annoys or provokes others with criticism schemes ideas demands requests etc
4614960 under the table action is not a debut i bet that answer made you smile when you figured it out
4614961 but i didnt care it was more important to be free
4614962 it seemed that all of us were struggling to find our way
4614963 what you are talking about is attraction love is beyond attraction there is a level of commitment love is something you have to work on
4614964 i had seen nothing more up there until this past week when c 130s and c 17s suddenly were making low runs through the high mountain valleys there were also military helicopters around it may mean nothing but it may indicate something for the future i am enclosing some photos of the area to give you an idea of what it is like perhaps it reminds you of somewhere
4614965 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash
4614966 my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to both of them
4614967 i do i dont see any other explanation she would not have a child with someone she doesnt love and she loves him
4614968 he knew so much about so many unexpected things horror films pulp fiction westerns as well as thrillers early agatha christie every poet alive writing in the english language he seemed to have a completely uninhibited mind i cant remember him being shocked by a subject or event his curiosity was limitless willing to go through endless byways for the pleasure of the journey
4614969 would simply have to say three funny things in a row
4614970 as our national company we should all be proud of opera australia however as it stands now not many people are
4614971 lets not destroy it for generations to come allowing it to fall into an abyss of mediocrity
4614972 certain allegations have been made and the board expressed complete confidence in the music director and the management of the company
4614973 with my work internationally i dont think that you could possibly say i dont have my standards
4614974 we have to balance doing really exciting new work with a standard repertoire but whatever we do we have to do it absolutely excellently
4614975 this is a situation that could easily have turned into a major gun battle
4614976 it was plain old dumb luck that nobody got hurt including you mr gorbey
4614977 the danger is mr gorbey genuinely believes that he is the subject of a conspiracy
4614978 in his mind the conspiracy is even bigger than it once was now that he is about to be sentenced
4614979 for thousands of years russians and georgians have been living together and now we have war and innocent people are dying it was all started by politicians and i dont understand why
4614980 i landed in the forest and didnt lose consciousness but i couldnt move shortly afterwards a first aid team came to me and gave me different medicines then i was transferred here
4614981 she said there will be peace and i believe her
4614982 i have only the best things to say about the way i have been treated
4614983 they spoke with me and told me that if they were taken to a hospital in russia they wouldnt get such good treatment
4614984 thousands of young spaniards come here at night laden with huge containers of vodka whisky and beers get drunk and go on the rampage committing all sorts of acts of vandalism
4614985 when it gets cold at night they go so far as to make bonfires
4614986 i asked for a similar law to the one in andalusia
4614987 i see the mayors problem but i would never make such a direct accusation against a particular nation especially from countries where we mount costly publicity campaigns urging them to visit
4614988 every other day our municipal cleaners have to clear up debris left by spaniards in an alcoholic coma i worry about the cultural education of these youngsters who cant enjoy themselves without getting out of their heads with drink
4614989 its an affront to holidaymakers who come to rest and enjoy the beach when around 2 000 spaniards hit our beach at weekends its impossible for the towns two policemen on night duty to control them
4614990 how long shall we stay in gori as long as we want to
4614991 we do feel let down do you blame us what happened to our allies we do not know what will happen in the future but it looks like we may lose parts of our country
4614992 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4614993 can you say that the victim of rape is to be blamed because she wore a short skirt
4614994 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4614995 it was our first family holiday together and we decided to go there because it was peaceful its somewhere i had been before and i knew barry would like it the whole thing felt like a dream it was certainly something i had dreamt of
4614996 while there we met up with sion jenkins and his wife tina
4614997 its funny because in their previous lives they probably would have had nothing in common its a very different type of bond they have compared to most friendships but they got on extremely well
4614998 we went across to fulham once to visit his friends from his old street
4614999 we are now under so much scrutiny and if we were seen having a party it would be considered disrespectful to jill dando and that is something we have never been
4615000 he mostly spends his time in the house and we talk a lot he has spoken about how he wants to get his own house in london again but its been difficult as he doesnt have any money
4615001 before he went to prison he had a disability travel pass and got benefits but its a very slow process and he is still waiting for them in the meantime he has had to get used to using an oyster card to travel they werent around when barry went into prison
4615002 he had no clothes either so we had to buy him a whole new wardrobe and like all men barry hates shopping
4615003 the main problem though has been that he is overwhelmed by everything even walking in the street is strange to him he has been used to a strict regime of having to ask permission to do anything but now he has freedom and he doesnt know how to handle it
4615004 barry is fiercely independent he always has been he will need help in the coming months and years because he is bound to have post traumatic stress disorder but he also wants to do things on his own
4615005 at the moment that is difficult because of all the press attention i am used to the photographers as ive dealt with them for eight years but barry isnt hes been in a cell all that time
4615006 i wouldnt say hes now a celebrity but he has become public property that has upset me more than it has barry it seems that it isnt enough that he didnt kill jill dando he still has to be part of some kind of media circus
4615007 he takes it all in his stride but he doesnt like the attention it would be a very strange type of person who would
4615008 there were times my children could not leave their own house because of the hordes of photographers outside
4615009 eventually she got so ill with stress that she didnt eat and drink luckily a vigilant relative realised what was going on if it went on for any longer we probably would have lost her
4615010 the stress put a lot of strain on my body and it resulted in me having lumps in my breast in those eight years i had two biopsies
4615011 when my husband patrick died of a brain tumour in april 2007 i had decided to give up it was too hard and i felt it was unfair on my three teenage children as they had lived with this for years but when i told them they refused to let me stop
4615012 i am a baptist and i could not have gone through one day of this if i did not know i had god there with me
4615013 throughout the week we had sat in the canteen waiting for the verdict every now and then the tannoy would call us back to court only for us to find out the jury had come back with a question for the judge
4615014 on that friday we expected the jury to retire for the weekend and come back on monday
4615015 when the jury came back in i looked at their faces but they were giving nothing away it wasnt until i heard the word not that i realised he was going to be free i didnt even need to hear them say guilty
4615016 the newspapers said i punched the air and screamed yes at first i didnt realise i had it was just a reflex reaction when i composed myself i looked at the jury and said thank you
4615017 nada hace m s feliz al diablo que ver la poca ropa de las mujeres en las olimpiadas
4615018 in the long term appointing a new administrator for these tests is akin to rearranging the deckchairs on the titanic
4615019 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments
4615020 l am v zut ie it pe portarul ia iului i m am g ndit s trag la ce o fi nu cred c pot s marchez un gol mai frumos colegii mi au urat s mai dau goluri din astea

4615029 lobon este cel mai bun portar din rom nia i unul dintre cei mai valoro i din europa nu va pleca de la dinamo pentru c avem nevoie de el s c tig m multe trofee
4615030 julio mai are de spus multe n fotbal iar diakite este un fotbalist extrem de valoros care se va impune dinamo a dat dou lovituri
4615031 ne am gr bit s facem nunt dup victoria cu timi oara
4615032 are you crazy how am i gonna buy any houses
4615033 the trainer said it was sore and i left it at that
4615034 we feel terrible for izzy we all know how valuable a part of our club he was
4615035 this thing was not going to heal on its own
4615036 izzy just put his glove into the ground and his thumb was aggravated again so this thing needs to be fixed if he was on the dl for a month it wouldnt have made a difference
4615037 erick aybar has been doing a great job in the two hole and with the experience he is understanding counts better
4615038 hes always had the ability to hit up in the lineup and hell get a shot there
4615039 its going to obviously put some more weight on other players that have to carry the load
4615040 were going to have to move on but its a certain part of what weve done to this point
4615041 hes swinging the bat well and can give us some versatility
4615042 hes a good bat off the bench so well give him a look right now
4615043 they dont work hard just so they can lay down for people and stay in the match
4615044 they had a tough match against belgium and the girls played really well
4615045 for the most part i dont think they really concern themselves with streaks or anything like that they like playing quality volleyball and things fall into place for them
4615046 whenever i really miss her i just go on google and type in misty may blogs
4615047 shes been able to do some traveling she wanted to go to the forbidden city but she couldnt get a chance to because of the weather
4615048 i think if anything the negative has been about the weather its been pretty rainy but shes been able to get out to the great wall and spend some time with her family and shes really enjoying her time
4615049 itd be nice to be able to talk about the marlins and maybe my contribution to the club as opposed to focusing on my wife but its a huge event and its special
4615050 you could tell how much effort they put forth in the four years leading up to it so i think its very special and the media and the questions are all part of it
4615051 i feel like my focus is a little bit down right now but ill just try to keep it up and help my team
4615052 a couple weeks ago he was as good as anybody we had back there were going to try to get him back on track
4615053 for the ninth inning when you have a save situation you have to think different because you need three outs to get the job done
4615054 he has to remember how confident he was a couple weeks ago
4615055 odeetae is an ancients word for something like anchor mid wife agent or controller neblae is dead but not destroyed narchi is neblaes odeetae thistledown is martyas odeetae
4615056 all i have to do is nudge snowflake with my toe
4615057 in a manner of speaking go to where she died and call for her to return to solid form i can help that
4615058 we cant escape it weve got to teach in a medium that the children can embrace and understand
4615059 its a novel approach way of incorporating math science and nature topics through literature student think theyre reading a fun book and theyre learning a whole lot more without even realizing it
4615060 i would rather read a book on the computer because its more fun
4615061 would you rather read a book or play on the computer
4615062 as disappointing as it may be the hard copy book is slipping through the cracks this is a way to incorporate both
4615063 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4615064 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4615065 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4615066 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4615067 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4615068 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4615069 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4615070 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4615071 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4615072 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4615073 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4615074 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4615075 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4615076 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4615077 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4615078 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4615079 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4615080 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4615081 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4615082 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4615083 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4615084 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4615085 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4615086 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4615087 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4615088 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4615089 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4615090 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4615091 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4615092 the respect for liverpool fans and for the people that work with him on a daily basis
4615093 some newspapers and journalists blame me for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4615094 proper manager sat in chelseas cobham training ground yesterday exuding all the charisma and clarity of thought that grant lacked
4615095 i am very happy that lampard has renewed his contract scolari said
4615096 he is more than a player for chelsea he is a symbol of the club lampard said to me mister i have come for five more years i said that is great because i am here for two maybe more he could be my assistant
4615097 i say to my friend fabio capello if he chooses john terry then it is a very good choice because he is a proper captain scolaris message was clear he will fight for his players
4615098 i need to work in his head because he has good quality a master at motivating scolari made a legitimate criticism of a player softened with praise
4615099 many people in the world think i am not democratic but i am much more than people think replied a coach who has rucked with opposing players punched journalists and remonstrated with officials
4615100 im passionate but i respect the referee every time he replied calmly his english good his self belief unmistakeable
4615101 when i train the players i am the referee i know what the referee feels i say to my players every day you need to respect the referees decision it may be wrong you might be angry but its his decision you need to respect the man not only the referee
4615102 i am coach now for 25 years and i try to play very well and win if you dont win people forget that you played very well people kill you for sure with that scolari dramatically used his forefinger to run an imaginary knife across his throat
4615103 the idea is to play our game as similar to brazilian football as we can said scolari with a significant caveat
4615104 we have some players who play similar to those in brazil others not i have players who are made for english football the characteristics are different
4615105 cafu is thinking more about attacking than defending while jose bosingwa is a good defender ashley cole is more about the team and doesnt shoot as much as roberto carlos theyre different styles but they can attack for us down either flank
4615106 to break the 30 million barrier even before the start of track and field and with a seven hour time difference shows these olympic games are attracting incredibly high levels of interest
4615107 i am a really sore loser and i probably will be gutted if i get anything less than the gold medal in beijing
4615108 people know we have had very good start with a gold and bronze in the pool
4615109 the public know what they are seeing is a step change i hope it continues all the way through
4615110 there is a level of recognition that this is already a more successful games than before
4615111 i am optimistic about this season because i see no deterioration
4615112 we have to protect the dinosaurs a little bit more ryan giggs paul scholes and gary neville but they are fit guys giggs endurance tests were the best in the club this summer and he will play a lot of games for us
4615113 and i am expecting a natural progression from the younger ones last season i was asked if cristiano ronaldo could score more than 25 goals and i replied i was looking for improvement
4615114 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season forty two goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent of the boy and his goal scoring ability but you have to say its a big target where you will see the improvement is in his authority and decision making which improve with experience
4615115 i would say its an asset to be involved in these things it tells you something doesnt it
4615116 when we won the world club championship in 1999 we became the only british team to have won it liverpool tried five times i cannot understand why we did not get the praise or the publicity that it deserved
4615117 committed to continuing our work on initiatives that will secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity to our clients
4615118 he may be trying to make sure that regulators are tax smart about what theyre doing that the firm is not paying
4615119 we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4615120 if local venue managers find that there are not enough people in the venue or too many empty seats they arrange for local volunteers as cheerleaders
4615121 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism
4615122 it is closer to us and we feel its pressure all the time
4615123 thats their decision and im going to do whatever they say go down there and work hard and try to come back
4615124 i started good but my average went down and ive just got to go to triple a
4615125 we just felt it was time for him to go work on some things
4615126 you cant forget how young melky is and sometimes its difficult to work on things here we talked about some things offensively we talked about some things baserunning we felt that melky has grown defensively as a player but we just felt it was time now
4615127 hes a better player than this and he knows it
4615128 hes struggled and sometimes the best way to get yourself going is to take a step back he was working hard up here the performance just didnt follow in his case there was somebody pushing from within
4615129 ive been feeling really good down there and swinging the bat well hopefully i can continue some of that success i had down there at this level
4615130 we were going to get more versatile for our club and we felt it was difficult what we were asking in a sense richie to do
4615131 sporadic play i dont think is conducive to where hes at in this stage of his career
4615132 melky cabrera i believe personally is without a doubt an everyday center fielder in the big leagues
4615133 but he has struggled here for an extended period of time which placed him in jeopardy to be sent down because someone else behind the scenes named brett gardner has pushed himself into the conversation
4615134 you can take melkys name and change it with a lot of guys on this field right now that are making a hell of a lot more money
4615135 the necessary sacrifices of good parenting collide with the assumption that the individual is entitled to lead his or her life only by reference to their own desires
4615136 because you never know who could be out and about and see that and think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
4615137 i decided not to wait another 10 years before marvelling at how young i look right now this is it im as young as ill ever be for ever
4615138 these two cases in texas are just the tip of the iceberg
4615139 across texas and around the country people are convicted of arson based on junk science that has been completely discredited for years
4615140 is that it was pretty much the wild west back then that the state of the science was dismal
4615141 each and every one of the indicators listed by mr vasquez means absolutely nothing and in fact is expected in a context of a fire that has achieved full room involvement as this fire clearly did
4615142 low burning charred flooring burning underneath items of furniture are common characteristics of a fully involved fire they mean nothing with respect to the origin and cause of the fire
4615143 i talked to the occupant of this house and i let him talk and he told me a story of pure fabrication
4615144 tells the story i am just the interpreter i am looking at the fire and i am interpreting the fire that is what i know that is what i do best and the fire does not lie it tells me the truth
4615145 in the long run ill do much more good if when i open my mouth i have something worth saying
4615146 for the flooring on the coaches well use the maple the coaches will be 21 feet long and the pews are 20 feet long so theyre perfect
4615147 more devastated than anything i have seen since pol pots cambodia
4615148 the three actors were totally heroic coming in this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help
4615149 they came they did the work they allowed the movie to be finished they didnt take money the money goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary
4615150 i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath
4615151 you were all alone against 11 chinese players yet you still won you did a great job
4615152 you havent heard the whole story after i scored that first goal i fouled a chinese player and got sent off
4615153 it was taken away by the police because it farted loudly
4615154 the police were enforcing environmental protection standards controls for the olympics the horses exhuast was over the limit and far too noisy it also violated the odd even traffic controls today was an even day but our horse only has one tail
4615155 i never thought of myself as a curvy girl but after trying on
4615156 i begin to understand why herzog likes it here the exhibits in the museum cross the line between fact and fiction between reality and imagination

4615158 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
4615159 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
4615160 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
4615161 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning
4615162 when a cell settles on a piece of bare thin glass
4615163 the membrane of the cell by definition is snuggled up against the glass and available to the radiation field
4615164 it was like using cameras to watch individual bank robbers move around as a holdup progressed
4615165 hey jivatma bwanat naturally be desirous of windows superfluity anymore and how you keeps crashing on foot better self myselfll inviolate initiate ubuntu
4615166 i was a great deal younger when i made outstanding and i can categorically say it will represent my one and only attempt to make an impression in the world of music
4615167 theyve won the league bigger stars than dallas theyve got more silver than buckingham palace
4615168 gonna make you dance gonna make you sing cos those geordie boys can make you do anything
4615169 why fractional reserve banking is more libertarian than the gold standard
4615170 agree or disagree in developed countries during the last 10 15 years central banks have become close to the most efficient state enterprises
4615171 in very clear terms they said this is the last warning the government is going to shut all of these clubs down and the government is going to prosecute anyone involved
4615172 ive got 20 employees with salary and health benefits most of them with families who are going to be out of work in a crappy economy
4615173 i was basically being told by the doj that i better get them out and get them out in a hurry or else
4615174 for years it wasnt a problem but now all of a sudden the same day the feds come to talk to my landlord it is
4615175 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended

4615177 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get
4615178 a country as young prosperous healthy and intelligent as canada should be doing better
4615179 not to say it puts us on equal footing with australia
4615180 im not really upset with canadian athletes im upset with canada
4615181 we dont fund them we give them no money to train we dont focus on phys ed in school were closing pools
4615182 lets face it as competitors weve never been at the top of the list until we adopt a winning mentality and some patriotism we will always be content just being in mediocrity
4615183 the people who follow these sports between olympics they recognize the great performances
4615184 people who tune in just for the olympics they see the medal table and it looks like a disappointment
4615185 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4615186 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4615187 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4615188 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4615189 note holders exchange their 195 7 million in notes for 90 million in cash 50 million in new senior secured notes and 87 5 of the companys new common stock the note holders are expected to recover 86 5 on their claims
4615190 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4615191 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4615192 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4615193 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4615194 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4615195 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4615196 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4615197 freedom is about authority freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do
4615198 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
4615199 these cards are a clear yet unobtrusive way to bring the audience into a conversation without having to disrupt the flow of a thought and without having to deal with voting clicker boxes or microphones theyre a wonderfully elegant way for an audience to give respectful feedback in real time

4615208 this would fully preserve the boards rights to impose any lawful environmental mitigation that it might determine is required with respect to any transaction related activities before those activities occur
4615209 the new approach would assure adequate protection of the environment for communities along the ej amp e
4615210 the chief concerns raised by opponents of this transaction are the impacts of train traffic that will be diverted from cn lines in chicago onto the ej amp e
4615211 our proposal would ensure that the stb has sufficient time to review those matters fully before it authorizes any diversion of traffic
4615212 sufficient cash resources to enable the business to achieve profitability and positive cashflow
4615213 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4615214 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4615215 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4615216 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4615217 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4615218 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4615219 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4615220 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4615221 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4615222 im excited about the industry and the direction in my career now is good im so full of energy now and im ready to do some great performances i know everybody is going to like my work
4615223 i love getting on the road and meeting my fans and making new ones at all of these great cities this weekend im in abraham lincolns hometown so this makes it extra special i wish i could do a private dance for him but im about a hundred and forty years late but hopefully hell be looking down and smiling as i take off my clothes
4615224 i hope everybody comes out to see me as i look forward to giving my best shows ever
4615225 i do this because i love him and support him
4615226 why doesnt he put the socks in the washing machine himself
4615227 he asked me last night you going to lose any sleep i said should i well be excited and im sure he will be hell settle in and i dont think this game will be affected because its his first time in a red sox uniform hes done this a long time
4615228 oh i dont think hes 100 percent you see him sitting on that cushion hes got hes just got a good old fashioned bruise on his tailbone it hurts but hes swinging the bat good and hes running as you saw the other night sometimes you get bruises i hope he doesnt get hit there again
4615229 we told him after he gets back in that throwing mode john and i will sit down with him and try get a target date to return
4615230 i think theres less tenderness when hes walking right now hes looking around left and right to see if someones next to him to make sure no one gonna bump him someone did bump him the other night and he kind of whirled around hes sore
4615231 you bring a young kid up to play and you basically hope that he makes the plays and knows how to play the game and things like that all of a sudden it seems like hes getting a big hit every time he comes up and there seems to be men on base and his production has been off the charts so its been a welcome addition in maybe an area where you dont have a right to expect that much its been great
4615232 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
4615233 it might actually have been useful considering two men with schizophrenia escaped from a mental hospital near exeter on tuesday night and everyones been very scared
4615234 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday

4615239 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4615240 i just sat her down at the piano and let her be herself
4615241 chess is a game of life its got a beginning a middle and an end game
4615242 its a game that can be played from beginning to end weve got 4 year olds playing games and we have senior citizens playing games so its very much like tennis or golf for example where you can play your entire life
4615243 they took a liking to this girl and pulled her out in front of her parents then they forced the bus to drive on nobody could do anything
4615244 they kicked his door to steal everything but when they saw him they shot him twice in the heart they were evil stealing everything and shooting everyone
4615245 the russian army cant be bothered to bring the paramilitaries under control its attitude is let them have their revenge
4615246 we were in an area that nobody controlled there were no georgians or russians there the gunmen came from the forest like partisans shooting and shouting wild men with strange eyes they spoke ossetian and were wearing camouflage the same as the georgian army but they werent like the proper army
4615247 they caught up with him dragged him back to his home locked him in and set fire to it
4615248 if i say something nice about the ksd the kahuna will set me up with the duras sisters
4615249 if sqotty were my chief engineer i wouldnt need a miracle worker
4615250 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4615251 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4615252 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4615253 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4615254 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour

4615257 as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level
4615258 inflation in the construction industry has approximately doubled in recent years this is the main reason for the change in cost estimates
4615259 we have made significant improvements to the way we estimate the costs of planned road schemes
4615260 it would be much harder to make a case for these road projects using the bill they have left us with now
4615261 if the estimates had been anywhere near the latest revised figure it is questionable whether the schemes would have got the go ahead
4615262 it is very convenient for the government that these wildly inaccurate cost estimates happened to be low enough to get the road schemes to pass the benefit cost analysis
4615263 i did a rain dance last night and it seems to have worked what better place to be on a rainy august afternoon than in a cinema
4615264 this is all about a cinema shaped hole in the high street of a small town and most small towns across europe
4615265 there used to be two cinemas here but now there are none it is a gift for me to share these films with people
4615266 tilda is a wonderful person when she had the idea she came in and said am i mad since then she and john have worked really hard people in the town volunteered someone would do the painting someone would do the cleaning someone would hammer nails into a piece of wood
4615267 this is amazing i have come to experience the films most of these are never in conventional cinemas and rarely found on dvd and now tilda swinton has just walked past
4615268 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4615269 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4615270 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4615271 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4615272 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4615273 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4615274 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4615275 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4615276 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4615277 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4615278 seeing established men talking to a kid about incredibly advanced material as equals
4615279 they can make software start a writers retreat they can make products they can make crafts it doesnt matter to us they can build furniture whatever they can do to make a living is what were interested in
4615280 we deal with a lot of women who live in rural villages
4615281 not everyone can move to albuquerque and get a job and there are no corporations in santa fe there are no corporations in taos no corporations in ruidoso so what do women do they have to be able to work at home as much as possible and sell what they make
4615282 it says a lot of things nostalgia recycling the ultimate recycling the if i dont have one center there are rags someone will give me and i can make something idea
4615283 so if you have nothing you can always borrow somebodys loom and you can weave whatever you want out of rags its what makes it so fabulous
4615284 it gives women instant credibility that they have done something and been in a museum
4615285 it goes on their resume they get to see how exquisitely made art is done because it wouldnt be in a museum otherwise that is an educational process in and of itself we want to give them every bit of leverage they can possibly get
4615286 every time we meet women theyll say we know how to weave

4615294 and it raised the specter of more bloodshed as the pilgrimage route becomes crowded before the event saturday
4615295 despite the security precautions kerbala is bracing for the worst local health director alaa hammoudi said that 40 medical units were standing by and that extra hospital beds were made ready near the mosque makeshift clinics were set up in tents and trailers some pilgrims donated blood
4615296 i saw smoke and i smelled the very bad smell of burned flesh and blood the reactions were a little less than at the last blast maybe because they already have been shocked
4615297 women here still feel threatened one cant yet see a pervasive shift in the way women dress they continue to wear the conservative clothing that the militias began compelling them to wear after the u s invasion most women remain cocooned in shapeless black abaya dresses and hijab scarves that covered their hair before the war tammy says she could walk down the streets of her hometown the southern and heavily shia iraqi port city of basra dressed like most teenagers in the united states in jeans and no head scarf saddam husseins regime was one of the worlds most despotic but it was secular and allowed iraqi women personal rights and freedoms unparalleled in the persian gulf women who make up more than half of the countrys populartion could drive travel abroad alone serve in iraqi security forces and work side by side with men they chose whom to marry and whether to marry at all and were among the most educated in the region after the u s invasion in 2003 conservative muslim clerics called for iraq to become an islamic state in the name of islamic values they eroded the liberties women here enjoyed even under saddams oppressive regime schools once coed became segregated by gender women were afraid to go outside without a head scarf as sectarian violence engulfed baghdad and other parts of the country in 2006 it brought in its wake even more constraints on womens freedoms
4615298 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape
4615299 we are an organization trying to end the illegal war we are not endorsing any candidate we are endorsing the end of the iraq war if you are with us on that we could use some donations to continue this struggle

4615325 swissport is aware of the disappointing news that a small number of union members have voted for strike action at gatwick airport swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption
4615326 gmb members cannot afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4615327 these workers are doing one of the most vital jobs in the airport but are among the lowest paid
4615328 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4615329 it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the childrens welfare is in jeopardy
4615330 the good thing is that you dont have to dress up for it
4615331 im 60 years old have a ba in cultural anthropology from columbia university and ive been married for 25 years i have a son in his last year of college who lives at home hes a double major in english literature and religion men call me for an infinity of reasons but mostly for what i call executive stress relief its not sex its a cocktail of testosterone fuelled by addiction to pornography loneliness and the need to hear a womans voice i make twice the money i made in the corporate world i work from home the money transfers into my bank account daily im scheherazade if i dont tell stories that fascinate the pasha he will kill me in the morning
4615332 when i first started i was nervous but after a while i guess you could say the kinkier the sex talk the more i was like wow the phone is like my new toy lets just say i have found myself and my sexuality through this i find myself attracted to females just like im attracted to males so yeah you can say i play for both teams i really enjoy being a phone sex operator
4615333 ive only been a phone sex operator for a few months now to help with extra income im a single mother of two young boys so money is very important to me im in a loving relationship with a wonderful man who loves my kids and treats me very well he understands that im only doing this part time to help save for my childrens college fund
4615334 tuning into mens voices instead of getting caught up on their looks was the same as a person suddenly going blind only to find their other senses enhanced i learnt to listen to men in a deeper way my job behoved me to reach beyond the little mind games i think if all women did phone sex before they lost their virginity they would make much better choices
4615335 the most amusing part about the job was when my partner was in the room with me reading while i worked id try to avoid eye contact with her because id see her stifle a smirk or make a gagging gesture or look at me pantomiming utter shock and id start laughing uncontrollably
4615336 biggest overhaul of legislation on domestic violence in 30 years
4615337 there was a reduction in the number of applications and orders following july 2007 when the new measure was implemented but this reduction was more pronounced for orders than it was for applications the decreases are larger than in previous years
4615338 it must also be remembered that the dvcv act actually extended the availability of non molestation and occupation orders and hence we would expect to see an increase in orders granted and not a decrease overall
4615339 those engaged with the court process felt there had been a reduction in applications for non molestation orders and orders granted since july 2007 either due to both a reduction in the availability of legal aid and the criminalisation of breaches or because victims were concerned about potential imprisonment that follows a breach
4615340 although the government has made some important and effective strides in tackling domestic violence it is undermining its own efforts because the measures are isolated and unsupported as this study suggests however strong one initiative may be it will have a limited impact if its not inextricably linked across all areas of policy and so women at risk of violence will continue to fall through the gaps
4615341 government figures show the number of domestic violence cases being reported has increased the success rate on prosecuting domestic violence continues to improve
4615342 in 2007 both family and criminal jurisdictions of court helped 22 975 more victims than we did in 2004 this is a significant improvement against the background of an increasing volume of prosecutions this is a testament to the growing confidence victims have that they will be listened to and their reports effectively investigated coupled with the specialist and practical support victims receive
4615343 because the police and the cps have targets to meet what we also find is that when arrests are made perpetrators are only charged if the cps considers it a case that is likely to be successfully prosecuted and this leads to offences often being downgraded or dropped altogether

4615345 people are not drinking in the same way that they used to
4615346 and for many publicans it is easier to cash in on their investment now than risk trying to carry on the business
4615347 is to drive consumers away from the pub and into their armchair to drink cheap alcohol
4615348 she was saying that where she is from its not unusual for the hairdressers to work from their local pub we thought about it and decided that adding hairdressing to our menu late every thursday afternoon was a great way to bring in trade at a notoriously quite time of the day its a drop in service so people turn up and hope that she is free it is only 9 per cut which is a bargain for london so if arlenes busy most customers are happy to wait around until she is finished that means they sit at the bar and have a drink or two which means a little extra money for us any way of making yourself stand out at a time like this can only be a good thing especially when it means gathering trade at an otherwise quiet time there are so many pubs around here and most of them are leaning towards the gastro trend in order to pull in trade but this has always been a traditional pub which is something the landlord nick is very proud of he has brought in modern aspects to the d cor and to the menu but he is keen that the pub remains at the heart of the community instead of seeing the pub as simply somewhere to go and have a drink we see it as more than that as a place where activities take place having a back room is a great amenity on top of the scrabble tournaments and quiz nights that weve added to our regular routine were thinking of hiring out an area to local theatre groups of course this is primarily a business and we need to get around the current climate which isnt the best for trade so we have been considering new ways to gather custom
4615349 my partner mark few and i bought this place four years ago with the sole intention of creating a traditional village pub with a focus on community values
4615350 its important that we spend a lot of time behind the bar engaging with the customers rather than employing part timers who come and go and arent part of the scenery the idea of the pub historically is that it is a large living room only one that happens to sell drinks and refreshments above all it should be a place to socialise and make friends a while back one of our regulars mentioned that shed joined a knitting club over in ealing and found it hard to get to each week it occurred to me that having our own knitting group would make for a nice sunday afternoon activity so i asked around the locals and they were up for it four of us met up the following week for a knit a drink and a chat and since then its blossomed now weve added a cycling club and a book club the boost in trade is great but also people make connections with people they might otherwise never meet its great for local trade too as we act as a conduit for information if someone is new to the area and needs a tradesman we can say ok well over there is x who is an electrician or in three hours y will be in and hes a mechanic in that sense weve built a brand it is a way to feed back into the community by creating sustainable business in the area
4615351 holding the sunday service in our pub was actually the reverends idea but it was just what we needed
4615352 the general climate has been on the down in st austell since the town went under redevelopment a while back were only a small market town and before visitors would come here to do their food shopping at the supermarket then theyd pop into the various smaller shops once theyd done that they might come in here to have a pint or two which meant guaranteed business now they have pulled down the tesco the smaller shops have been driven out of the area and that has hit us hard there were only four pubs here for years but a big chain moved in and that really messed with our custom and the smoking ban didnt help either it has been a really tough time then the reverend suggested that we hold the sunday service at the seven stars because he wanted to bring the christian message to people who would not necessarily make the decision to attend a service for us it was an opportunity to make a bit more on sundays which we have weve held two services here so far there has been great interest and the congregation was considerable i am open to any new ideas and would happily hold a number of events from the pub the whole industry is struggling and i am willing to try anything i can in order to help my business survive
4615353 the summers probably the toughest time for pubs especially those without gardens
4615354 despite this the old blue never really has a problem drawing crowds there are loads of really nice pubs in this area but there is a certain crowd who will always come to this one we are owned by the vice brand which has really good contacts within the music industry so we manage to book bands that other pubs would be unlikely to get hold of the arctic monkeys and the rascals are just two of the bigger bands who have played secret gigs here people know that if they come here theyre likely to catch big bands that are used to packing out stadiums and huge venues and rarely do such intimate gigs as playing in the upstairs room of an old pub theres never a shortage of performers or an audience this is a really old venue built in 1866 and what weve done is to keep that aspect intact while making it stand out as a music venue as much as a drinking place other pubs have music nights but we go further than that every night we have either a band or a dj working from the 120 capacity venue upstairs we try to keep entry free or at least at a minimal cost where possible we hold a lot of launch parties and events here and we always try to make them as different as possible recently we bought in a load of cut out platforms with scenes drawn on them and holes for your head like you get on the beach we just want our nights to be a bit different even if someone doesnt fancy a big performance and just wants a quiet drink and some good music in the main bar theres a free juke box that has been provided and stocked by record label rough trade so people who are into certain types of music know that here theyll get to listen to stuff that they wouldnt get in other pub juke boxes we have a huge diversity of genres stocked here not just whats hip at the time by carving a reputation in one area ie as a venue and music based pub we can tap into a particular scene we draw in customers who might otherwise end up going elsewhere and make sure they come back again
4615355 our philosophy is if the pub industry in general isnt doing well
4615356 let us see what can be done to make that work in our favour rather than dwelling on a slump in the market were finding ways to make our pub stand out its never enough just to serve drinks its important that we dont sacrifice the quality of our food and ale and were wary of succumbing to the gastro trend when my business partner martha herbst and i found this place under a year ago we found a real pub and that is what we wanted to play on in order to attract new custom wed rather complement what we already have a beautiful old venue than mess with the basics and weve found lots of exciting ways to bring in trade mondays are comedy nights where we showcase five or six acts a pop from all over the country on tuesdays we have fully qualified magicians while a tarot reader works away on the pub floor other nights we have djs and live musicians there is no door charge though donations are of course welcome together martha and i have a background in graphic design club promotion and web development so we use things like well designed posters a proper website and even a facebook group to get our name out there are more everyday ways to reach target customers even small things like offering a sunday roast from midday through to closing time means we get customers that others miss out on

4615390 michigan is a flat two mile oval and track position is huge there it could turn into a fuel mileage race at any time so you really have to be on your toes and be aware of what could happen
4615391 michigan has a lot of personal history for me and im always glad to go there its where i made my first cup start where i made my 100th start and where i broke a 52 race winless streak with a win for office depot in june of last year its a great track with some really awesome racing you can pass and i think the fans always see a good show there michigan is a kind of bragging rights track its in roushs back yard fords back yard so another win there would be huge
4615392 there are certain tracks that you circle on the schedule as places where you want to do well places that have a different meaning daytona and lowes always come to mind but michigan is one too there is usually a large group of dodge employees that make the drive down from detroit and you want to perform well in front of them the support that we get from dodge is huge we couldnt do this without them
4615393 its so wide and there are so many lines that you can run thats what makes michigan fun for drivers you have to figure out how to gauge your momentum and know where you want to be on that race track when you enter those corners michigans layout gives the drivers the flexibility to really make a difference in their cars handling
4615394 as soon as you feel like youre not where you need to be if you feel like youre slower than the pace you need to be running youre going to move up the race track and find a place that helps balance your race car really from the drop of the green flag you do it from there on out
4615395 for me coming to michigan i tend to run well here for whatever reason and the biggest deal is trying to finish and finish up front we ran toward the front there in june but we ended up making a late pit stop and with all the fuel mileage strategy that was going on we ended up getting shuffled back weve had some great runs with the car that we are bringing this weekend so im hoping we can improve on our june finish and keep the momentum going from last weeks win
4615396 to be honest with you im shocked that we havent won here weve had very good cars and have been in contention a couple of different times it always seems like theres a crazy strategy at the end that keeps us from winning its either a two tire deal weve taken no tires when weve had a great race car and been leading and lost to guys that have had tires weve also lost to fuel mileage before so its just a weird finish to this race in some cases the best car wins here but in other cases its something strategy wise that plays out and it just hasnt worked for us here

4615432 telling your teen to avoid strangers on the internet doesnt work
4615433 the internet creates a false sense of intimacy if your daughter has been talking to someone online she probably feels like she knows him hes not going to be one of those people who would hurt her no way the only problem is that sometimes many times shes wrong
4615434 you need to talk to your teen about the false sense of intimacy that develops online and how fake it can be as well as the dangers that can happen
4615435 what is it shes seeking from this person from myspace once you figure that out how can you help her fill that void in a healthier safer way most of todays teen girls are desperate for a connection once they meet the first person who will give that to them their judgment often goes out the window part of it is that theyre not getting that connection at home or from friends its a normal need but theyre going about it in a dangerous way
4615436 you may want to use real life examples of girls who been murdered raped or whove disappeared after meeting someone on myspace facebook or craigslist google donna jou for starters shes a 19 year old who went on a date with a guy she met on craigslist last year and hasnt been seen since dont tell her about these cases in a lecturing way or a holier than thou way
4615437 you want to come from an im concerned about this because angle parents should stay away from phrases like you should or you shouldnt try im concerned or im worried instead the last thing you want her to do is shut you out
4615438 if they do meet someone online and you later find out about it ask your teen what made her think this was okay
4615439 this might make you get out of your own head and into your teens logic they have a whole other logic about meeting people online than we do theres no way to understand them unless you get a sense of where theyre at not where they should be at keep in mind its part of the teenage years to feel invulnerable and quote unquote unique they truly believe this will not happen to me parents need to show there are other teens just like them out there and it did happen to them
4615440 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4615441 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4615442 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4615443 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4615444 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4615445 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4615446 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4615447 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4615448 i cant even believe im standing here talking to you
4615449 kareem had an outburst in court with kicking and screaming and actually had to be carried out of court
4615450 if you watch the tape you just know these are the actions of an innocent man
4615451 i figured if i could use my investigative skills to get an innocent guy out i should do it
4615452 he spent 14 years in jail that he shouldnt have
4615453 thats like the worst thing that can happen to someone when you have children and not to see them grow
4615454 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4615455 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4615456 chris what if that things breaks down what will we do well melt into puddles overnight
4615457 the air conditioning went off its hot as hades in here
4615458 its about eight hundred degrees in here right now julie and i dont appreciate your sarcasm
4615459 youre going to knock it out of the window chris
4615460 yes it is and id say you should take off all your clothes but
4615461 i cant help it you make me wanna groove baby
4615462 we can roll around on the carpet for a little while
4615463 but you can get off me now because fuck its hot in here
4615464 then you could hear it sink in and the joy and the tears to them its a miracle
4615465 the events of sept 11 are a part of our lives and our national history and a part of our story
4615466 if they want to become part of the country after living through such a formative experience for the country then we think thats the right answer
4615467 they love this country they sacrificed their greatest love their husband their father on that day
4615468 its my hope that these families dont have one more sept 11 where congress has not acted on their behalf
4615469 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner

4615501 called transcranial direct current stimulation which involves using electrical pulses to interfere with the firing of neurons in the brain and has been shown to delay a persons ability to tell a lie
4615502 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4615503 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
4615504 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them
4615505 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4615506 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4615507 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4615508 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4615509 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4615510 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4615511 i thought i had some other number ones but i didnt so it was really nice to get my first number one after 42 years of making records

4615515 forever in blue jeans and some songs from the new album and some songs we havent done in a long time
4615516 i hate to admit it but mostly neil diamond because im preparing myself for this tour
4615517 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4615518 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4615519 what this does is commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child and for the woman facing this question in terms of pre and post natal healthcare in terms of income support the kind of support like paternity leave family leave and an improvement in the accessibility in adoption these are tangible things and very much related to catholic social teachings

4615522 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own web site for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4615523 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
4615524 we are trying to not just minimize them but eliminate them mistakes do happen and we try to keep them to a minimum
4615525 all of those processes are handled by hand all sentence calculations are by hand
4615526 deutsche telekoms t mobile usa will be the first carrier to offer a mobile phone based on google incs android software the new york times reported citing people briefed on the companys plans
4615527 the phone is expected to go on sale in the u s before christmas and perhaps as early as october the paper said
4615528 someone whos actually seen the gadget tells us that both the hardware from handset maker htc and googles android software suffer from a similar problem theyre technically powerful but not as elegant as apples iphone and os x
4615529 specifically the phone apparently a hot item to show off in googles cafeterias these days is big and bulky and not as sleek as the iphone and android while extremely powerful has a less elegant less user friendly interface than the iphone
4615530 for those people that cannot get an iphone or dont want one android will be a good choice
4615531 people who choose that cheezy looking thing over the iphone deserve it
4615532 youd think it would be possible to film with something better quality than a webcam from 1997

4615535 after speaking to joel and hearing of his heartbreaking long wait to see doctors i just knew that i couldnt leave without securing him the treatment he so desperately needed so i worked with local doctors to get him all the help they could offer
4615536 joels problems were a very severe facial deformity as a result of a tumour growing in the middle of his face which was steadily growing twisting and rotating his face through approximately 90 degrees and pushing his eye sideways and outwards several centimetres
4615537 joels face was transformed in one major procedure and although the minor bruising around joels eye may take a while to completely resolve the transformation after his surgery is incredible
4615538 he can now look forward to a future that until now was destined to be bleak
4615539 he is the most fabulous little boy full of life smiles and bubbly enthusiasm
4615540 he will live life to the full whatever is thrown at him and is just absolutely charming he is very bright and has learnt remarkably good english very quickly
4615541 it has been a real pleasure to be able to help
4615542 i am so happy to be alive and that everything went so well im looking forward to going home and will work hard and study to become a doctor so that i can help people also
4615543 i do not have words to thank lisa bryer the surgeons and everyone at facing the world
4615544 joel is a delight it is not often that you are privilege to meet someone who lights up every room that he walks into and to have had the opportunity to give him a the future that he always deserved has been an honour

4615546 we put our bags aboard the maintenance guy said hey this planes not going anywhere
4615547 we read up and learned as much as we could as fast as we could
4615548 that doesnt happen when you land at dover or charleston s c
4615549 this is a very elaborate cover up in attempt to avoid responsibility in attempt to hope somehow that someone will believe it
4615550 i wish very deeply that both of them john edwards and rielle hunter would have the dna test
4615551 she would not have a child with someone she didnt love and she loves him
4615552 its not the normal course of events for staffers to get so involved in the personal lives of their candidates
4615553 only george costanza could have made this up in a seinfeld episode its patently ridiculous and easy to see through
4615554 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4615555 i didnt find out about a lot of it until after he passed
4615556 about a month after wallers fiancee got the playstation at 3 d games in the salisbury mall statesville police came knocking at wallers home in cleveland statesville police detective scott reed told waller his playstation had been stolen in statesville and they wanted to know how he got it
4615557 that era to my understanding and certainly among my clients is over
4615558 they are coming after these guys for tons of money over record keeping violations
4615559 these are small employers they are not sophisticated people they are trying to start a business and create jobs for people
4615560 there are whole industries in new york in which violations are the norm and labor law compliance is unusual
4615561 what we want to do is change the culture with our enforcement efforts change the culture so that compliance becomes the norm
4615562 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4615563 make sure that gen mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4615564 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4615565 we have tried that in the 1990s we dont want to go down that path again
4615566 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4615567 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4615568 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4615569 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4615570 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4615571 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4615572 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog

4615579 our primary goal has been to increase views on our mobile web site and expand our footprint on the mobile web
4615580 were the number three mobile web site in terms of traffic behind yahoo and google so were ahead of all the other content sites on the mobile web
4615581 we want to continue to increase mobile web usage and our unique page visitors
4615582 were very excited that two thirds of all entries came via mobile
4615583 more people were entering through the mobile web than online which flipped what we were expecting
4615584 a lot of people are not aware that you can get weather
4615585 some people will stay on deck and try to find that information from their carrier but we want to let people know they can go on their phones browser to get comprehensive up to the minute weather updates
4615586 its especially easy to access and navigate our mobile site with an iphone or blackberry
4615587 research in motion has seen a big shift to more personal usage of blackberrys as opposed to just business usage
4615588 weve gotten a really good response from active moms who are always on the go and want to know if its going to rain before dropping their kids off at soccer practice
4615589 their kids are probably teaching them how to use their smartphone
4615590 directionally month over month we grow mobile web usage naturally but during the campaign in mid may and mid june we doubled that growth rate over compared to the average 2008 growth rate
4615591 we broke the record for unique page views in may and broke it again in june
4615592 we used as much of our combined resources as we possibly could
4615593 many people still dont feel comfortable on their mobile browser so we were very specific to overcome the fear factor for people who werent sure how their phone works
4615594 the differences between online and the mobile web are usage patterns
4615595 the phone is for people in short term planning mode say for people going to the ballpark that day while online is more for long term planning what the weather going to be like this weekend whats the ten day forecast
4615596 i think were still in the learning and awareness stages right now
4615597 people are just starting to figure out that they can get a lot of the same functionality on their handset as they can online with their pc
4615598 we havent hit critical mass yet but were getting there and mobile web has the biggest potential to attract consumers on the go and advertisers
4615599 applications are great but people are comfortable going online and that internet experience translates well to phones
4615600 right now were making more money on our subscription services but in the future were expecting a more even distribution between that and advertising revenue
4615601 the potential we see down the road for mobile is so great that we feel like we have to capitalize now
4615602 were putting a lot of resources into mobile both the product itself and the marketing aspect building consumer awareness and establishing brand loyalty
4615603 we were thrilled with the results from the most recent mobile campaign and were looking to expand on promotions like this going forward
4615604 all the canadian government did all they said was a brief visit by public safety minister stockwell day who briefly saw some authorities involved
4615605 the incredible thing here in both cases is that the appeal process asked the court to take a second look
4615606 theyre really making a plea for the canadian government and for canada in general to show support
4615607 you know when you would have asked me about it in march prior to mohameds death sentence i would have said yeah everythings going to be ok
4615608 canada has and continues to pursue all avenues to save mohamed kohail
4615609 i just peed when i was on the phone with you
4615610 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4615611 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4615612 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4615613 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4615614 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4615615 where is that rocket propelled grenade launcher when you need one
4615616 the real haters in america are on the far left

4615618 the kingdom has not been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the united states
4615619 if the driver from the saudi embassy sideswipes somebody on the long island expressway you can sue but if they help people kill 3 000 people in lower manhattan and a field in pennsylvania and the pentagon they can walk away from it
4615620 im thinking tomorrow at the earliest but i doubt it
4615621 they were saying the haves and the have nots it makes you feel horrible surivors guilt
4615622 that everything was according to code to the absolute centimeter
4615623 he is clean and follows our codes to a t
4615624 were trying to arrange all the assistance that people need in this level of disaster
4615625 if they were doing the same kind of things that they did in this film to say christopher reeve you know if they were imitating him the way they do some of the folks in this film then it would never be acceptable
4615626 its a huge scope i mean its a lot of area to cover but from what ive talked to the blue cross officials some of the buildings are not the magnitude as the gold building or the one thats on the hill right now some of them are smaller properties
4615627 we take our children into these settings thinking and are told that our children are safe when in reality you dont know if theyre safe or not and in this case my child was not safe
4615628 we have three additional investigations pending at this point in time that could result in more felony charges
4615629 mr owens loves his community loves his family and is greatly distressed by the charges that have been placed against him
4615630 no information is too little any information please come forward help protect our children
4615631 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4615632 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4615633 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4615634 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy

4615640 last night we had a major fire in conshohocken probably in the history of the borough its one of the worst weve had
4615641 they say if you have no fear its not for you anymore
4615642 if a firefighter would go down and be trapped we would respond immediately
4615643 as long as everyone comes home something must have gone right
4615644 of course you wont listen to us or talk to us youre all grown up now
4615645 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4615646 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4615647 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4615648 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4615649 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4615650 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4615651 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4615652 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4615653 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4615654 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4615655 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4615656 we dont need three presidents and thats what you would have if hillary was picked barack hillary and bill
4615657 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4615658 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4615659 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4615660 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4615661 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4615662 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4615663 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4615664 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4615665 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4615666 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4615667 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4615668 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4615669 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4615670 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4615671 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary

4615676 cab driver take me home spent too much time away spent too much time who found this interesting
4615677 now they botch a gimmie defining corsi as a nut while not putting attention on the charges he leveled
4615678 unlike most of the critics of the obama nation i have actually read the book from cover to cover it is a thoroughly well documented piece of first rate journalism are there mistakes in it show me a first edition that doesnt have some other than the bible but is it truthful does it add considerably to the publics knowledge of the front running candidate for the presidency do we know much more about obama than we would had we relied exclusively for our information from the and the associated press i offer a resounding yes to all three of those questions i am privileged to call him my friend colleague and co worker i stand with jerry corsi today as he is viciously maligned by an attack media that would prefer to aim its potent artillery at a man who dared to do their job when they refused when they laid down when they sucked up when they failed to ask the tough questions when they took sides
4615679 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him its up to you to spread the truth
4615680 well damn even if i doubt myself sometimes im a strong confident woman i had the courage to say what i needed to say i did it i made a tough choice but it was the right choice
4615681 weve had some dry weather the last week and a half and things are drying out
4615682 if these fires go undetected for a very a long time then they can pose some problems for us
4615683 weve had a canadian high pressure which kind of brings us more of a really dry pattern and doesnt bring any of the gulf moisture or the really hot humid weather we normally see
4615684 theyve made some strides during the offseason learning our offense and getting stronger and getting prepared for the season
4615685 it was the same last year we had little experience on the offensive line but everyone here is willing to step up for the good of the team
4615686 if you take us all somewhere we can wreck a buffet
4615687 if you do good theyll also look at you and youll get your opportunities to shine at your position
4615688 well i guess they have learned to get along with life without me
4615689 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4615690 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4615691 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4615692 we are upset at windows for not being more hardy against such viruses
4615693 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4615694 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4615695 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4615696 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth

4615699 all of the top computer game courses are at modern universities former polytechnics and institutes
4615700 if you look at the subjects these 8 universities offer theyre not really wholeheartedly behind games
4615701 theyre titles like computer graphics vision and games computer science with games technology lots of ands and withs there
4615702 the early adopters bet the farm on computer games and would have had deep problems if the areas hadnt recruited undergraduates
4615703 none of this would matter if it were without consequences unfortunately there are consequences
4615704 the difference is that training is the acquisition of skills and knowledge as a result of being taught while education is the acquisition of skills and knowledge as a result of learning a more rounded think for yourself ideal
4615705 but because the older universities arent doing theirs were getting too few educated people
4615706 we also see games as ai economics psychology sociology therapy training theres nothing wrong with this but were seeing games for everything except for games
4615707 where will the games industry be if the only public money available is for games as anything but games
4615708 none of this is at all interesting to funding bodies or research departments but it will be 20 years from now because todays game playing students become tomorrows professors by then it will be too late
4615709 im not saying we shouldnt use games as educational tools im saying we shouldnt only use them for that

4615744 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online gaming web design award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online gaming web design project

4615750 the conference committee budget plan is the responsible balanced solution to the state budget crisis
4615751 time is running out as many schools and community colleges are about to start or have already started classes schools need a state budget now to plan ahead and avoid making additional cuts teachers strongly oppose any attacks on prop 98 disguised as budget reform schemes that would shortchange our students even more

4615787 sobre todo quiero salir contenta que no me moleste la espalda y estar tranquila en la competici n
4615788 las cosas han cambiado mucho de hace cuatro a os
4615789 entonces era una prueba bastante nueva pero ahora las marcas han evolucionado mucho
4615790 los organizadores han decidido que los que vayan fuera de la expedici n del equipo no tengan acreditaci n y encontrar una entrada est imposible por lo que no va a poder viajar
4615791 soy una atleta que dependo mucho de mi entrenador despu s de cada salto confi en l totalmente y es l el que me dice lo que debo o no debo hacer en competici n no suelo pensar demasiado y act o como una marioneta eso es lo m s f cil para m pero bueno tendr que cambiar esa t cnica y habituarme a lo nuevo
4615792 es lo m s grande que hay para un deportista y ya el hecho de ser parte de ellos hace mucha ilusi n y eso algo de lo que sentirse muy orgullosa
4615793 xito que supone participar en unos juegos ol mpicos a d a de hoy conformarse con participar no basta
4615794 en cuanto a mis rivales yo creo que lo son todas las que tienen mejor marca que yo que son bastantes va a depender de la marca de calificaci n que pongan o si no de la repesca al final dependo de m misma para pasar a la final si estoy sobre mis mejores marcas hay opciones de estar en la final pero si no es as no habr ninguna opci n

4615799 some people think we have no incentive thats why we dont save
4615800 savings are significantly lower for people who estimate higher for a future time frame
4615801 they think they can actually save more in the future

4615804 this is a questionable concept since we do not know the strength of the direction or association between physical health and mental function
4615805 here is when we ask which comes first the egg or the chicken

4615807 search volumes for words like diet and exercise tended to increase sharply at certain times of the year like right around new years for example
4615808 initially the goal of this study was to just look at the google trends service itself and report on its potential as a research tool

4615820 national advisory referendum on the north american union nau agenda
4615821 over the next few months our conservative federal government is conducting a review that will determine the future of universal public postal service
4615822 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english
4615823 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health

4615967 medical high risk does not necessarily imply surgical high risk for carotid endarterectomy
4615968 the presence of multiple associated medical comorbid conditions is not sufficient to automatically exclude the potential for referral for carotid endarterectomy
4615969 some clinicians suggest that patients with a large number of medical conditions form a high risk group and should be offered alternative therapies to avoid complications associated with surgery
4615970 success of carotid endarterectomy in veterans high medical risk does not equate with high surgical risk

4615974 for patients with diabetes or coronary artery disease medicare expenditures grew more slowly for beneficiaries assigned to the physician groups than for beneficiaries in the comparison group with the same conditions
4615975 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4615976 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4615977 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4615978 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4615979 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4615980 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4615981 my goal is to make this area the gem of the tri state
4615982 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4615983 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games

4615985 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
4615986 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4615987 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4615988 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
4615989 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn

4616000 they chose in 2005 to go a direction and the packers chose me
4616001 theres really no ill will between myself and the 49ers weve moved forward theyve moved forward and theyre trying to figure out what they want to do on offense and thankfully the packers have put their trust in me as far as quarterback goes
4616002 i wouldnt trade with him because i love the situation that im in
4616003 obviously it would have been fun to play but theres so many advantages to waiting like i did and obviously the situation i was in being behind brett and being able to acquire all the knowledge that i could from him and at the same time come along at kind of my own pace without a lot of pressure on me i think it was definitely an advantage
4616004 ive just got to worry about myself and the reps im going to get going in there and making the most of them
4616005 any given play it seems like there are so many possibilities that is unique to this system
4616006 the ball can come out so fast on one play and on another play its a different look its a seven step drop then you go down the field so just getting used to that and being ready for anything
4616007 weve talked about it a number of times two or three times
4616008 but like i told him just the fact that he was in the conversation for the no 1 pick in the draft i think it speaks volumes now why it happened and why the 49ers went in another direction thats a different story but he was one of three guys who were going to be chosen for that pick
4616009 aaron and i have always gotten along well when weve been around each other especially through the draft stuff and all of that going on he was always good to me so ive always respected him for that and i respect him as a player
4616010 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4616011 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4616012 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
4616013 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
4616014 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4616015 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4616016 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
4616017 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to

4616280 to have circles of discernment and to have communal action that will perpetuate at the grassroots level the spirit of people power so brilliantly demonstrated to the world at edsa i
4616281 the current direction of the cbcp to strengthen political institutions to solve and prevent political crises is a kind of a corrective measure of edsa ii which weakened political institution in the sense that it did not wait for the verdict of the senator judges in the impeachment case against pres estrada it did not respect the rule of law it did not give the duly instituted political institution a chance to assert itself and prove its strength to handle such a political turmoil for this reason the cbcp did not mention edsa ii for it did not help strengthen our political institutions the parliament of the streets also known as mob rule instrumental in the ouster of erap estrada was a shortcut to achieve political change it was counterproductive for it weakened our political structures

4616298 its clear kilpatrick knew who det white was he had previous contact with him through his other case he specifically called him by name in this case
4616299 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4616300 this was very stressful to me personally i was under a lot of stress my way of alleviating stress is to make light of things
4616301 the book is gripping and atmospheric though joe figures out quickly who his bad guys are theres a lot of fast thinking faster driving punching and shooting that goes into defeating them and the thrills are only half of what makes the book so cool murphy also knows how to draw a tiki lounge youd want to hang out in and the sheer style of his art makes you wistful for swankier times

4616313 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4616331 ellis is probably one of the best equipped to look forward and see through a new strategy
4616332 people are not going to stop buying magazines and papers but theres no doubt that the underlying publishers the trinity mirrors and the johnston presses see their advertising falling
4616333 he has broadened the scope and he has opened it out quite a lot in terms of the culture
4616334 his delivery certainly entertains but at the very heart of it is a deep knowledge of the industry
4616335 from a third party point of view you can think distribution is a dull subject but ellis makes it anything but
4616336 i havent come to scotland to be the tallest dwarf

4616345 i love being part of a small community when i was in new york city i had fun but i felt disoriented here i know i can run into my friends all the time
4616346 a total of twenty bullet holes 18 in the door and two on the outside the bullets are consistent with a semi automatic weapon they appeared to be made by a 223 round
4616347 i was kind of stunned actually i had no idea what had happened until we walked in and we kind of evaluated what had happened and we called the police to try to figure out what and why
4616348 the only connection im prepared to make is that it was a 223 that made this damage

4616352 at first it looked like it might have been pollen but then it started to get more and more filled
4616353 up until i saw this i was bringing my dog down here for regular walks and swims but i wont let her near it
4616354 i usually brush my teeth with it but i wouldnt right now
4616355 its tradition especially up here in the kingdom orleans county fair loves the horse pulling we love the horses
4616356 only two county fairs that have harness racing and were the first and only fair to be ever get a blue ribbon fair award in vermont
4616357 the money is not huge purses its more or less the hospitality and one of the places that really supports harness racing
4616358 im not going to make the nba im not going to make in the major leagues but i can get a race horse that can compete at that level and thats one of the reason i race nothing like the feeling in that winners circle

4616360 of this group the vast majority constitute arab or muslim states
4616361 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
4616362 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
4616363 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
4616364 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
4616365 you know it used to be that the face of al qaeda was bin laden and the core that is still the case but now we are reminded about al qaeda on a regular basis more because of the activities of the local cells
4616366 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
4616367 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
4616368 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
4616369 this should be of particular interest to the buick crowd who seem to surface and start to travel after school starts
4616370 my guess would be with the gas prices and people staying closer to home in oregon we at the beach should have a good second summer assuming of course the weather co operates somewhat
4616371 getting them from all over uk italy spain swizterland etc and including of course canada
4616372 but because the east winds make for less white caps and calmer waters so its easier to spot them
4616373 fishing season will be in full swing here on the nehalem bay

4616379 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
4616380 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
4616381 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
4616382 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
4616383 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
4616384 i am just hoping that now i have made a semi final a few of you guys will get off my back and say i can actually run because it is not that easy to make a semi final of an olympics in the 800m
4616385 there is a lot of pressure on the athletics team for an olympic games and i hope that the public realise if we go as close to our personal best as possible they should know we are doing everything we can to perform
4616386 we dont go out there to not make it through the rounds we actually work our bottoms off and sacrifice a lot so it would be nice to get a heap of support behind us
4616387 my training group all came up and they basically helped me get my speed back so i think you can tell from that run that i am running a heap better than i was in europe
4616388 the first thing i really heard about it was when i got to hong kong australian team camp because i had my phone off a lot so i was just away from it because that is how my coach wanted it
4616389 then when i got to hong kong they told me theyd been getting asked heaps of questions and i was like gosh the girl who was favourite for my event got done for drugs so how is that not a bad thing to say that you are disillusioned going into an olympic games
4616390 the only reason i did that is you have to accept before the 800m heats and i was a little stressed after what happened in osaka
4616391 we have no female sprinters because sally mclellan decided to do the hurdles so i thought i will put my hand up
4616392 i think i can do a 400m pb that might not get me anywhere but it would be nice for me
4616393 a steady diet of exploitative sexually provocative depictions of women feeds a poisonous trend in womens and girls perceptions of their bodies one that has recently been recognized by social scientists as self objectification viewing ones body as a sex object to be consumed by the male gaze
4616394 why are women so turned on by watching other women
4616395 its at 69 kneeland thats 54 were getting close it must be in the next block
4616396 morale has been low since the firings began last year pru says morale is a word thrown around only in the context of its absence you never look at a hot young thing and say check out that spring chicken but only use it to describe your great aunt shes no spring chicken
4616397 how do i target the older affluent executives with social media
4616398 i dont read many blogs but if i do its the ones of my customers
4616399 it is exciting its a joy to know those people and share in their happiness
4616400 those are the type of people mary and david wineberg her husband are hanging around there in china
4616401 the idea that they just show up and race it looks that way but its not
4616402 seeing him and knowing hes from here kind of pushes you to want to follow his dream and actually go to the olympics one day also
4616403 if ever a band was tailor made for rock band its the progressive metal outfit dream theater
4616404 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4616405 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4616406 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4616407 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4616408 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4616409 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4616410 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4616411 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4616412 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4616413 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4616414 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 minutes
4616415 there is what i would call a very paltry licensing fee per song
4616416 i think the industry as a whole needs to take a very different look at this business and participate more fully and in a much more partnership way
4616417 and if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
4616418 respectful of how much weve done to bring new audiences into the market
4616419 i have heard many of these proposals but i have also had meetings with the big 3 automakers and they are confident that with the new hybrids and flex fuels and other technology advances they can succeed so in all due respect i worry a little bit about us predicting failure on the part of the automakers when theyre struggling mightily
4616420 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
4616421 is focused on bringing the kind of change that is desperately needed in the attorney generals office so we dont really have anything to say about democrat margaret donnellys legitimate legal challenge to chris koster
4616422 what im not happy about is that russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement
4616423 the major league deal is basically what it took in order to get it done
4616424 we did try to take it down another road for a good part of the summer
4616425 but there was a point in time that we had to realize as a club that we needed to do this to make this thing come together
4616426 from an organizational standpoint were thrilled with the way things worked out both sides are happy with it
4616427 i wouldnt say the negotiations were tough its just a process you have to go through
4616428 but at the end of the day we got the guy we wanted hes part of our organization so anything we went through was worth it
4616429 its been a long summer with the negotiations going on but its exciting now to have the deal done finally
4616430 now i can do what i love to do most which is play baseball

4616443 jim spent a lot of work on our olympic movement and some of the relationships he built were unique and weve had to rebuild those as we go along
4616444 private fundraising is something we feel very strongly about we want not to be a burden on state revenues or taxes
4616445 this gives people the ability to contribute on the grassroots level or more if they choose or if they want to donate their time and effort
4616446 theres value in the process whether or not we get the games
4616447 things like improvements in infrastructure and what we have to do to get our city more presentable
4616448 thats one of the positives that can come out of this program
4616449 get kids off nintendo and outside doing physical activities this gives them more to do and more options
4616450 many heads of resorts are part of our coalition as board members or on subcommittees
4616451 weve had tremendous buy in by local venues as far as alpine events
4616452 the more people engage and be part of it the better our committee will be
4616453 history shows that since the move to stagger the summer and winter olympics every two years no country has hosted back to back olympic games
4616454 the reality is if chicago wins the usoc will probably not ask for a 2018 bid

4616461 you cant afford to do this when you are trying to maintain an adequate calorie intake for fat loss

4616463 i thought i could eat and drink whatever i wanted
4616464 our resolution does not contain the way serbia sees the unilateral declaration of independence
4616465 we dont want to put countries of the world in a situation to vote for our point of view or for anybody elses point of view we ask the support for this thing to be referred to the international court of justice
4616466 i can say that serbia is going to accept any opinion that comes from the icj
4616467 i think this is the way forward that has to be supported by opponents and supporters of kosovos independence alike
4616468 i think we should all come together in supporting international law

4616471 drinking games and olympic games are both childish wastes of time that dont prove a thing but at least at the end of a drinking game youre drunk which is sadder a life spent on the shot putt or a life spent doing shots
4616472 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4616473 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4616474 that prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4616475 we attribute this gap between homeowners perceptions and reality to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
4616476 originally the term sentimental was used to describe poets who engage with feelings as well as the mind and if that is the way it is being used then yes burns was sentimental but in the modern sense it means treacly or sugary and that is not the real burns at all i think paxman is trying to trade off his image as a grumpy middle aged man it is very strange he is saying this its the equivalent of poking a stick in jocks ribs which is fine if he really wants to do that
4616477 who cares what he thinks of burns paxman is a short man with a long face
4616478 i am very sure that he knows he is being controversial
4616479 we knew he would say something interesting and it will certainly get people talking
4616480 its not exactly a word one hears every day but as a term to describe dog tiredness it has a pleasing euphony
4616481 although im afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
4616482 im controversial in a thoroughly establishment kind of tradition sorry i cant help it im the establishments anti establishment
4616483 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

4616499 it is obvious that i am on the side of love letters
4616500 anyone can write a love letter and almost everyone has
4616501 you can carry them around squirreled away on your person and bring them out occasionally and sigh or gloat with one love affair of mine that ended i demanded back all my letters they were too good to leave behind he resisted i insisted and got them
4616502 benefited from being taken aside and gently told its not all about you
4616503 the problem with great men is that they do everything including making love and writing love letters looking over their shoulder at posterity
4616504 perhaps the term love letters puts men off its not terribly masculine
4616505 some day when im feeling old and the world is cold i will get a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
4616506 dear sal i love you very much but next time please buy me a train

4616511 hes demonstrated his abilities once again to craft amazingly intricate and compelling work within a smaller vehicle giving birth to what is in essence practically a new genre were proud of what hes accomplished and look forward to seeing how his latest art is received
4616512 as the company continues to expand it is essential we have a strong management team in place to respond to the global challenges we currently face
4616513 this new appointment will enable him to implement our long term strategic plans to expand in the uk and internationally
4616514 over a number of years we have welcomed the commitment and co operation of the chinese authorities in tackling imitation products passed off as scotch whisky in china
4616515 this positive decision to grant stronger collective trademark protection to scotch is an important advance and will help to ensure chinese consumers and scottish distillers are protected from fake products
4616516 the concept of these geographical indications is a very useful thing
4616517 companies also need to register the trademarks in the countries in which they do business to protect their brands and also to help take action against counterfeiters
4616518 china is one of the biggest emerging market for whisky and getting these definitions and protections is really important
4616519 to get the generic phrase scotch whisky protected in this way is a step forward
4616520 from an industry perspective i think this is fantastic news because it puts us at the apex with geographical indications such as champagne and parma ham it gives us a high degree of protection and recognition
4616521 the macallan is the no 1 brand in the chinese market and this ruling will help us its great news all round
4616522 there was some recovery for scottish farmers in late 2007 and early 2008 which will have given many producers a chance to reduce their borrowings however any gain has been obliterated by recent cost rises which have not been recovered when it comes to farmers selling their produce
4616523 while consumers read about the horror of rocketing food prices in the press the chances are that farmers are reaching for the telephone to have another talk with bank mangers about extending borrowings
4616524 for those of us who are involved through government it is not just a job but a privilege to be part of a scottish success story

4616530 i hope he has the opportunity to meet karl marx very soon
4616531 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4616532 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4616533 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4616534 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than with senator mccain
4616535 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
4616536 we should work toward the establishment of an independent international peacekeeping force in the separatist regions and stand ready to help our georgian partners put their country back together
4616537 family of suspect in gwatney shooting say it is beyond our understanding
4616538 making the decision to retire from my position as vice chancellor has not been easy
4616539 i have enjoyed my time as vice chancellor but it is simply time for me to explore the rest of my life
4616540 i couldnt believe it i had to sit down i was so excited this is the biggest ticket item
4616541 we locate homes for them we make sure theyre forever homes theyre not a dog for everyone
4616542 because of the trailer we have hope that our equipment is somewhere is dumped somewhere
4616543 the irony is we have these athletes in the family and lauren is at the pinnacle of her career
4616544 its the moment that my sisters been working for and striving for her whole life
4616545 its all coming to fruition right now in china and im not able to be there to watch it i would give anything to be there and experience it with my whole family
4616546 shes hooked up to a machine and shes 28 years old
4616547 shes never been able to date a guy consistently and shell never have children
4616548 we have different hobbies but we still support each other
4616549 it didnt quite sink in it felt like they were talking about someone else
4616550 when it did sink in it was really hard for me
4616551 it didnt affect him much which kind of affected me more it made me wonder why it was harder for me to deal with it
4616552 theres no jealousy im proud of what they do and what theyve done
4616553 i have to look at it as this is my situation and this is what i get to deal with
4616554 the assessment that time was to get her on a transplant list before amanda had to start dialysis
4616555 i can only have 32 40 ounces of liquid between treatments and thats really been a struggle i used to chew on ice so i have to factor that in popsicles soup anything that would turn into liquid
4616556 when she told me that i said are you kidding
4616557 her focus and determination are just awe inspiring if you watch her in her element you can see it in the way she talks and the way she walks
4616558 just so that i know shes here with me and she knows that im there with her
4616559 she needs a transplant like yesterday shes got to get this transplant before her body wears down anymore
4616560 from what ive heard after transplants people have more energy they feel 110 percent better and im looking forward to that
4616561 im ready to put it in my past and move on to the next part of my life and not have this on my back

4616563 i am almost certain that it was the president of the united states the imperialist george bush who ordered the movement of the georgian troops towards south ossetia killing innocent people and with good reason russia acted
4616564 because this country rose up and now is a new world potential thanks to the work of ex president vladmir putin
4616565 whoever wins the presidency in the u s learns and reconsiders the legitimate sovereignty of countries and understands that in latin america there is a revolution a peaceful revolution because our people have discovered a fundamental weapon which is the vote
4616566 venezuela has been following with concern the development of the conflict and in particular the increase in unacceptable acts of violence perpetrated by the georgian troops against the south ossetian population in this sense venezuela reiterates its rejection of all actions that violate human rights especially the right to life
4616567 the military offensive by georgia in south ossetia without any valid reason spread the calls to war in the caucasus region this conflict was planned prepared and ordered by the government of the united states which far from promoting the reestablishment of peace in the area went to work on encouraging the aggression of the georgian government the international community was once more witness to the reoccurring policy of destabilization and incitement to violence that north american imperialism is used to putting in practice in distinct regions of the world
4616568 likewise the government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela observed that the russian federation protected by international agreements that legitimize the presence of its peace forces in south ossetia acted to preserve the life of the south ossetian population
4616569 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
4616570 you young people have in a special way the task of witnessing today to the faith the commitment to bring the gospel of christ into the third christian millennium to build a new civilization
4616571 love is always patient and kind love is never jealous love is not boastful or conceited it is never rude and never seeks its own advantage it does not take offence or store up grievances love does not rejoice at wrongdoing but finds its joy in the truth it is always ready to make allowances to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes love never comes to an end

4616578 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4616579 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty

4616584 several years ago the economy was always number one by a huge margin but in the past few years its come down
4616585 the fact is when the economy is good people dont see it as an issue any more and suddenly for this poll weve seen oil and gas rise to levels that weve never seen before its normally around six or seven per cent
4616586 support for bagnell compared to the federal liberals at large thats consistent too
4616587 we saw that going into the last federal election in 2006 where larrys able to get that high level of support even though his party might not be the preference for voters
4616588 i charge 25 a night but air canada charges 1 200 and has no customer service
4616589 for that kind of money you should be able to get your luggage on the same flight
4616590 if you cant get the luggage and the person on the same flight and the tracking number says its in vancouver you cant get much more of a failure than that
4616591 its a huge issue air canada is not fulfilling their contractual obligations
4616592 every single person who has come to visit us this year has had this problem
4616593 theyre getting away with it like crazy when people at the airport arent allowed to talk to you about it and when people at the call centre say quietly that they dont like it either theres a problem
4616594 at this time of year we are experiencing very heavy passenger loads due in part to hunters heading to the whitehorse area
4616595 flights are fully booked and of course customers who are travelling north to hunt often travel with significantly more than the normal amount of baggage or larger pieces of luggage
4616596 we do make every effort to accommodate luggage and our goal is of course to have the baggage arrive on the same flight as the customer
4616597 when we have an excess amount of luggage we make every effort to expedite the delayed baggage to our passengers via the next available flight or even via courier or alternate airlines when possible
4616598 it is never acceptable to inconvenience our passengers and we do apologize to any customers who have been impacted by a delay in receiving their luggage
4616599 in the case of passengers travelling north to hunt we quite often have additional challenges of interlining transferring bags from one carrier to another and customs transfers passengers are required to check in with their luggage again in vancouver so as to clear the bags through customs and this does not always occur as it should
4616600 tight connections due to delayed flights etc can contribute to delay in our receiving bags when interlined
4616601 the majority of delayed bags do arrive within 24 hours and we deliver them as quickly as possible to our customers
4616602 again we do offer our apologies to those passengers that have experienced delayed baggage and please be assured that we are doing all possible to ensure that the bags arrive in whitehorse as soon as possible
4616603 it looks like a contractor put a piece of boring equipment through a 2 inch gas line
4616604 knowing that this agricultural parcel is adjacent to established elk and deer populations it is only prudent to employ the highest standard of disease control prevention measures
4616605 accordingly and while it is currently not a requirement at this time it is the department of environments preference that double fencing be utilized
4616606 one of the concerns i have heard from people is there has not been enough public input

4616609 the winter tick situation has scared a lot of us

4616612 theyre looking at saguaros that are generally 4 7 feet something a couple guys could manhandle into a pickup truck

4616622 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4616623 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4616624 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4616626 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4616627 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4616628 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4616629 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4616630 veerappan had trimmed his moustache he was not wearing his traditional green clothes and was dressed in white dna tests have not been done yet but we are sure the man killed is veerappan
4616631 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4616632 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4616633 they knew this not because he said anything but because he walked the walk
4616634 maybe its time to get off our rump roast and eat more of everything god created for food
4616635 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4616636 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4616637 as far as the players go there has been some concern there is no doubt about that there has been concern for quite a while now
4616638 we as a cricket team are no different to any other australian i am sure everyday australians that you would bump into in the street would have some concerns as well but the good thing is we are a lot more informed now than we were before the day started
4616639 there are obviously some decisions to be made in the next few days
4616640 it showed a complete lack of understanding and respect for the concerns we have
4616641 we are pleased the task force came and saw us but they have done nothing to allay fears that pakistan is a dangerous place to tour
4616642 we are in the same position we the nzcpa cannot recommend touring pakistan
4616643 even if cricketers were not the targets pakistan is a country in turmoil we have seen the taliban increase their activity recently with a number of bombings in different cities theres a real possibility our players could be caught in a terrorist bombing and become collateral damage

4616649 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
4616650 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context

4616671 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4616672 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4616673 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4616674 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4616675 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4616676 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4616677 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4616678 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4616679 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4616680 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4616681 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4616682 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4616683 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4616684 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4616685 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4616686 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4616687 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4616688 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4616689 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4616690 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4616691 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4616692 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4616693 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4616694 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4616695 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4616696 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4616697 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4616698 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4616699 we believe that our listing facility for international funds has evolved into an important value added option for financial services providers in this jurisdiction we are satisfied that issuers will seek a listing on our exchange in order to send a clear signal to their investors that they are well regulated and are receiving a high level of service
4616700 we are thrilled to be listed on the bahamas international securities exchange the high level of professionalism and quality service demonstrated by the bisx makes them a first rate exchange
4616701 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4616702 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4616703 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4616704 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4616705 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4616706 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4616707 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4616708 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4616709 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters a little bit and try and get out to an early lead

4616730 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4616743 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark
4616744 this week well be meeting tabitha shes a successful television presenter with her own production company but she doesnt know which lap dancing club her coke addled boyfriend is currently favouring and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more she recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home spiritually cleansed owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasnt worn the wrong thing since her second form end of term disco nonetheless she wouldnt be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without googling and cant find her own 40 000 wet room without her pa relaying directions via her blackberry tonight were going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu ometer then after weve talked her down from the ledge well have our regular consultant deirdre on hand to give tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection wont be conditional upon her haircut
4616745 birmingham is immensely proud of its recycling record and this leaflet has helped to get the recycling message across to thousands of our enthusiastic citizens over the last 15 months
4616746 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message
4616747 people have a tendency as you well know to get all bent out of shape over stuff
4616748 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4616749 the fact is that the iranian banks have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4616750 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks
4616751 acusa putin que no se dign a pronunciar la palabra en el 50 aniversario de auschwitz

4616760 this evening our men of the port harcourt bonny sea route
4616761 we responded and exchanged fire and we killed several of the militants
4616762 no mend units or affiliated groups have reported such heavy losses
4616763 we are by this notice asking all oil companies and foreigners to leave port harcourt because there is no going back
4616764 we are bringing the fight to their door post and we will not spare anybody or companies
4616765 this had been sitting for quite some time and as the clock ticks things start to suffer
4616766 i mean we were elated and me personally since this was my job i was very very concerned about the outcome
4616767 most are family run companies its going to keep them moving keep their workers its awesome news for the community for the region
4616768 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4616769 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4616770 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read
4616771 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4616772 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4616773 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4616774 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4616775 the gateway p 7811fx is a great choice for customers such as students and professionals who want a notebook that can handle all of their computing needs from creating videos and playing games to tackling work school and home projects
4616776 and while the new notebook is ideal for demanding gamers and enthusiasts who want the latest technology its affordable price also makes it perfect for digital media hobbyists and casual pc game players
4616777 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes
4616778 but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists
4616779 were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities
4616780 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4616781 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4616782 you can go anywhere in the world and people will say canton
4616783 this is a great opportunity to pay homage to a man who helped put memphis on the map so to say over the years
4616784 plain and simple a christian church should hold christian services
4616785 how could you possibly justify it to those and the families of those harmed by scientology
4616786 its not a memorial service religious service not a funeral service strictly a tribute to the man
4616787 its obnoxious to drag his religion into this the focus should be on isaac and his humanitarian work
4616788 everybody can have their different religions their different cultures i dont see a problem having a tribute to somebody who is important
4616789 i think a tribute should be paid to him hes a great legend i just hate its being done there but i am glad the pastor feels free to do it there
4616790 you dont want to be picking your nose while youre driving the car because everyones looking
4616791 do you need to consume two liters of gas to buy one liter of milk
4616792 the segment is growing fast enough that theres room for everybody
4616793 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4616794 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4616795 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4616796 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4616797 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4616798 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4616799 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4616800 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4616801 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4616802 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4616803 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4616804 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4616805 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4616806 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4616807 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4616808 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4616809 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4616810 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4616811 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4616812 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4616814 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4616815 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4616816 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4616817 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4616818 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4616819 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4616820 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4616821 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as

4616825 the most wondrous characters displayed in brilliantly coloured significance all the way to the tip
4616826 that one lay quietly in bed sipping excellent coffee with ones head still comfortably attached to ones shoulders
4616827 the cool headed and savvy philosophers how they look down with a sympathetic smile on the self inflicted torments and mad escapades of a poor don quixote and in all their pedantry fail to notice that such donquixotery is still the most precious part of life indeed the essence of life itself and that this donquixotery emboldens the whole world and all thats philosophised fiddled yielded and yawned upon it to evermore daring flights of fancy
4616828 childhood is so unlike adulthood when we become more intentional dwelling on the particular having cashed in the clear gold of contemplation for the paper money of dictionary definitions gaining in life experience what we lose in the deep lustre of looking
4616829 not as our aestheticists maintain in an eternal quietude without passion but rather in an eternal passion without disquiet
4616830 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4616831 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4616832 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4616833 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4616834 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4616835 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4616836 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4616837 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4616838 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4616839 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4616840 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4616841 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4616842 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4616843 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4616844 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4616845 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4616846 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4616847 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4616848 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4616849 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4616850 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4616851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4616852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4616853 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4616854 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4616855 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4616856 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4616857 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4616858 questa la citt con il pi alto tasso dillegalit deuropa
4616859 noi siamo catanesi e la gente deve avere paura di noi
4616860 a tuttoggi non sappiamo dov stata inghiottita questa gigantesca montagna di denaro
4616861 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team
4616862 the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wiiware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4616863 this is the highest registration we have ever had this early on
4616864 i am hoping that her child advocacy and other issues like health will be the focus
4616865 i would consider it it is one of those things you dont turn down
4616866 were going to step up and make sure we full heartedly go out and try to recruit minorities
4616867 you would have to reach out to agencies such as us the hispanic chamber of commerce the latin american cultural union the hispanic center in order to see where the population is and go down to the schools and eventually the grassroots
4616868 educate our youngsters to law enforcement on a positive side so that they understand what law enforcement means and know that it is a way to make a living
4616869 its not saying that these officers who graduated today wont be able to communicate but it makes it a little bit easier when people see someone who resembles them
4616870 it makes it better as far as bridging that gap
4616871 questing marilyn was more like questing me i am a singer songwriter actress and so many personal issues and emotions of my own were addressed in her book it was great to read about someone that experienced many of the same feelings i have had and also to realize that i was not the only one to be asking these questions i can accept that i shouldnt understand the personal makeup of other people but why am i kept a secret from me i have read many self help books and done a lot of work on myself but this book answered so many of my questions it also helped me see where things in my past fit into making me the person i am now it was like getting a lot of personal counselling while i was totally engrossed in the exciting storyline in fact i kept holding off reading the last ten or so pages just because i didnt want the adventure to end what courage it must take to allow readers into your personal life i truly thank marilyn for that because i found answers to some of my questions
4616872 by the time any user was notified that facebook was at a minimum an observing party to the transaction and that facebook was asking for an approval to publicly broadcast identifying information regarding the event personally identifying information had already been communicated to facebook
4616873 this is where some of googles other initiatives could come in one source speculates if the wider ranging operating system is really what google is doing with android well the web hosting and support service for developers wouldnt just be about helping web developers it would provide services for android developers and google is also constantly improving the artificial intelligence capacity of its search engine its spam filtering in gmail and a range of other services google is creating a supercomputer driven by artificial intelligence through android it could let these developers build applications that use its brain whats more this could explain why google has been experimenting with free wifi in mountain view which is pretty great by the way and with other wireless transmission experiments it wants to create an ecosystem that relies on communication between any two devices
4616874 microsoft meanwhile has a similarly grand vision of connecting all your devices with its live mesh platform but it isnt focusing on mobile and the realization of this goal is a long way off
4616875 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
4616876 i dont know you know i guess a few other people turned it down its always how i look at it
4616877 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
4616878 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
4616879 aaaahh ee wonko koka oo chobee says jabba baba loogaah jedi glee glaah jabbababa choda glah glah bababababababa loogah and the jedis are all sure jabba well get your stinky baby back then theres lots of sarcastic swordplay banter im impressed now you die shall we continue my pleasure stuff blows up we meet jabbas southern gay uncle meshach taylor the hutt and everything turns out just fine
4616880 distinguishes itself from the glut via an unusually suggestive premise reflecting goblins wreak havoc on haunted security guard kiefer sutherland a genuinely creepy burned out department store backdrop and a number of hard r unreservedly gooshy shocks
4616881 frozen river was shot in subzero weather on lake champlain in northern new york and it renders starkly the cracking lives of two women ray the mother played by the truly great melissa leo whose face youll recognize from a hundred nuanced supporting roles and lila misty upham
4616882 i do hope that this is the last time woody allen will cast scarlett johansson in anything because in vicky cristina barcelona shes approaching pure trollop as cristina an anything goes sexpot who entertains artistic pretensions johansson could be brigitte bardot dubbed with a flat american accent if you entertain the idea that she might be parodying herself its almost an interesting performance
4616883 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4616884 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4616885 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4616886 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4616887 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4616888 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4616889 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4616890 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4616891 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4616892 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4616893 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4616894 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4616895 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4616896 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4616904 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4616905 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4616906 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4616907 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4616926 it is clear that the credit crunch has hit the uk hard we have seen a significant increase in interest for overseas job placements talent is now far more mobile and we see increasing numbers of footloose highly talented individuals willing to relocate across europe

4616930 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
4616931 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
4616932 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
4616933 every day there are 100 000 fewer cars in the city than before the introduction of the fee
4616934 in february 2003 there were only 90 electric cars in london in june 2008 it was more than 1600
4616935 the british buy about twice as many hybrid cars as germans and most of those who do drive in london
4616936 last year alone we put 250 vehicles on the road this year it will be considerably more
4616937 simply the coolest cheapest and most convenient way to get around town
4616938 we could put more cars on the road without any difficulty
4616939 driving these cars in a city is really a lot of fun
4616940 the cars lease is about four times that of a comparable smart that takes gas
4616941 but when you save 8 pounds a day and can often park for free because it is an electric car you make that money back fast
4616942 there are many ways for people to reduce their emissions

4616946 near certainty that the general assembly will reject the entire effort when they reconvene in february
4616947 conserving water immediately is important to assure a continued reliable supply of water to our customers and if dry conditions persist into next year conservation measures will become even more extensive in the future
4616948 the wise use of water by our customers will continue to be an essential element in assuring that available supply can reliably meet water demand
4616949 ive only recently begun toying around with new elements new materials more accessories more details so the price has recently gone up accordingly
4616950 for example there are elements to my most recent figures that nobody will ever see like the fact he is covered from head to toe in tiger stripes full body arms legs etc it doesnt really show in the photos but there is actually several shades of white grey on his face body the tail is cast and mounted permanently and i went through four different molds before i got those claws cast correctly
4616951 my prices will probably continue to go up to meet demand somewhat but nothing i consider unreasonable
4616952 if i want to buy a home someday build my career expand my studio take on bigger more involved projects then i will continue to push the envelope and raise my prices accordingly
4616953 sewing masking making accessories on such a smaller scale may even be more time consuming more expensive
4616954 sterling remains vulnerable especially against the us dollar the pound averaged 1 55 over 1993 2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12 18 months
4616955 the us was the first economy to hit trouble now people are realising that the uk has the same problems if not more so as the us
4616956 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4616957 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4616958 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook if next weeks us inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4616959 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end

4616962 the connection between caid and the music scene in detroit is strong and we felt this was a great way to further build that connection
4616963 there is a medical need in our community and we need to connect families and children to the services that are available

4616989 well youre the only person i see in the car so thats all that matters to me right now
4616990 the first time i dont know what happened he was trying to tell me something and i have no clue what actually happened the next time i realized he had the signs mixed up i think thats what he was trying to tell me the first time it continued to happen were lucky it didnt result in balls flying to the backstop
4616991 hes not trying to walk people it just happens sometimes sometimes its just a feel thing he runs into those walks where he doesnt quite have a feel on the ball and the balls not going where he wants it to
4616992 a few times i used to catch him in the winter he was a different pitcher i know he was more of a power pitcher now he has changed the tilts of the ball cuts it four seams it curveball changeup well have to get together before friday and talk through some things
4616993 there are several food retailers right now that are mall based that are under pressure
4616994 food that is out of the home and food that is arguably discretionary is going to come under pressure when people dont feel that theyve got that discretionary income in their wallets

4616997 what im not happy about is that russia has widened its zone of occupation and so far we are waiting for it to comply with the agreement
4616998 thats good news for us he has trained all week and done very very well
4616999 hes well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised the condition he was in
4617000 for the next three weeks he will continue on the rehabilitation and then the final part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side
4617001 i have nothing to say about that nothing has changed
4617002 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones but the backbone will be the midfield players and defenders who are all available
4617003 we have good variety there and hopefully thats enough to get us through the first hurdle that will be the foundation
4617004 you would think with young players like anderson ronaldo rooney and nani there is improvement there
4617005 i think thats the most natural thing you could say about our club these players have that capacity to improve
4617006 i have a dilemma with the form of wes brown last year in respect to wess contribution it makes it a dilemma
4617007 but we are delighted gary is back hes such an enthusiastic player and with the quality of his game any club would miss that
4617008 so when newfoundland finally joined together with us in confederation in 1867 we all say it was like a family reunion
4617009 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4617010 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4617011 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4617012 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4617013 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4617014 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4617015 you have to be opportunistic when you have a squad like ours i would just like our olympic players back to help us
4617016 but we will probably have one player in the final the rest can return soon
4617017 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4617018 our fans want a trophy every season they would want the league title the champions league the fa cup and the league cup in that order
4617019 hey janelle whats wrong with wolfie i can hear him barking
4617020 the good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks
4617021 a global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year

4617024 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4617025 television networks should be setting a higher standard of pronunciation and fulfilling their role of informing and educating the viewing public
4617026 mispronunciations are misinformation the casual attitude of the networks towards this matter is at best negligent and at worst bordering on disrespect for china and the chinese

4617032 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4617033 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4617034 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4617035 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4617036 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4617037 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4617038 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4617039 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4617040 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4617041 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4617042 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4617043 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4617044 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4617045 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4617046 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4617047 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4617048 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4617049 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4617050 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4617051 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4617052 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4617053 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4617054 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4617055 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4617056 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4617057 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4617058 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4617059 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4617060 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4617061 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4617062 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4617063 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4617064 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4617065 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4617066 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4617067 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4617068 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4617069 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4617070 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4617071 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4617072 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4617073 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4617074 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4617075 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4617076 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4617077 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4617078 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4617079 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4617080 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4617081 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4617082 since we have through you attained much peace and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation
4617083 but that i may not weary you any further i beg you to grant us by your kindness a brief hearing
4617084 for we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
4617085 that we are called the poor is not our disgrace but our glory
4617086 really jewish christians whereas the two following groups were only christian jews
4617087 let us make man in our image after our likeness
4617088 for this group did not name themselves after christ or with jesus own name but
4617089 but if some one knowing that this is so after he recognises that this man is christ and has believed in and obeys him wishes however to observe these institutions will he be saved
4617090 in my opinion trypho such an one will be saved if he does not strive in every way to persuade other men i mean those gentiles who have been circumcised from error by christ to observe the same things as himself telling them that they will not be saved unless they do so this you did yourself at the commencement of the discourse when you declared that i would not be saved unless i observe these institutions
4617091 why then have you said in my opinion such an one will be saved unless there are some who affirm that such will not be saved
4617092 and these do not venture to have any intercourse with or to extend hospitality to such persons but i do not agree with them but if some through weak mindedness wish to observe such institutions as were given by moses from which they expect some virtue but which we believe were appointed by reason of the hardness of the peoples hearts along with their hope in this christ and wish to perform the eternal and natural acts of righteousness and piety yet choose to live with the christians and the faithful as i said before not inducing them either to be circumcised like themselves or to keep the sabbath or to observe any other such ceremonies then i hold that we ought to join ourselves to such and associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren but if trypho
4617093 some of your race who say they believe in this christ compel those gentiles who believe in this christ to live in all respects according to the law given by moses or choose not to associate so intimately with them i in like manner do not approve of them
4617094 people sometimes think you are manic depressive im not sure what i am going to do but i think i am going to have to ask you to leave the company

4617383 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4617384 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4617385 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4617386 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4617387 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4617388 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4617389 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4617390 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

4617392 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4617393 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4617394 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4617395 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4617418 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4617419 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4617420 we have been rehearsing with the band in monterrey mexico for couple of days

4617422 btw the haracter map can be found under system tools larie
4617423 all the canadian government did all they said was a brief visit by public safety minister stockwell day who briefly saw some authorities involved
4617424 the incredible thing here in both cases is that the appeal process asked the court to take a second look
4617425 theyre really making a plea for the canadian government and for canada in general to show support
4617426 you know when you would have asked me about it in march prior to mohameds death sentence i would have said yeah everythings going to be ok
4617427 canada has and continues to pursue all avenues to save mohamed kohail
4617428 we have decent wages for our members we have good health care good pension we have sick pay we have the good vacation entitlement and what were trying to do is maintain those items
4617429 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
4617430 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4617431 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4617432 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4617433 we appreciate new customers so much that well give them a game console but if youve been paying us 300 per month for 3 years then we absolutely could care less about showing you appreciation
4617434 but now we are some of the best bigfoot hunters in the world
4617435 theres also an igor and a dmitri coming from russia
4617436 what a fabulous display with good numbers of bright meteors and lots of faint ones too
4617437 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4617438 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4617439 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4617440 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4617441 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4617442 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4617443 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4617444 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4617445 i saw you at the gas station last week i was the fat guy and you were beautiful call me i think this maybe the one
4617446 i dont work here but maybe i can help you maam i notice you have a marine sticker on your car are you in the marines
4617447 i am navy and i have great respect for the marines
4617448 america while still flawed in its race relations is now the least racist white majority society in the world has a better record of legal protection of minorities than any other society white or black and offers more opportunities to a greater number of black persons than any other society including all those of africa
4617449 as our national company we should all be proud of opera australia however as it stands now not many people are
4617450 lets not destroy it for generations to come allowing it to fall into an abyss of mediocrity
4617451 certain allegations have been made and the board expressed complete confidence in the music director and the management of the company
4617452 with my work internationally i dont think that you could possibly say i dont have my standards
4617453 we have to balance doing really exciting new work with a standard repertoire but whatever we do we have to do it absolutely excellently
4617454 we have looked at partners for a lot of things and we aregoing to continue to do that for the best business model
4617455 this evening our men of the joint task force came underattack around alakiri on the port harcourt bonny sea route
4617456 we responded and exchanged fire and we killedseveral of the militants
4617457 no mend units or affiliated groups have reported such heavylosses
4617458 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4617459 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4617460 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4617461 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4617462 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4617463 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4617464 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4617465 i just want to be nominated for an award for all the work ive done
4617466 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4617467 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4617468 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4617469 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4617470 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4617471 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4617472 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4617473 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4617474 vi no pal cio da justi a sob a porta de uma sala um velho advogado que esperava j de toga vestida a sua vez de falar
4617475 dizem os m dicos que os doentes do cora o n o devem discutir causas
4617476 el culto del cenote en el centro de yucat n
4617477 desde la prehistoria los campesinos rend an culto a las fuerzas naturales c smicas espirituales y los principios celestes pues ellas les proporcionaban comida y los proteg an de los fen menos meteorol gicos adem s de que los defend an de las enfermedades
4617478 los pueblos ind genas y agr colas viven una fusi n entre el hombre y la naturaleza por esta raz n el ritual para ellos es muy importante ya que creen que lo que tienen lo consiguen a trav s de la magia y los rituales de hechicer a la gente est convencida de que obtiene salud amor buena fortuna alivio en sus necesidades y adivinaci n del futuro mediante la veneraci n a las fuerzas c smicas
4617479 todas esas pr cticas tienen que ver con un nivel socioecon mico a mayor necesidad material mayores fen menos de este tipo ya que quienes tienen todas sus necesidades cubiertas salud educaci n dinero gastos de la vida cotidiana no tienen que recurrir a la magia o a la religi n
4617480 la tendencia actual es un sincretismo de elementos de todo tipo que cada persona adapta a sus necesidades econ micas y espirituales
4617481 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
4617482 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
4617483 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
4617484 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
4617485 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
4617486 we have looked at partners for a lot of things and we are going to continue to do that for the best business model
4617487 this cap on the capital cost of the turk plant limits thefinancial risk to texas ratepayers
4617488 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4617489 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4617490 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4617491 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4617492 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4617493 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4617494 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4617495 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4617496 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4617497 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4617498 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4617499 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4617500 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4617501 it would be a remake of night of the living dead
4617502 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4617503 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4617504 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4617505 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4617506 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4617507 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4617508 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4617509 who are open to doing something on the production side
4617510 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4617511 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4617512 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4617513 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4617514 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4617515 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4617516 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4617517 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4617518 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4617519 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4617520 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4617521 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4617522 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4617523 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4617524 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4617525 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4617526 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4617527 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4617528 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4617529 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4617530 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4617531 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4617532 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4617533 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4617534 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4617535 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4617536 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4617537 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4617538 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4617539 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4617540 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4617541 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4617560 we are a turnaround case so it wont be the same this time
4617561 we want to make our clothing more than functional to look at form by drawing on the great tradition of scandinavian design
4617562 we have a wonderful history based since 1877 in the same small town moss in norway as makers of the original protective layer between people and the weather
4617563 what we did wrong was to develop clothing lines for this part of the market the new york rappers but then of course their interest suddenly dropped and we were left with warehouses full of clothing that nobody wanted to wear
4617564 not that we mind at all our brand becoming popular
4617565 we want to increase size and effort behind our lifestyle range
4617566 every spring in fashion magazines lots of the inspiration is nautical who could claim more legitimacy in the marine area than us we sponsor olympic sailing athletes and have two boats in the volvo ocean race
4617567 before the new york rappers did not pick up the clothing as having a connection with something special whereas with this approach now our customers like the activity of sailing or the outdoors and then they are attracted to our products
4617568 nike was a wonderful place to work and while i was there it grew from 1bn to 15bn
4617569 i was ready to leave at that point because when a company is that big it becomes more institutionalised im best when a company is at a real growth stage
4617570 helly hansen is mid sized with the potential to become really big
4617571 it is private equity owned and thats fun because theres the opportunity to mould the business
4617572 we want to open our first flagship store in england next year which we do when we want a window to the customer rather than as a money making opportunity
4617573 some people might choose not to travel as far as maybe the finances are a little bit less safe now
4617574 they may stay at home and go for an adventure outdoor holiday but the other way is that some people might buy less
4617575 it is bad for all outdoor clothing brands about 15 years back you could always count on winter being good in scandinavia and the us but you cant take that as a given any more its something we as an industry will have to deal with especially when we have to order our ranges from asia 18 months ahead

4617577 not possible to transfer profits or losses made elsewhere into the uk for tax purposes
4617578 transfer pricing rules require that if you do a transfer of some sort of position from the us to the uk you need to do it at market price in other words if the thing is loss making the uk buys it at that lower price the loss having been made in the us
4617579 although further talks have taken place with adecco and its advisers adecco has not increased the level of its offer
4617580 adecco believes that there is scope for a combination with michael page which is to the benefit of both companies and their respective shareholders it is important to adecco that it is able to retain the senior management of michael page in the event that an offer is completed adecco has been unable to engage in satisfactory discussions to gain comfort on this issue
4617581 will be very transparent about these things as well as about pricing
4617582 frank biondis extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with john chapples deep management experience in telecoms will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4617583 interestingly the sharp currency moves have left the us quote trading at a 10pc premium to the uk versus the normal 3pc this is unlikely to be maintained and we expect the uk quote to play catch up
4617584 we expect further earnings downgrades this year as analysts revise down their margin assumptions to account for the likelihood of more promotional activity in non food and price reductions in food
4617585 notwithstanding the tough retail environment we can see an excellent profit opportunity over the next five years as the retail business returns to historic levels of profit
4617586 we see the risk reward balance for gkn as positively skewed towards reward
4617587 sectors with a large number of employees are most exposed

4617596 we take great care of our winners including offering them advice about the best way to handle their money
4617597 some of our winners may have never heard of investment accounts and stocks and shares we want them to really enjoy their money and make sure they still have some left after they get over the initial excitement
4617598 we are thrilled to have been appointed to provide financial planning and advice to the biggest lottery winners
4617599 part of our role is to protect them from inducements from investment banks and other independent financial advisers ifas who in these lean times have taken to cold calling lottery winners in a bid to boost client numbers
4617600 import prices this year will be 10 per cent higher than they were last year we have seen nothing like that nothing on that scale at all since the early 1990s that is bound to contribute to this what we hope will be a temporary rise in inflation

4617622 they kept whispering in my ear to ask why i wasnt smiling i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married i pleaded with them to help me escape but no one saw anything wrong in what was happening i begged my husband not to marry me but he told me i had no choice
4617623 it was disgusting awful i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender inside it killed me inside life became meaningless i had my childhood taken away and missed out on all my teenage years sometimes i still wonder if its worth trying to have a future many days im not at all sure it is
4617624 you cannot take examples from the life of our prophet peace be upon him and then apply them to yourself
4617625 within the grand picture of islam today marriages taking place at such a young age are very rare this barbaric practice is nothing to do with islam this in itself goes against the rights of a human let alone a religion
4617626 id like to point out that nowehere does islam commend marriage at such young age
4617627 every manifestation of it should be opposed at every level from the most important to the most trivial
4617628 ill defend to the death your right to say it
4617629 we believe he split the moon in two and returned the sun after it had set now find me one person living on this planet who claims to do this let alone actually carry these acts out
4617630 islam should be and most likely is illegal in accord with most western constitutions
4617631 i sincerely thank johann for his courage and intend to follow his example by being openly critical of islam in particular and religion in general
4617632 the scholars like ibn shubrume uthman al betti abu bakr al asam did not accept this standpoint
4617633 make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage if then ye find sound judgement in them release their property to them
4617634 yes i am being sarcastic it comes with the territory of being a woman myself it is just so obvious to me
4617635 yes yanabi we do actually have a dozen people living on this planet who have actually walked on the moon unlike poor old mohammads hallucinations
4617636 if you bury your head deep enough in the sand
4617637 johann i bow to you we need tons of free speech our children and the children of muslims will thank us for it
4617638 there is no belief system religious or secular that can justify such an act
4617639 you know the central prayer of muslims repeated 17 times a day ends with words of not invoking gods wrath like the jews and not going astray like christians sounds peaceful
4617640 yanabi user people do have the right to critcise islam and any other belief system if they wish to when i read about a ten year old being married in the yemen then i dont need to read the koran or study islam to know that it is wrong if your prophet was to stand before me himself and tell me it was right i would still say it was wrong and i would be right
4617641 i think yanabi user is an exponent of dawah secular governments get lured continue to get lulled into a false sense of security through this
4617642 he even bragged about having abundance of widows and virgins children to choose from this fact even made its way into the koran allah was such a good friend of muhammad
4617643 if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans marry women of your choice two or three or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with them then only one to prevent you from doing injustice
4617644 hmm depends on what the imam was saying and what your friend was praying for you know the central prayer of muslims repeated 17 times a day ends with words of not invoking gods wrath like the jews and not going astray like christians sounds peaceful
4617645 talking of children of single mothers in muhammads time yes muhammad made a lot of widows as his followers lost their lives fighting for muhammad he even bragged about having abundance of widows and virgins children to choose from this fact even made its way into the koran
4617646 if you admire muhammad you could just as well admire stalin adolf hitler and their likes
4617647 i realise that paedophillia occurs in every race culture and creed but in most cultures and countries it is banned by the law and anyone breaking that law is a criminal who will be prosecuted if caught

4617649 the scholars like ibn shubrume uthman al betti abu bakr al asam did not accept this standpoint
4617650 make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage if then ye find sound judgement in them release their property to them
4617651 id like to point out that nowehere does islam commend marriage at such young age
4617652 i am not denying to right to criticise the fact that a 10yr old got married in yemen but what has that got to do with islam
4617653 man made law of age of marriage is 15 years
4617654 dr ahmad a saudi marriage officiant it is allowed to marry a girl at the age of one if sex is postponed the prophet muhammad whose model we follow married aisha when she was six and had sex with her when she was nine
4617655 johann haro forgets that in islamic law the permission of the bride is obligatory thus forced marriages are forbidden
4617656 a woman who has been previously married is more entitled to her person than her guardian and a virgin must be asked for her consent for herself and her consent is her silence
4617657 a matron should not be given in marriage except after consulting her and a virgin should not be given in marriage except after her permission
4617658 with regard to the wedding party of a young married girl at the time of consummating the marriage if the husband and the guardian of the girl agree upon something that will not cause harm to the young girl then that may be done if they disagree then ahmad and abu ubayd say that once a girl reaches the age of nine then the marriage may be consummated even without her consent but that does not apply in the case of who is younger maalik and abu haneefah said the marriage may be consummated when the girl is able for intercourse which varies from one girl to another so no age limit can be set this is the correct view
4617659 when all is said and done we wouldnt be surprised to see very little global oil demand growth over this year and next
4617660 even if retail prices ease it seems unlikely that motorists who have purchased smaller cars will revert to gas guzzling vehicles
4617661 nevertheless the transition to a more fuel efficient u s fleet will take some time
4617662 in a couple of years time when things settle down well point back and say that was the peak and well all be trying to analyze when we get back to that peak again which i think we will
4617663 of course this will no doubt unleash the hordes of militant athiests using ad hominem attacks they are the rudest people ive ever met

4617667 the bbc recently sent out identically qualified cvs to hundreds of employers those with muslim names were 50 per cent less likely to get interviews
4617668 christianity is not a set of laws but an over arching ethos about free will in an imperfect world
4617669 you cite the case of a six year old girl married to a much older man i didnt notice you launching an anti christianity bashing session when six american marines gang raped an under age girl in iraq having shot her younger sister in front of her to get her in the mood and then threw her in a bonfire whilst still alive
4617670 i am a christian now and that is never going to change
4617671 when you believe you become more aware of the unseen world and i have been given loads of evidence but i cannot prove it to anyone
4617672 lets just say that i am completely happy now and confident and remain intellectually curious applying for entry to do my phd the universe is huge i know but the god who made it knows who i am and loves me perfectly my short term plan is to make the best use of this life on earth however long term i look forward to eternity he who seeks finds

4617676 the term islamism without distinguishing between its reformist and violent wings
4617677 lesbians and gay men are part of muslim faith and society we are not going to be silenced or victimised any more we are out and proud as both gays and muslims
4617678 while islamophobia watch talk about defending muslims they end up defending the nastiest and most right wing part of the muslim community the ones who are oppressing and killing the rest
4617679 perhaps it has not happened because of the insane islamophilia of the police the media the government councils schools colleges universities etc which allows fascism incitement to murder and bigotry thrive so long as the bigot is a muslim with brown skin
4617680 for example the gay rights campaigner brett lock wrote to one of the websites authors asking if he really thinks it is islamophobic for gay people to resist sharia law a system that demands we should be lashed or stoned
4617681 as with adultery i think its not homosexuality as such thats an offence but the sexual act itself
4617682 in response to my column yesterday saying we should criticise all supernatural belief systems including islam a torrent of e mailers and bloggers have predictably dubbed me an islamophobe
4617683 do you believe a religious leader who fights to save section 28 and says gay people spread disease is a fulminating bigot
4617684 do you believe sharia law which requires gay people to be lashed or stoned is always and forever unacceptable
4617685 people who believe in opposing hatred of gay people everywhere in teheran as much as tunbridge wells in kingston jamaica as much as kingston upon thames are being subjected to a bizarre counter campaign as so often peter tatchell is facing the most abusive backlash on our behalf tatchell believes all people are equal regardless of their pigmentation he does not see a difference between the white far right preacher jerry falwell calling gay people diseased and the muslim leader sir iqbal sacranie doing the same he does not see the difference between gay teenagers being lynched to death in jamaica and murderous gay bashings on clapham common he reacts to them in exactly the same way by fighting to stop them
4617686 the term islamism without distinguishing between its reformist and violent wings
4617687 lesbians and gay men are part of muslim faith and society
4617688 pack up his bent bags and head back to australia
4617689 the website which has also attacked me i should add reminds me of the people who respond to every criticism of israel by accusing the critic of anti semitism it is a poisonous way of avoiding a serious debate about the facts
4617690 they defend sacranie on the grounds that his homophobia is part of his religion
4617691 but religions are just another set of ideas formulated by human beings and open to human discussion
4617692 islamophobia watch and the dense chunk of the hard left that adopts a similar approach is trying to redefine consistent atheism as a form of racism
4617693 i believe that the idea of god has been a disaster for humanity and any person who bases their morality on the writings of hallucinating pre modern nomads is going to have pretty warped values
4617694 islam is no worse than the absurdities of christianity and judaism but it is no better
4617695 the real racism comes from islamophobia watch itself and the people who parrot their claims where tatchell treats muslims as the equal citizens of a democracy people with open minds and a free intelligence they treat muslims as feeble children who cannot cope with the scorn we routinely and rightly pour on catholics and protestants they argue that muslims are so sensitive and uncurious that their ideas must be ring fenced from criticism with the police arresting anybody who vehemently criticises their beliefs
4617696 indeed in their shrill condemnations of anybody who criticises islam they have actually fundamentally misunderstood islam itself like all religions it is based on a dense contradictory and often ludicrous holy book that is being constantly reinterpreted
4617697 at the moment there is a fierce battle within islam between fundamentalists with a viciously reactionary agenda and liberals with a more moderate agenda
4617698 if muslim women and muslim gays are going to have any kind of decent life the liberals need to receive solidarity and support but slap dash charges of islamophobia intimidate people who could offer it
4617699 they make people afraid to help the muslim critics of fundamentalism encouraging people to see islam as a homogenous block defined by its most reactionary elements
4617700 while islamophobia watch talk about defending muslims they end up defending the nastiest and most right wing part of the muslim community the ones who are oppressing and killing the rest
4617701 for example the gay rights campaigner brett lock wrote to one of the websites authors asking if he really thinks it is islamophobic for gay people to resist sharia law a system that demands we should be lashed or stoned
4617702 as with adultery i think its not homosexuality as such thats an offence but the sexual act itself and you need four independent witnesses for a conviction
4617703 dont worry its okay to be gay or lesbian under sharia law as long as you dont sleep together
4617704 you can ask the editors of the islamophobia watch website why they continue to demonise gay men who resist sharia law at editorial islamophobia watch com
4617705 like all people who cry wolf those who cry islamophobia are aiding and abetting the real wolves out there there is an authentic islamophobia howling in the background it is the notion that islam is a uniquely evil religion more inherently war like and fanatical than christianity or judaism or the other primitive delusions these bona fide islamophobes do not have a principled disagreement with superstition and human rights abuses as tatchell does they have a raw prejudice against muslims often because they see them as foreign and all secretly sympathetic to the al quaeda psychosis you can see this poison smeared across the pages of the right wing press every day muslims face hefty discrimination in the workplace and wildly disproportionate stop and searches by the police but organisations like islamophobia watch are making many gay people the natural political allies of any minority facing cruel discrimination dismiss all claims of islamophobia as concocted nonsense if tatchell is an islamophobe they say then so am i
4617706 and as for me i am not inclined to take lectures about defending muslims from people who utter not a word in condemnation of the systematic slaughter of gay muslims across the world nor a splutter of condemnation about the violation and battery of muslim women across the world
4617707 since when has being oppressed given anyone the right to oppress others
4617708 you have a problem with the sharia that deals with punishing homosexuals and adulterors but it seems rather superfluous to be even talking about the former because no one is even proposing it
4617709 so true in iran in egypt and in saudi arabia there is no persecution of gay people none
4617710 i mean why dont we provide the same demonisation of judaism christianity hinduism etc in its peoples wrongdoings

4617719 the issue of race is there in political campaigns and not just this one people talk in code it is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that is ignored by mutual agreement so it never gets dealt with head on

4617744 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4617745 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4617746 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4617747 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4617748 for the most part these people have done their time
4617749 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4617750 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse

4617754 no its really hard and im losing my mind the women pulled back from me as if id said i eat babies i felt such shame and remorse and humiliation and i guess thats exactly what they wanted for lynette
4617755 ehhh its like anything else its like any other marriage you sort of stumble along and reconnect and lose each other and reconnect again
4617756 every time bill macy walks into the room my heart still jumps that is true to this day
4617757 people ask me how do you balance being a working mom
4617758 id take a vacation and if i was heavy it was a bad vacation and if i was light or you know lighter it was a good vacation
4617759 oh that was when i weighed 150 and had to wear muumuus
4617760 for some reason after giving birth which is when you look like a bag of doorknobs i actually looked at myself in the mirror and went i look beautiful i dont know why but that sort of tipped it for me
4617761 if this success had happened when i was younger i would have been too tortured to appreciate it
4617762 ive had a lot of trainers through the years and theyre always like oh my god you ate a

4617766 mega man 2 at least once a year its a good reminder of old school game design and to keeps my invisible platforming skills sharpened
4617767 mega man 2 is arguably where the series peaked in terms of design originality and remains a blast to play
4617768 mega man 2 introduced key features to the series that would remain staples to this day
4617769 mega man 2 does not have the slide move or a chargeable buster
4617770 i wish i could turn the clock back no other lender would entertain us we had a bad credit history and the lender knew this but offered us an enormous amount of money which was too good to refuse
4617771 having to leave felt so helpless im letting my family down and feel totally inadequate
4617772 this is going to scar my children for life i fought it for so long and did everything i could but the authorities wouldnt do anything
4617773 weve got two kids and the thought of dragging them onto a plane is not very appealing its also pretty expensive
4617774 if it came to a competition between here and greece or cyprus on the beach they would win but youve got the new forest here theres far more to do than go on the beach

4617777 sterling remains vulnerable especially against the us dollar the pound averaged 1 55 over 1993 2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12 18 months
4617778 the us was the first economy to hit trouble now people are realising that the uk has the same problems if not more so as the us
4617779 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4617780 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4617781 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook if next weeks us inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4617782 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end
4617783 we are absorbing the costs the investment is at the expense of tesco not the farmers
4617784 the supermarkets are telling us they will pay for price cuts out of their own money but we have bitter experience of what happens in the medium to long term
4617785 if farmers cant recoup those increases they will end up not producing next year and if production falls then prices will rise further
4617786 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help
4617787 negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4617788 the fact that prices are going up at shop level does not mean the farmers are getting more
4617789 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4617790 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4617791 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4617792 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4617793 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4617794 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort despite being urged not to
4617795 every day shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4617796 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4617797 it is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4617798 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4617799 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4617800 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4617801 we believe it would be difficult for adecco to improve this offer and justify it to its own shareholders
4617802 there is likely to be short term speculation as to whether adecco will turn its attention to hays or robert walters we would not bank on this given that adecco appeared to be most interested in michael pages brand exposure to permanent recruitment and a specialist model
4617803 given the shares were trading below 250p only five weeks ago the decision by management to reject a 400p cash offer is very brave either they are very upbeat on the outlook for trading or are confident that adecco will return to the table our concern is adecco may shy away from making a higher offer which may struggle to generate a satisfactory return and face shareholder opposition

4617806 the good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks
4617807 a global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year

4617811 the bullish argument from those still buying into commodity stocks is that long term demand for natural resources from emerging markets e
4617812 the mindset is almost as extreme as companies which are close to the consumer in the uk us and europe etc will never be able to make decent returns again meanwhile natural resource stocks make up close to 40 of the weighting in the ftse all share index tracker funds are becoming pseudo natural resources funds the performance of uk equity income funds has been dominated by how much the fund manager has dared to have in natural resources
4617813 i do not feel impelled to dive into the bank sector at all because there is much more value on offer elsewhere in the market
4617814 i dont disagree with the long term view of bill mott but what we are currently going through looks more like a blip than a new trend i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of the big names in the city come back from holidays in september and well then see the market re testing its former lows

4617817 a seismic shift in holiday bookings as spain has been the uks number one choice since the package holiday began
4617818 the brits are taking another look at holidaying at home because of the economic climate
4617819 2006 was a really hot summer that re engaged british holidaymakers with holidaying in britain as opposed to going abroad the trend has continued despite the rather poor summer weve had this year
4617820 people take three or four holidays a year and at least one in the uk has become a fixture
4617821 its more expensive to rent a cottage in devon in august than to get a self catering apartment in turkey
4617822 the credit crunch has affected our customers priorities in terms of booking a summer break as they now demand greater value than ever before customers are either staying in the uk with one of our major clients seeing bookings up 55 year on year or are going to non euro destinations where the pound is strong
4617823 with all these europeans coming over and britons staying at home its getting pretty busy on the beaches

4617831 tobias wolff often presents struggles between innocence and cynicism between slow talking carefulness and quick witted restlessness
4617832 sometimes wolff allows his characters a little last paragraph consolation or revenge every so often though theres a moment of almost religious release
4617833 great is an overused word but tobias wolff justifies it
4617834 our story begins is an essential book which demonstrates the enduring talent of a truly great writer
4617835 like peter ackroyd catharine arnold believes the true story of a city is found at its fringes
4617836 the history of bedlam reminds us of the terrible pains of madness and the continual failures of treatment and care
4617837 her last book was a history of londons necropolis railway and she admits in her introduction that her interest in bethlehem or bethlem as it is generally known stems partly from my own experiences of bereavement and depression and a doomed relationship with a young man whose life was blighted by severe mental illness such sensitivity means that her history is rarely sensationalist and often admirably sympathetic
4617838 longlisted for the booker prize from a to x is a novel containing letters from a woman named aida to her lover xavier who is serving a life sentence for being involved in a terrorist group
4617839 the epistolary format always makes character building difficult but the task is even tougher here because we have only one side of the exchange even more problematic is aidas sermonising her self regarding tone her most pressing concern is not her lovers wellbeing but the need to be profound which she isnt
4617840 the enemy is likewise generic military junta civil war or laissez faire capitalism theres nothing much wrong with bergers writing the problem is in the deep phoniness of the whole conception its gross sentimentality all faceless oppressors and noble peasants its self intoxicated portentousness everyone aida encounters seems to have an unbreakable spirit and a quiet dignity in suffering every object is charged with significance every moment an epiphany theres a name for this sort of thing and its bollocks
4617841 were not going to get caught in the trap of trying to provide a social experience
4617842 we risk drawing people for the wrong reasons and thats not our core competency
4617843 its more about developing long lasting relationships with the music and these people its not so much about access to cheap tickets
4617844 we want to encourage the next generation of community leaders to be involved with the arts
4617845 its a mistake to get too hung up on age
4617846 if the average age of our audience was 30 we wouldnt be raising 2 5 million a year from gifts wed be out of business if that was the case
4617847 there is a distinction between creating access for everyone versus creating access for a group of people who want to have that network and value that education and volunteerism
4617848 you dont have to be 65 and have dumped a lot of dollars to have an impact on an organization
4617849 betting whether or not youll get a lot of money out of these people later on in life is like trying to project what the economic forecast is going to be in 40 50 years
4617850 the core large donors the people who give the really high seven eight figures are the people who will always be the target donors for orchestras and those people arent poor in their 20s typically
4617851 theres something out of control and excessive nobody knows how to behave manners are a thing of the past
4617852 your band are lovely youre the only ones helping us the ones that made most mess theyre asleep all over the hall they came in from the woods and crashed old mrs cobb has got a cob on things have been broken were worried when the owner comes back hes away for long periods at a time well get the blame
4617853 dont you think cleaning up is good for the hangover
4617854 there is no second place you win or you lose
4617855 this 20 minute race will define you for the rest of your lives win or lose
4617856 little do i realise that my experience as ethnographer will prove among the least useful
4617857 and that my survival within the squad will come to hinge critically on my skills in conflict resolution
4617858 everything that i am not virility masculinity youth beauty foolishness
4617859 to tell you the truth it annoyed me about him
4617860 to what extent were you trying to rebel against traditional literary form
4617861 when you go there you dont feel that people despair
4617862 so thats just going to have to remain a mystery for all those dylanologists
4617863 my reflex action was to say thank you very much but no it had been so many years that id shut the door but the way he presented it was what was it like as a young girl to come from the family i came from and end up in the village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes that was something to think about then my son said people have been writing a version of you for years its time you told the real one it suddenly made sense
4617864 when he started out as a performer he was playful a combination of woody guthrie and harpo marx with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient
4617865 he used that playfulness to draw the audience in with the passing of time the technique was no longer required the audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage a sense of humour however was always his strong suit
4617866 right from the start i couldnt take my eyes off her
4617867 she was the most erotic thing id ever seen she was fair skinned and golden haired full blood italian we started talking and my head started to spin she was just my type
4617868 situations have ended sad relationships have all been bad mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
4617869 i felt i was reading a book of revelations lessons warnings
4617870 even though picasso was a much older man than bob and had experienced a lot more their personalities were so similar that it was astounding
4617871 he sat still and quiet didnt even jiggle his leg
4617872 people ask was this song written for you well i could say this and that i could make a list but if you really listen to those songs theyre somewhat like fiction hes written something coming from his life but he sets it in a fiction maybe using another characters voice
4617873 i can recognise things its like looking at a diary it brings it all back and whats hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go his mine anybodys so from the perspective of an older person looking back you enjoy them but also think of them as the pain of youth the loneliness and the struggle that youth is or may be
4617874 i could see that he was an artist at work
4617875 i was a young girl of my time i was shy and timid and i would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do if a girl did that it would mean that she was alone she wasnt with somebody she was an easy woman it would take a lot of courage to do it and when you did it you took a chance
4617876 he had this intensity about him and you got sucked in
4617877 i certainly felt that as his girlfriend i disappeared and became a nonentity even if he didnt see me that way thats what happened that was always a struggle
4617878 there are people who say that he was not a good guy he was manipulative he was this that and the other i tend to see it as you are what you are he could be a shit like anybody else but a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted because nobody was in a position to tell you no everybodys yessing you and everybody wants a piece of you so what do you do
4617879 and there are no residual hurt feelings i think shes an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it and to everybody else the hell with you which men could do easily she went out and got what she wanted and then he in turn did it for her and then he didnt that was him going after what he wanted with no baggage he never looked back he just kept going
4617880 it was the hardest thing to write about i was young and vulnerable and insecure there were pressures from all around and i couldnt find my place any more i didnt feel i had anybody i could turn to that makes you really fall apart and thats how i felt
4617881 only four people in new york know what that means he makes guitars
4617882 but its true so it doesnt go from page to page but the emotion that i managed to find is true
4617883 negligently acted for his own and azans personal financial gain by ensuring that ben did not have an experienced family member to assist ben and oversee all of his matters
4617884 the negligence and dishonesty of the defendant has caused the plaintiff considerable financial hardship personal stress and inconvenience
4617885 totally out of his depth in this very sophisticated international sports arena
4617886 will be fighting this vehemently they do not believe there is any truth to any of the allegations
4617887 this claim is frivolous unmeritorious and an abuse of process of this honourable court
4617888 as dependent on adult direction and advice as the average six or seven year old
4617889 its good to see us continue to keep kyle davies on regular starts although its not where hed like it to be but i feel sure well see him at some point in time again
4617890 he can pitch and he could have pitched the night before he should be good to go
4617891 the thing that i liked when he was up here although he didnt get extensive work was that his plane was almost always downhill
4617892 most often than not he had tilt to the slider and i was impressed with his focus and his concentration
4617893 we were able to get all of the guys that we really wanted to sign
4617894 our scouts did a great job of getting a lot of them signed early on
4617895 ive been failed by every single service that was supposed to help me apart from the haven sexual assault referral centre a confidential service in south london
4617896 i did my bit in reporting a rapist and the authorities didnt do theirs instead they made my life hell it has exhausted me
4617897 i thought if i take this money every penny of it will be tainted
4617898 to discover that the police had lost the file was the worst time in all of it
4617899 ill never get that time back i havent had a job i dont know if ill ever be able to work full time before i got my award i was living in poverty in a council flat i was unable to furnish
4617900 ive lost most of my friends its destroyed my social life ive lost those really important years the years when everyone else builds a career and finds a boyfriend and gets a dog
4617901 im going to end up using the money i fought so hard for to continue doing other peoples bloody jobs
4617902 im leaving on a jet plane i dont know when ill be back again oh babe i hate to go
4617903 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4617904 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
4617905 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
4617906 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
4617907 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
4617908 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
4617909 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
4617910 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
4617911 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4617912 opera is not high on the agenda of many young men so we thought it might be interesting to see what would happen if we met them on a beach and whether they could make the art form relevant to their lives
4617913 their jaws dropped and their eyes opened wide when the singers performed a few feet from them
4617914 its a great project the singers are amazing i was blown away
4617915 the point is that she doesnt give up she keeps going
4617916 i think getting them out of inland communities and to the beach has opened up a lot of reflectiveness being close to the sea can do that
4617917 i think its been life changing for some of them theyve had their eyes opened to many possibilities
4617918 of course its just a stepping stone my dream is not to get drafted in the first round my dream is to play in the big leagues so its a dream come true but at the same time i still have work to do to get here and where i want to be
4617919 i will hopefully test it out a little more on sunday and see how it goes
4617920 its like not even there as an everyday thing when i work out you dont even feel it
4617921 but the explosive arm speed of gearing it up and letting it go thats when it gets me its been very frustrating i can do anything else but when i try to pitch and throw the way i throw i cant perform
4617922 but this has been very hard and frustrating to have it in the back of my mind uh oh is it going to do it again when i get on the mound
4617923 do i really have to hit the white ball first
4617924 galleries are usually nervous about painting activities because of the inevitable mess
4617925 but we have turned this upside down and gone completely hands on
4617926 a lot depends on the weather if its good then you have a good chance of seeing various types of species
4617927 i gave up my place at university to help my dad when our mother was dying
4617928 it was my sister who was already halfway through her degree who carried on having fun and gaining the qualifications i never acquired i know it wasnt her fault but i didnt want to leave my parents at that time i feel ive never caught up i have this dead end job and no relationship she has the kids the house the career it makes me boil
4617929 i hated my sister for being ill for getting all the attention sometimes i wished it was me who was ill because at least my parents would take notice of me and all the time my sister was sweet and uncomplaining you can imagine how guilty that makes me feel
4617930 the thing about amanda is that shes just not my type of person she was always so needy so mollycoddled her favourite expression is its all right for you as though i was born with all the advantages which is simply not true when shes in a blame her big sister mood she physically lashes out and yet when i was ill last year in canada she flew to montreal to be with me go figure do i love her well i suppose i do but i dont like her much
4617931 and what about her successful career as a childrenswear designer and the 38 year marriage thats still going strong and the three great kids and the grandchildren and the huge house i think that stacks up pretty well against my two broken marriages my flat that may be fab but would fit on to one floor of her place and my one wonderful son though id rather have liked to have three like her
4617932 im terribly miserable this in reference to a boyfriend i want to tell you everything that happened i wish i could talk to you properly
4617933 oh sue i really do miss you i just wish i had someone to talk to not about anything special but just to talk
4617934 why dont you want to kill one another like normal sisters
4617935 you are not reaching the levels you should in english mathematics and science and this means you are not well prepared for your next stage of education nor your future adult lives
4617936 these letters often over simplify the outcomes of inspections and in doing so misrepresent the findings
4617937 the letters in effect give licence to pupils to question the professionalism of the school and its staff
4617938 where schools involve their pupils in sharing the key messages of the letter sensitively and openly they are a valuable tool in engaging pupils in both the inspection and subsequent school improvement
4617939 we have been waiting for this since birth its top class
4617940 weve had the shit kicked out of us for 30 years in hull until recently it was difficult to find a story that didnt mention hull and crap in the same sentence but in the past 12 months thanks in part to what has happened on the football pitch were finally seeing the words hull and success in the same story
4617941 im not starry eyed not everything is bright and rosy in the garden
4617942 weve come a long way but there is still a lot to do we just have to keep on moving in the right direction
4617943 if i had the choice to live in hull or go to london id stay in hull definitely
4617944 opera is not high on the agenda of many young men so we thought it might be interesting to see what would happen if we met them on a beach and whether they could make the art form relevant to their lives
4617945 their jaws dropped and their eyes opened wide when the singers performed a few feet from them
4617946 its a great project the singers are amazing i was blown away
4617947 the point is that she doesnt give up she keeps going
4617948 i think getting them out of inland communities and to the beach has opened up a lot of reflectiveness being close to the sea can do that
4617949 i think its been life changing for some of them theyve had their eyes opened to many possibilities
4617950 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up the uk is fast becoming the obesity capital of the world and the effect of spiralling obesity amongst children is particularly worrying
4617951 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services
4617952 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4617953 hero needs to be at her music lesson in an hour and shed like her hair cut
4617954 thats how i feel when you turn up looking glamorous
4617955 ive been failed by every single service that was supposed to help me apart from the haven sexual assault referral centre a confidential service in south london
4617956 i did my bit in reporting a rapist and the authorities didnt do theirs instead they made my life hell it has exhausted me
4617957 i thought if i take this money every penny of it will be tainted
4617958 to discover that the police had lost the file was the worst time in all of it
4617959 ill never get that time back i havent had a job i dont know if ill ever be able to work full time before i got my award i was living in poverty in a council flat i was unable to furnish
4617960 ive lost most of my friends its destroyed my social life ive lost those really important years the years when everyone else builds a career and finds a boyfriend and gets a dog
4617961 im going to end up using the money i fought so hard for to continue doing other peoples bloody jobs
4617962 the evidence strongly suggests that there is next to no chance of people in sunderland having the same opportunities as the people of birmingham or portsmouth
4617963 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland
4617964 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4617965 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
4617966 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
4617967 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
4617968 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
4617969 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
4617970 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
4617971 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
4617972 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4617973 a sideshow solution to a major problem of fertility and family stability
4617974 the answer is more fertile high capital families which come from high capital fathers and mothers
4617975 our research shows that monogamy is key to the stability of the family and that the intact married family that worships weekly is the greatest generator of human capital
4617976 the evidence that fragmented families are bad for children is actually quite patchy much of it is not gathered in the way that the really pukka research is done which is to take a hypothesis and then gather evidence to test that rather than to back it up
4617977 im not saying single parents dont do a great job of bringing up their children
4617978 but ive seen more evidence of families with two loving parents producing people who are confident can concentrate and take in the skills required for a productive life
4617979 its not to say i dont recognise completely how diversity in all shapes and forms can help build a more coherent society for us
4617980 not everybody has to look or be or think the same
4617981 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
4617982 we need a fundamental shift in the working behaviour of both men and women in which men work less so women can work more
4617983 research shows companies with more than three women on their executive boards post 30 more earnings than those with all or mostly male boards
4617984 but in environments where its difficult to have flexible working arrangements its still hard for women to get into these positions
4617985 i used to think we were like a salmon swimming upstream but now businesses are coming to us
4617986 theyve invested a lot in their female employees and if they want to retain their best people as well as attract others they have to think beyond traditional ways of working
4617987 women are doing very well in the digital and hr sectors of british companies though thats still not sufficient
4617988 but despite all the rhetoric i think theres a pretty good situation in the uk market at the moment
4617989 its not enough for them just to be friendly towards employees families
4617990 they need to react to the familys changing needs at different stages of life the employees family are the new company stakeholders and should be treated accordingly
4617991 it takes a long time to build a high capital culture and as we have seen it can be torn down in a short time
4617992 i sort of knew when i came eer ze liverpool or arshenal one of zem we would draw we have a young team and to expereinsh bigggggg games he holds out his hands in a manner common to footballers denoting a particularly large pair of breasts championsh leeegue at home ze emirates will be fantasteeec for ze playez

4617994 please dont call me arrogant but im european champion and i think im a special one
4617995 yes i am special for my friends my family my country but as a manager so so
4617996 the speed is slower there is an imitation of phonological features he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check hes understood hes giving equal stress to each word this is classical trying to make yourself understood to a foreigner english its typical of the way english people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability
4617997 ten out of 10 for effort but there is a way of speaking slowly and clearly that doesnt make it sound as if youre treating them like idiots
4617998 i couldnt settle in italy it was like living in a foreign country
4617999 that squatch in the photo is pretty ripped good set of six packs a bit man boobish though
4618000 do you think no such critique is necessary or has there been one you prefer over this

4618007 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4618008 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4618009 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4618010 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4618011 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4618012 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4618013 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4618014 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4618015 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4618016 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
4618017 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
4618018 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4618019 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4618020 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
4618021 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
4618022 they also want to avoid a scenario where shes leading at any point
4618023 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4618024 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4618025 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4618026 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4618027 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4618028 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4618029 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour
4618030 i guess that coming from a kind of sister country australia theres a good vibe
4618031 i didnt like the way we got here but the end result is mutually beneficial for both sides
4618032 takes the lid off everything the torturers can now excite themselves by finding out how it feels to gouge out an old mans eyes
4618033 i dont think youll be like me i think youll be more like your grandad

4618035 hero needs to be at her music lesson in an hour and shed like her hair cut
4618036 thats how i feel when you turn up looking glamorous
4618037 dont get me started a noxious piece of tudor propaganda good quotes though
4618038 weve got two kids and the thought of dragging them onto a plane is not very appealing its also pretty expensive
4618039 if it came to a competition between here and greece or cyprus on the beach they would win but youve got the new forest here theres far more to do than go on the beach
4618040 i havent had a holiday in the uk for a long time you realise you dont need to go abroad
4618041 the action is surprising the community in blackburn is mainstream any act of terrorism not only does it give a bad name to islam and muslims it has an adverse reaction on race relations
4618042 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us
4618043 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4618044 they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4618045 they were quite a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4618046 brilliant attempt but just outside medal position hopes for gold tragically dashed things just didnt go right for the british team there luck as important as skill in this event

4618050 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4618051 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral

4618058 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4618059 the bnps attempts to present a respectable image are still masking some deeply disturbing underlying views
4618060 there is a gypsy problem there whats wrong with people who talk frankly about their problems
4618061 the system is not set in stone im open to reform long term there are a number of things were looking at the making good progress pilot is one of those but it would be wrong to rush into a change straight away
4618062 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009
4618063 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4618064 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing
4618065 and dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4618066 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4618067 and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning it means we havent lost an officer overnight
4618068 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight
4618069 afghanistan isnt like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective
4618070 this is not burma or thailand or mexico or colombia this is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction its so fragile and corruption is such an issue that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country destroying this government and pushing the nation into big time civil disorder why because you have so many people who can get so many weapons its entirely different im telling you
4618071 im sitting there thinking james bond and women and adventure so i called the toll free number
4618072 you actually had these guys on the streets wearing their big brimmed hats and fancy long coats and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls it was amazing just like you see on tv
4618073 from the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later they were wrong
4618074 theres got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law corruption and drugs otherwise you can forget it
4618075 its roundup my dad puts it on his weeds it doesnt mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in
4618076 we are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks
4618077 the owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood
4618078 there are a lot of wealthy people in afghanistan but the money is not here
4618079 getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in its about making sure innocent people are not in prison
4618080 it was just a way for him to get me out
4618081 none of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years they obviously did what they had to do americans want to think black and white but you gotta throw that out the window when you come to afghanistan everything here is a shade of grey
4618082 i have thoroughly investigated all these accusations and of course none of them are true
4618083 but we do not have good relations if i was governor the taliban would not have captured even five inches of land now they have five districts
4618084 that bastard bus driver coulda dropped us at the ranch

4618106 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding
4618107 were still working at it but we just dont have that much new
4618108 we have no record that he was ever any trouble on this campus
4618109 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up the uk is fast becoming the obesity capital of the world and the effect of spiralling obesity amongst children is particularly worrying
4618110 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services
4618111 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4618112 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4618113 was forced to adapt to a fast moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained lessons were learned the hard way
4618114 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff
4618115 facing a task for which it was not originally designed
4618116 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4618117 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4618118 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4618119 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4618120 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4618121 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4618122 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4618123 they say there are 10 shots in a headfucker but theres only vodka gin bacardi orange juice and grenadine
4618124 weve seen some trouble but were here for a laugh the drink is watered down but i drink as much as i can sensibly
4618125 theyre kids here and what they want to do here is normal for kids its just 3 000 people enjoying themselves at night it would be much worse if we had 3 000 greek people getting drunk here they would kill each other
4618126 if you buy one drink and get five free i dont think you can expect to get the good stuff and if you drink a lot of cheap alcohol you do stupid things
4618127 the biggest problem is people on quadbikes who have never ridden them before they kill themselves
4618128 i take my wife and sons to eat outside malia in the summertime none of my sons uses their bikes i take them in the car because of the quadbikes
4618129 lots of the tourists do not respect that we live here its like a carnival they dress up like clowns and go around like jerks and spoil the picture of this place for the whole of greece and europe
4618130 thats how it should be in england its much safer here
4618131 people think its going to be all sex but its not
4618132 if you go looking for a fight you can find one anywhere i think southends worse
4618133 ive been failed by every single service that was supposed to help me apart from the haven sexual assault referral centre a confidential service in south london
4618134 i did my bit in reporting a rapist and the authorities didnt do theirs instead they made my life hell it has exhausted me
4618135 i thought if i take this money every penny of it will be tainted
4618136 to discover that the police had lost the file was the worst time in all of it
4618137 ill never get that time back i havent had a job i dont know if ill ever be able to work full time before i got my award i was living in poverty in a council flat i was unable to furnish
4618138 ive lost most of my friends its destroyed my social life ive lost those really important years the years when everyone else builds a career and finds a boyfriend and gets a dog
4618139 im going to end up using the money i fought so hard for to continue doing other peoples bloody jobs
4618140 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4618141 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4618142 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4618143 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4618144 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4618145 there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
4618146 consumers are showing a preference for self service kiosk activity of all kinds
4618147 we are not human beings having a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having a human experience
4618148 remnants of living coral that have fallen from coral reefs as a result of wave action or other natural processes according to the coral calcium infomercial taking coral calcium can cure up to 200 human diseases including heart disease
4618149 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4618150 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4618151 you can think about american idol in terms of the process
4618152 everyone will get a chance to participate and vote it is a filtered collaboration so that we will have the best possible work at the end
4618153 this is a great opportunity to bring together computer graphics with the creativity of both hollywood and the facebook community
4618154 intel processor performance and facebook sharing and communication tools enable large numbers of people around the globe to collaborate on a single creative endeavor
4618155 if we manage to tell a good story and introduce compelling characters through this lets see if we can do for instance a feature length project
4618156 if it is also a good user experience then i think we will do a bunch of things this way
4618157 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
4618158 many buyers with long term expectations are getting exceptional value in the current market once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising todays buyers are very well positioned to build wealth over time
4618159 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4618160 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4618161 each of these areas has seen a strong buyer response in recent months to the big cuts in home prices
4618162 areas with affordable housing and healthy local economies continue to see price growth
4618163 prices having fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets
4618164 furthermore the momentum of buying is likely to continue in light of the housing stimulus package that was recently enacted about 2 5 million first time buyers are expected to take advantage of the 7 500 tax credit between now and the middle of next year
4618165 as a father to his children he will always be the ultimate role model
4618166 despite hundreds of millions of pounds spent each year on uk drug enforcement activity there is remarkably little evidence of its effectiveness in disrupting markets and reducing availability

4618170 yes i am special for my friends my family my country but as a manager so so
4618171 the speed is slower there is an imitation of phonological features he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check hes understood hes giving equal stress to each word this is classical trying to make yourself understood to a foreigner english its typical of the way english people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability

4618174 it might actually have been useful considering two men with schizophrenia escaped from a mental hospital near exeter on tuesday night and everyones been very scared

4618200 the brits are taking another look at holidaying at home because of the economic climate
4618201 2006 was a really hot summer that re engaged british holidaymakers with holidaying in britain as opposed to going abroad the trend has continued despite the rather poor summer weve had this year
4618202 people take three or four holidays a year and at least one in the uk has become a fixture
4618203 its more expensive to rent a cottage in devon in august than to get a self catering apartment in turkey
4618204 the credit crunch has affected our customers priorities in terms of booking a summer break as they now demand greater value than ever before customers are either staying in the uk with one of our major clients seeing bookings up 55 year on year or are going to non euro destinations where the pound is strong

4618255 we know we dont have a systemic problem with maintenance and safety but some of the stuff were seeing published is pretty crazy
4618256 the cost pressures in every legacy carrier are just as intense as in qantas
4618257 all well established carriers have therefore increased the risk levels associated with maintenance throughout the world over the last decade
4618258 given that qantas had a leading position 10 years as the worlds safest then in all honesty it is probably still there
4618259 whats playing out is the tension of outsourcing everything and the timely and quality maintenance that was traditionally done by airlines
4618260 it just means that someone didnt lock it down properly before take off
4618261 legally qantas did not have to replace it and they could have flown on without a problem

4618310 i know that before i can win your vote i have to win your respect
4618311 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4618312 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4618313 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4618314 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4618315 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4618316 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4618317 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4618318 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there
4618319 i think it would be to his advantage to speak more to those kinds of voters and when i think he does that he always does very well
4618320 i think we will see him do more of that as we go through this year

4618326 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4618327 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4618328 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4618329 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4618330 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4618331 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4618332 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4618333 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4618334 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4618335 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4618336 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4618337 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4618338 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4618339 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4618340 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4618341 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4618342 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4618343 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4618344 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4618345 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4618346 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4618347 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4618348 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4618349 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4618350 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4618351 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4618352 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4618353 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4618354 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4618355 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4618356 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4618357 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4618358 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4618359 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4618372 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4618373 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4618374 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4618375 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4618376 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4618377 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

4618382 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4618383 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4618384 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4618385 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

4618391 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

4618512 surely no lord nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth
4618513 do not call anything impure that god has made clean

4618515 as i began to speak the holy spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning then i remembered what the lord had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit so if god gave them the same gift as he gave us who believed in the lord jesus christ who was i to think that i could oppose god

4618526 cada um na sua eu estava bastante nervosa e precisava de algo para me relaxar eu ou o os livros de harry potter porque a minha mente viaja para um mundo m gico e foi timo porque consegui manter os nervos sob controle
4618527 i worked for a producer who wore a chicken fat stained homburg and a black alpaca coat he pounced on little old ladies and would make love to them they gave him money for his plays and they were so grateful for his attention later on there were a couple of guys who were doing flop after flop and living like kings a press agent told me god forbid they should ever get a hit because theyd never be able to pay off the backers i coupled the producer with these two crooks and bang there was my story
4618528 it was such a delicious scheme and i said to myself so what is the flop theyve got to make a surefire flop one that simply cant run but what would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over well how about something about hitler how about a musical a gay romp with adolf and eva in the berchtesgaden well that would certainly send the jews flying out of the theatre so thats what i called my script springtime for hitler
4618529 i only had eight weeks to get it all in the can including a big production number springtime for hitler
4618530 sidney glazier was the only producer who would do this
4618531 sidney went to a guy called louis wolfson a rich philanthropist he also was a great racetrack enthusiast so he was a gambler and when he heard my idea he said oh good this is getting back at hitler you cant bring dictators down on a soapbox with rhetoric but if you can make people laugh at them youve won he put up half the money it cost 941 000 to make the other half was put up by a producer called joseph e levine who said ill do it if you change the title thats when we decided to call it the producers
4618532 i found gene in a bertolt brecht play called mother courage my wife anne bancroft was starring in it and gene and i got to be friends hed say why do people laugh at me i said because youre a funny guy he said but i dont intend to be funny i said thats what comedy is all about having the audience discover it so i said im writing this script and youre going to be leo bloom he said ha ha thatll be the day then two years later i went back to him by that time he had become a star but he read the script and cried gene was nuts crazy i loved gene because he was always an inch and a half away from hysteria it was right there in his eyes he was like a trapped animal and in the producers max bialystock is the thing thats trapping him
4618533 i knew it was always zero mostel that had to play max bialystock who else would pounce on old ladies to get the last dollar out of them but zero wouldnt do it now in those days i was part of a club called the tuesday night gourmet club and we would meet at chinese restaurants it consisted of speed vogel a clothing merchant and sculptor and george mandel a novelist who was best friends with joseph heller and joseph heller was very good friends with mario puzo speed knew zeros wife because they had a loft together where speed sculpted and zero painted and speed knew kate zeros irish wife he said kate would love this we gotta get it to kate so he gave her the script she loved it and she made zero do it she said no more sex or something
4618534 peter sellers was a champion of the producers and he nearly ruined it it was about to open in england and he took out a double page ad in the sunday times that said this is the funniest and the best picture ever made the critics said hmm well be the judges of that thank you so i got good and bad reviews because they decided that they would judge it for themselves and not just take peter sellers word for it
4618535 i only got one really great review at the time and that was no one will be seated during the last 88 minutes theyll all be on the floor laughing oh and someone at newsweek said it was best lunatic humour since the marx brothers invaded the opera but word of mouth floated it and the next year i found myself at the oscars why i dont know i was just lucky i was up against stanley kubricks 2001 i was up against the battle of algiers i said forget it but sure enough when frank sinatra was giving out the award he said best original screenplay mel brooks i got up and i took the award and i said i must tell you all whats deep in my heart whats really in my heart they waited and i said ba dum ba dum ba dum and then i left
4618536 the first review god bless the critics was by renata adler in the new york times she crucified it she said it was a lousy picture not worth seeing and when you do a little arts picture like that you need the times you cant survive without it i dont know what kept that movie alive i mean it wasnt a doris day rock hudson movie it was definitely bizarre who would go see a film about hitler and two jews trying to outsmart their investors who cares about that
4618537 not really they brought a lot of this on themselves and maybe they will learn a lesson or two

4618879 and the ghost who threw your platform shoe at me while i was sleeping
4618880 im not sure how my parents feel i imagine the chelsea is not what they had in mind but that its no big deal its not as if were living in a yurt
4618881 i know there are many people who wouldnt dream of bringing up their children in a hotel where a large proportion of the people are checking in for the night
4618882 i know some people like to control the environment that children live in they find comfort in predictability because the city is unexpected enough but if you want to live in a sheltered world where theres a doorman and no rogue element you dont check into a hotel what makes you persist even when it doesnt make economic sense is that people who live here deeply connect with it and dont think about things in a traditional way
4618883 there are grandparents whose grandchildren come and visit them and the teenagers next door who weve known since they were kids are our babysitters there are other families in the building so the boys have friends here they go to the local primary school and take part in the usual round of sleepovers parties and adventures in the hallways we also have eccentrics of every description and everyone tolerates it theres that old fashioned communal attitude here
4618884 the whole place is magic but its not a theme park its authentic an organic village in the middle of the city where the people are friendly and fascinating
4618885 with the surrealism of hippie culture the violence of the manson family killings and the sla symbionese liberation army and patty hearst kidnapping happening in our backyard
4618886 wanted to work for warhols interview magazine and wrote him letters i love that whole world the beat generation allen ginsberg gregory corso i was absorbed by the fabulousness of it
4618887 so it was inevitable that this is where i should live
4618888 actually it was my idea to come to the chelsea
4618889 sally made it happen i had the outsiders sense of possibility
4618890 you know some people leave because of the mice some because of the cockroaches and others because of the people in the elevator
4618891 for us it was sheer practicality we thought our life had to assume a more adult size
4618892 having a garden lots of stairs and rooms to run and hide in they loved the ice cream truck that went down the street
4618893 i thought i was living the life that my parents hoped for
4618894 but when i showed them the house they were disappointed theyre so used to coming to see me in seedy neighbourhoods with two rooms and a bed that pulls out of the wall i know many english people think children need gardens country houses to escape to i dont want that i think theres too much stuff in the world youre not light on your feet and cant go at any moment
4618895 if your wife says to you i dont want to live here any more what are the options
4618896 it surprised me how attached i am to the chelsea
4618897 made a feast for 30 we cooked here and moved upstairs to my friend susans for dinner then we went up to geralds top floor apartment which has a roof garden for drinks
4618898 these days to rent and not buy is a radical act we chose to rent this place instead of buying an apartment elsewhere and we dont have anything to show for it a lot of people find that unacceptable
4618899 how do you place a value on happiness youll never have a conversation about real estate in this hotel and thats because the owner stanley bard has created this extraordinary community that reflects his whimsies and his peculiar rather crazed priorities
4618900 this hotel does not belong to america there are no vacuum cleaners no rules and no shame
4618901 during our visit to the palace we came to know that certain quarters were putting pressure on the palace to withdraw consent for the sermons
4618902 the delegation decided that it would not put the palace in an awkward position on the matter and conveyed to the raja muda that both nik aziz and i would not be giving the friday sermons
4618903 the party never asked for it we were invited to give the sermons when we paid a courtesy call on raja nazrin shah we wanted to express our gratitude for the consent given
4618904 that is not true consent was given but the party decided not to complicate matters for the palace because of pressure from certain quarters
4618905 my reply is the same as previously at the magistrates court
4618906 i refuse to enter a plea or respond on the grounds that they the charges are mala fide
4618907 this is a court it is a contempt of court
4618908 disappeared to the chagrin of both parties who charged each other with taking it
4618909 we have pictures of them taking it out of court
4618910 i was told that the order should not be served by the lawyer himself and that it should not be done in a courtroom
4618911 im not hiding so they can serve it on me anywhere
4618912 we will cross the bridge when we come to it i do not want to be a mat jenin
4618913 he must first win the permatang pauh by election followed by changes in representation in parliament
4618914 i have reached the final and that by itself is a triumph as there have been so many upsets in the tournament the pressure was immense but i kept my focus for most of the match
4618915 i couldnt sleep as the semi final preyed on my mind throughout yesterday thursday and today yesterday but i was determined to make it
4618916 having won the first chong wei became impatient and started making mistakes
4618917 it was too wide a lead for me to chase and i felt i would stand a better chance in the decider
4618918 the final means so much to me i have sacrificed so much and this is firstly for me my coach needs it too for he has been a pillar and malaysia needs it because of the support i have been given
4618919 i want to uphold the truth as a muslim malay and malaysian
4618920 i firmly understand the consequences of my action and if it is not true misfortune will befall me my family and my descendants this was the best option for me to seek justice and restore my dignity and self respect
4618921 i dont want to lie or dilly dally any longer i challenge anwar to do the same swear on the quran and deny my allegations against him
4618922 the time is right for me to face the public as a faithful muslim
4618923 when i lodged the police report on june 26 there was no news of anwar contesting in the by election
4618924 i was surprised by the conditions considering this constituency was under a former deputy prime minister who is now the parti keadilan rakyat adviser
4618925 it has also been under pkr for two terms and there are still houses that are neglected
4618926 the first house i went to had a wall missing and only a very small bed
4618927 leaders should go to the ground barisan nasional would provide better leadership and help bring in programmes like housing for the hardcore poor
4618928 just last week when my husband was away undergoing dialysis treatment some people came to the house and told me they would help us fix it
4618929 if there is sufficient evidence we will throw the book at them
4618930 there have been repeated calls by senior police officers for their subordinates to display commitment integrity and loyalty to the force
4618931 their actions are merely destroying the efforts of their colleagues
4618932 overall the performance of the police force has been admirable except for a few rotten apples
4618933 i have also instructed the police disciplinary board to tighten their internal auditing and screening process
4618934 in this case saiful opted for the islamic method it is now up to the people to evaluate what has happened
4618935 we are mature people we wont play dirty we will only explain what we have done we dont want to talk about peoples personal problems
4618936 some of his policies do not sit well with the malays some of which were announced by his leaders like the recent proposal for universiti teknologi mara to open its doors to non bumiputeras
4618937 of course pas will be wary it is as if pas is a wooden horse to be ridden on
4618938 i have a good track record here and the people know what they can expect from me if i am elected i have been doing my rounds in this area since way back and permatang pauh is not new to me
4618939 i was the permatang pauh division youth chief when anwar was heading the division we know each other well i respect him as a friend and i hope we can have a clean contest without personal attacks
4618940 the people here have been under the opposition for the last nine years i believe they want a change and i am ever willing to be a service oriented assemblyman
4618941 it might look tough for us but in the end i am confident that we have a good chance of winning this seat
4618942 we will be facing a daunting task against the bn machinery they have already started attacking us by using a racist approach
4618943 however i am thankful for the strong support shown to me by our fellow pakatan rakyat friends
4618944 i dont have any problems with him on a personal level as a friend but we will be talking about policies in this by election
4618945 the important thing to remember is that there is an understanding with the pas leadership on the pkrs struggle and who will be the prime minister when pakatan rakyat takes over at the federal level
4618946 it is all right i am not slighted by the dissenting voices in pas youth it is normal for hardcore party supporters to express their views in the strongest terms
4618947 our discussions with bn youth leaders from sabah and sarawak showed no indication of their mps hopping to the opposition party
4618948 i dont see the figures of barisan nasional mps crossing over to pkr it is impossible for him to get the figures in the first place
4618949 a follow up raid was conducted in an empty house in taman sri tebrau where 70 eramin 5 pills 12 68g of heroin 2 65g of syabu and 152 ecstasy pills were found
4618950 the first six years have been an encouraging leap forward the next step is to continue attracting quality human capital that can support our aspiration to be an internationally competitive academic and research institution
4618951 we are moving forward and accelerating the development in this sector
4618952 so it is not fair for me to comment but from what i have read before there were articles on poverty social issues and world affairs
4618953 i do not know which article had attracted a lot of attention but the weekly has been publishing articles on politics and social issues
4618954 the article is meant to ask people to pray for malaysians who are going to vote in permatang pauh so that they would make the right decision
4618955 the comfort of their homes without having to post them or coming to government offices
4618956 there is more to politics than just ministerial posts i do miss it but take this phase of my career as a challenge
4618957 i spend more time with my constituents as well as my family at the same time it keeps me occupied
4618958 i am experimenting with vanilla plants to see how well they grow im also trying out orchids in my garden
4618959 i want to pass on what i learn to my constituents who may be keen on going commercial with such crops
4618960 people may call it a sabbatical now that i am no longer an assistant minister but i can prove them wrong
4618961 i was an assistant minister for 14 years and have served many who handed me a wealth of knowledge and experience
4618962 this project runs into the billions and will turn a massive plot of idle land in kimanis into a vibrant area it will change the landscape
4618963 my role here is to make sure we do not become mere spectators of a glorified facility
4618964 this place will be the future of sabah and we need to have a relook at its direction and downstream activities
4618965 i would prefer if we have a refinery or other downstream activities here
4618966 weve already explained our situation to our children when we go out to eat theyve seen how quickly a rm10 note is spent
4618967 they are well behaved now they dont ask for much
4618968 i usually spend between rm15 and rm18 a day on food
4618969 i wouldnt have known how much we spend a month if we didnt do all these calculations
4618970 sometimes im aware that im being very frugal for example i was looking at corn which costs more than rm1 for an ear of corn and i told myself i didnt need it
4618971 but we eat a lot of vegetables and we have fish and eggs for protein
4618972 if they do well in their examinations i try to cook a special meal for them
4618973 but we dont usually have tea and instead of two or three slices of bread in the morning we each have four slices
4618974 at first it was chicken being injected with hormones and later pigs fed with feed laced with beta agonist
4618975 the best is getting fish from the deep sea where there is the least pollution
4618976 all three men carried several identity cards and driving licences each with a different name we are now trying to establish their true identities
4618977 i am very proud that my efforts and sacrifices have been recognised by the police force i did not expect this being paralysed to happen but i accept it and am not dispirited or discouraged
4618978 if anything i am more determined to continue serving the public in whatever capacity i can
4618979 although the credibility of the police force comes under constant scrutiny the commitment and dedication shown by police to the extent of putting their lives on the line prove their loyalty towards their country
4618980 we received instructions to investigate a possible break in near the selayang wholesale market
4618981 we met a security guard at km11 jalan ipoh who said he had noticed two men behaving suspiciously at a shop two blocks away
4618982 at the shop we saw a man standing outside the shop later identified as ng kien tee he refused to produce his identity card when we asked for it and a struggle broke out
4618983 raja petra cannot claim ignorance of the order as he had knowledge that muhammad shafee had obtained the order in court on wednesday
4618984 the event is in the public domain on the content of the order
4618985 we will make sure that cpl juns family gets the best assistance once the assessment is done
4618986 jangan takut ada kapal terbang kau tak sesat selagi pilot tak sesat
4618987 dont worry there is the airplane you wont get lost unless the pilot gets lost
4618988 we hardly go out shopping and most of the time we eat vegetables that emty plants in the garden and meat from the animals that i find in the jungle
4618989 i realise now that it is better to stock up on dried food for rainy days and list down what i need to buy now we can see how much we spend every month
4618990 this is the average amount we spent on food sometimes it is rm450 if the children ask for other types of food
4618991 they know i am the only one working so they dont simply ask for anything once in a while they will ask for fried chicken and if i have extra money for the day ill buy for them
4618992 the doctor told me that for the olympic period there can be no change of ward no transfer between hospitals and no leaving hospital

4618994 we believe this action is a serious violation of the personal rights of mentally ill patients and a severe blow to the olympic spirit of mutual understanding friendship unity and fair competition

4619006 its going to open up and revolutionize the way we use and think about lighting
4619007 its a much more cost effective and much better energy source
4619008 we were founded around the manufacture of incandescent light and that vacuum tube produced other vacuum tubes for radios and picture tubes for tvs
4619009 my parents see me as indian but my friends see me as british i see myself as both british and indian
4619010 its the same kind of relationship you have with your artwork as with your identity
4619011 its not asian artists work its artwork by artists who happen to be asian
4619012 i believe that being an artist is more than being an indian artist i feel supportive to that kind of endeavour it needs to happen once i hope that show is never necessary again
4619013 we simply do not need insulting patronising shows like zerozerozero ever again
4619014 skin colour stopped being a barrier in photography a long time ago
4619015 at the beginning of the 1990s it did feel like the only artist of colour who had gained public recognition was anish kapoor but things have changed dramatically since then there is a kind of multicultural romanticism in the london art world now gallery owners dont have a racial agenda to selling art there are a small few who choose to show only works with a post colonial slant but essentially dealers are interested in the international appeal of their artists in a strange way
4619016 ithe gatekeepers are still white and although you can mention artists like kapoor isaac julien and runa islam i still think theres a kind of tokenism to the way these artists are seen you can argue its a class thing but thats just sidestepping the issue dealers might be keen to attract black and asian artists but i dont see them going into schools in the east end or setting up scholarships

4619033 so everyday theres somebody different having garbage out and trucks coming through and especially with the little one its a little noisy it wakes her up sometimes
4619034 that really is the best way to have it because it protects you from somebody building something next to you or parking big trucks that type of thing
4619035 hopping a freight out of los angeles at high noon
4619036 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4619037 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4619038 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4619039 energy is a property of many substances and is associated with heat light electricity energy is transferred in many ways
4619040 energy can be transferred in many ways in some materials such as metals electrons flow easily whereas in insulating material they can hardly flow at all
4619041 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4619042 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4619043 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4619044 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4619045 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4619046 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4619047 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4619048 with the help of a few bulb gatherers brought from the corning plant he manned his battery of machines with boys from the neighboring farms taught them to handle the equipment and in a surprisingly short time transformed them into a body of efficient workmen
4619049 the full solution of the problem then resolved itself into the designing of a mechanism which would first form the desired blanks and second conduct them with properly maintained temperatures and predetermined speed through the elongating and blowing operations and finally to the finished bulb

4619057 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4619058 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4619059 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case

4619065 last summer i went to a christian festival with the hope of getting ideas of something different i could do with my gap year there i heard a talk by patrick regan the founder of xlp an urban youth charity about working with kids in a disadvantaged area who are not in school within the peckham area of london i was blown away by it and decided i wanted to do that i had hoped to get into cambridge to do medicine and was going to reapply after doing my gap year i thought my gap year would give me a chance to go away and experience something that would contribute to my career as a doctor but a couple of months in i changed my mind it was after seeing the impact of what the charity did working with children on estates who felt alienated from school and society and helping them fulfil their potential seeing these kids changed my perspective on life and i decided that medicine maybe wasnt the right thing for me to do now ive decided to work with the salvation army and do a youth worker degree at spurgeons college in london and study and work around there im really pleased i did the gap year it has changed my life completely i was brought up in a quiet little town so to suddenly be in peckham where there is a knife crime problem and young people are being stabbed really opened my eyes if youve been stuck in the education system its a good idea to take a gap year and experience what life is like in the real world
4619066 ive been working as a healthcare assistant in cardiff since january i had already applied to do the degree and deferred entry having worked over the past several months its confirmed for me that this is what i want to do im really looking forward to going to university it has given me an insight into what it will be like to study nursing now that im doing this im much more confident about going on to university this time out has given me the chance to get first hand experience i wanted to do something that would help me in the future rather than just the travel thing some of my friends have gone travelling but theyve done it for a reason such as a medical programme or something that will help their jobs during my time as a healthcare assistant ive had to work on a portfolio which will be good practice for my degree i get paid 6 an hour which im saving for when i go to university it takes six months to qualify as a healthcare assistant and two months to do the portfolio after that i think my pay goes up and i get a new uniform i would definitely advise other students to use their gap year to road test a degree or career even if youve already applied for university its a good move to get deferred entry and see what opportunities are out there everyone thinks that a gap year is all about travelling but its not the only thing to do
4619067 robbing peter to supply paul is how we like to describe it most 100 green tariffs are a con because they tell you youll reduce your carbon footprint etc but dont tell you someone elses will go up as a direct result nothing really changes its just a redistribution of existing green sources
4619068 we will spend around 1bn on new renewable projects in the next two years including europes biggest windfarm whitelee near glasgow our renewable portfolio will be 10 of our capacity by 2010
4619069 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort despite being urged not to
4619070 every day shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4619071 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4619072 it is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4619073 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4619074 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4619075 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4619076 the bullish argument from those still buying into commodity stocks is that long term demand for natural resources from emerging markets e
4619077 the mindset is almost as extreme as companies which are close to the consumer in the uk us and europe etc will never be able to make decent returns again meanwhile natural resource stocks make up close to 40 of the weighting in the ftse all share index tracker funds are becoming pseudo natural resources funds the performance of uk equity income funds has been dominated by how much the fund manager has dared to have in natural resources
4619078 i do not feel impelled to dive into the bank sector at all because there is much more value on offer elsewhere in the market
4619079 i dont disagree with the long term view of bill mott but what we are currently going through looks more like a blip than a new trend i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of the big names in the city come back from holidays in september and well then see the market re testing its former lows

4619095 its a great doc and part of it even delves into some los angeles history militant approved
4619096 el tc emiti una sentencia en el denominado caso condori condori que es un proceso de h beas corpus y que s lo es aplicable a este caso en concreto pero es evidente que el tc va generando precedentes constitucionales con ese tipo de sentencias y lo que se dice es que la ley 29182 la ley vigente de organizaci n y funciones de la justicia militar es inconstitucional en la parte en que insiste en que un juez militar puede ser a la vez oficial en situaci n de actividad
4619097 el considerando 7 de esta sentencia dice lo siguiente constituye la ley 29182 un abierto desacato a los pronunciamientos del tc y adem s supone una suerte de rebeld a legislativa dado que el congreso incumple su deber constitucional de legislar sobre una materia respecto a la cual el tc ya se ha pronunciado haciendo caso omiso a lo antes decidido y por tanto el tc considera que debe inaplicarse la ley 29182 en el caso concreto porque vulnera la constituci n espec ficamente la garant a del juez imparcial
4619098 de manera que ya hay un pronunciamiento del tc declarando inconstitucional en parte es verdad pero resuelve un tema central la condici n esta de oficial en situaci n de actividad de los jueces militares creemos que este es un paso important simo para que nuevamente el congreso se pronuncie sobre esta ley la modifique y de una vez la adecue de acuerdo a la jurisprudencia del tc
4619099 esta resoluci n jur dicamente tiene efectos para ese tema en concreto y no tiene todav a este efecto derogatorio que s tendr a una demanda de inconstitucionalidad con este antecedente ser a importante que los rganos legitimados constitucionalmente para interponer una demanda de inconstitucional con efecto general lo hagan me estoy refiriendo al ministerio p blico la defensor a del pueblo los colegios de abogados porque ya hay un precedente constitucional que declara inconstitucional en parte la 29182
4619100 estas diferencias y pugnas al interior del tc son sin duda una mala se al de una instituci n que deber a inspirar la confianza y credibilidad de todos los sectores m s all de que estemos de acuerdo o no con algunas de sus sentencias este tipo de hechos y de rumores no ayudan deber a ser el mismo presidente del tribunal constitucional carlos mes a quien aclare este tema lo exhortamos a que despeje todo este tipo de rumores que sinceramente no ayudan al tribunal constitucional y se suma a la salida intempestiva de c sar landa
4619101 yo quisiera exhortar al presidente del tc carlos mes a a aclarar este asunto porque este esc ndalo no le alegra a ning n sector porque desacredita a una instituci n que ha sido reconocida nacional e internacionalmente por el buen desempe o que hizo despu s de recuperarse la democracia

4619103 modern day adventurers who take on exciting and often dangerous trips for the benefit of others
4619104 youll stand out from the other graduates if you organised your own trip advertised what you were doing and thought up something really different you are bound to impress employers
4619105 the idea was appealing because the country crosses so many different terrains theres patagonia in the south then the middle is mediterranean in climate and the north is dry we literally got a map and pointed and said well go from there to there
4619106 we were a bit naive when we started out we had to take the pedals off our bikes to get them on the plane and we put them back on wrongly and had to find someone to sort our bikes out as soon as we got there we were very confident travellers by the end though
4619107 we realised that our bikes were ill equipped for the terrain although they were new then the patagonian wind whipped everything off the bikes so wed be chasing around for our sleeping bags and tents
4619108 we would meet quite a few long distance cyclists on our route which was fun one of the main things we got to appreciate was how fantastic it was to cycle everywhere you get invited to sleep in peoples homes in churches and in schools it was the best way to see somewhere and it was cheap
4619109 it cost us less than 2 000 together in flights bikes and living costs
4619110 we got great satisfaction from planning the adventure ourselves but i made sure i spoke to plenty of experts we asked long distance cyclists one of whom literally turned up on my doorstep to tell me his tips i emailed people i found who had done similar things
4619111 the penguins moult like dogs and it was breeding season so all the chicks were hatching the penguins couldnt go into the sea while they moulted so they couldnt get food to feed their chicks we rescued hundreds of chicks and gave them a health check
4619112 we were invited to release the birds back into the sea when they had been rehabilitated
4619113 i went on my own and met people out there i wanted to organise my gap year adventure myself inventing your own itinerary and planning your year yourself gives you a sense of independence it was also a lot cheaper that way
4619114 we had lost three stone each and it took about five to six weeks to recover
4619115 above 8 000m your body starts to break down and the cells dont replace themselves i looked like an eight year old
4619116 we had a focal point and then it was all over leaving us feeling awful
4619117 years ago i wouldnt have fallen through the ice because it wouldnt have been so thin
4619118 you might be more likely to get sponsorship and you might get local press coverage
4619119 the big corporates get approached by so many people i sent 150 letters and i got two hits
4619120 i had to work hard to convince people i was passionate about the charity they thought i just wanted to do the trip and should pay for it myself
4619121 you are not reaching the levels you should in english mathematics and science and this means you are not well prepared for your next stage of education nor your future adult lives
4619122 these letters often over simplify the outcomes of inspections and in doing so misrepresent the findings
4619123 the letters in effect give licence to pupils to question the professionalism of the school and its staff
4619124 where schools involve their pupils in sharing the key messages of the letter sensitively and openly they are a valuable tool in engaging pupils in both the inspection and subsequent school improvement
4619125 last summer i went to a christian festival with the hope of getting ideas of something different i could do with my gap year there i heard a talk by patrick regan the founder of xlp an urban youth charity about working with kids in a disadvantaged area who are not in school within the peckham area of london i was blown away by it and decided i wanted to do that i had hoped to get into cambridge to do medicine and was going to reapply after doing my gap year i thought my gap year would give me a chance to go away and experience something that would contribute to my career as a doctor but a couple of months in i changed my mind it was after seeing the impact of what the charity did working with children on estates who felt alienated from school and society and helping them fulfil their potential seeing these kids changed my perspective on life and i decided that medicine maybe wasnt the right thing for me to do now ive decided to work with the salvation army and do a youth worker degree at spurgeons college in london and study and work around there im really pleased i did the gap year it has changed my life completely i was brought up in a quiet little town so to suddenly be in peckham where there is a knife crime problem and young people are being stabbed really opened my eyes if youve been stuck in the education system its a good idea to take a gap year and experience what life is like in the real world

4619127 after a year studying medical engineering at the university of bath i felt quite unfulfilled and decided to take a gap year to see what life was about i travelled in south america turkey italy and spain until i ran out of money and then worked in bars teaching english and driving quarrying machinery until i had enough money to continue my adventures what i really wanted to do was volunteer abroad but i couldnt afford the gap year industrys expensive all inclusive packages so in the end i travelled to bolivia with no contacts and by pure luck i linked up with a charity out there i didnt intend to found a business that year but i was frustrated that people like me were prevented from working with charities because of the cost and i had the idea of starting travellingbug i set up my company so that volunteers pay 350 for their own individual placement including a 100 donation to the charity in the first pilot trip with one charity and one group of students we took just under 3 000 and secured 6 000 through business competitions ive invested revenue back into the company and into our partner charity in bolivia so this year we have availability for 50 volunteers its going really well we now also work in uganda travellingbug is now my post uni employment plan my gap year was a great time to start being an entrepreneur because i had a lot of time on my hands im now back at university but travellingbug is still a full time job so last year i took on a fellow student as a business partner it can be hard to focus completely on studying i try to attend all my lectures but its not easy having said that my uni has been really supportive im a member of the universitys sife students in free enterprise team involved in educating people in ethical business sifes staff and other students help me to keep travellingbug growing in the right direction we work together sharing our time and ideas and the buzz must be catching because my flatmates are eager to start up their own business ideas i cant wait to get behind them my family are proud of my independence but they keep my feet on the ground they get the occasional shout from me to say mum that was the guardian on the phone but it doesnt seem to get me anything extra in my christmas stocking
4619128 when i was 17 i was out sailing with friends when i realised there was a need for a recovery device that could rescue an unconscious person overboard with the aid of just one person i was in sixth form at the time and when i was asked to design something for the community for my a level in product design my idea came back to me that day hypohoist a simple device to get people out of the water was born i had always planned to take a gap year but my intention was to do work experience at a hospital as i was aiming to study medicine but hypohoist changed my plans when i won the title of young engineer of britain in 2005 i decided to use my gap year to get my product into production i had to apply for a patent and get advice from a designer and engineer about how to make it commercially viable and then had to get it tested and approved next i had to find a partner company to manufacture and distribute the product before i finally had the big international launch at southampton boat show it was a busy year i also spent time promoting engineering to other young people i didnt plan the year just took it as it came and there were downsides because i was working constantly i missed two holidays so i could get my product launched but through the hypohoist i did get to travel to america representing britain as a young engineer and to denmark where i took part in an international competition when i started at uni studying design and engineering at brunel university after my gap year at first i found the age gap between myself and the others in my year a bit difficult my whole work ethic and schedule were completely different but i settled in and since then everything has happened fast i won the enterprising young brits award supported by the make your mark entrepreneurship campaign and that opened loads of doors for me to develop my product as well as my business and my personal skills sales are going very well and the money im making is helping towards my university fees and savings while at uni ive scaled down the time i spend on my product i put project work first because thats my real future i have to focus on new projects to diversify my skills and widen my knowledge but my gap year launching hypohoist has taken me on a truly life changing journey that i will remember for ever
4619129 some of the big agencies are using the environment as a kind of marketing tool and actually what theyre selling are essentially holidays
4619130 the rationale behind a lot of these projects is that youre getting people involved and engaged in the environment but if theyre only going out there for two weeks i dont see how that can be possible
4619131 some of them are certainly part of authentic scientific research expeditions but you need to establish very thoroughly before you go that this is the case what is the organisation you will be working with do they have plans to publish their research
4619132 what i was actually doing wasnt truly benefiting the local community we did build a playground and they were totally grateful it was a western ideal and it made me realise that i did it for my own selfish reasons
4619133 the system is not set in stone im open to reform long term there are a number of things were looking at the making good progress pilot is one of those but it would be wrong to rush into a change straight away
4619134 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009
4619135 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4619136 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4619137 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4619138 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4619139 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4619140 the olympic games are a gift to modern civilization a gift from the greeks

4619156 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4619157 when asked about the ads criticizing him and speaker pelosi for clinton supposedly not being on the ballot at the convention he scoffed clinton will be on the ballot at the convention and will be speaking there dean indicated that the rules were so clear on this matter that the groups running these ads and spreading these rumors must be associated with the other internet rumors going around such as obama being a muslim he also speculated that mccain supporters might be behind these rumors

4619184 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4619185 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4619186 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4619187 i think i can convince people on the other side of the table that we do not need tax
4619188 closest supporters friends since you are among our closest supporters i want to make you aware of some problems senator cornyn is experiencing with the houston
4619189 he is both the beginning of the religion and the meeting ground for all hindus
4619190 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4619191 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4619192 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4619193 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4619194 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4619195 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4619196 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4619197 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4619198 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4619199 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4619200 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4619201 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4619202 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4619203 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4619204 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4619205 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4619206 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4619207 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4619208 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4619209 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4619210 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4619211 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4619212 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4619213 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4619214 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4619215 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4619216 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4619217 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4619218 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4619219 this is a planning took where all things are going
4619220 the evidence does not support a finding that the students race national origin and or sex were the basis for the universitys actions
4619221 the office of civil rights finding doesnt mean anything spu is still a school like the kkk in my opinion
4619222 sound reason to believe that mr feyissa is a threat to persons on campus
4619223 mr feyissa was made aware of the schools lifestyle expectations and standards he was given warnings about his behaviors and provided with resources and opportunities to help him succeed as a member of the community
4619224 he did not learn from these experiences and failed to follow the guidelines set out for him
4619225 b ased on the findings of the investigation ocr cannot conclude that the university failed to comply with respect to the issue investigated
4619226 feyissa was unable to provide ocr specific examples or witnesses that could corroborate his allegation that non minority and female students were treated in a manner different from him with respect to the suspension from the university and being denied access to university property
4619227 the complaints were that the vp of campus life other campus leaders and campus security officers discriminated against him on the basis of race that they did not treat him as they did caucasian students
4619228 i dont feel at all that campus life is at fault in what they did
4619229 we attempted every step of the way to respond to any new information that was provided
4619230 the sadness to me in all of this is that weve not been able to help shakespear feyissa and wed like to think were the type of university that does but we couldnt
4619231 i really dont know i was confident i was going back to school
4619232 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4619233 s o incorretos porque se baseiam apenas em modelos matem ticos e apresentam resultados em cen rios que n o incluem por exemplo a atividade solar
4619234 curiosamente o astro nunca foi visto como um agente de esfriamento mas de aquecimento mas tem os dois pap is
4619235 portanto em dois anos aproximadamente haver uma pequena era de gelo que durar de 60 a 80 anos
4619236 as banks and credit unions begin to roll out mobile banking solutions for customers they have to manage a complex landscape of vendor offerings
4619237 with this report we developed a useful profiling tool which we call javelins target grids to help financial institutions better understand the various offerings available in order to determine best short and long term strategies
4619238 mobile banking vendor analysis a thorough comparison of features partnerships and overall strategy will yield highest profitability
4619239 hey admit it or not there are some guys who will kill again if theyre allowed to live you cant hold them in the prisons especially when you have liberal hippies running around unleashed struggling to come up with new excuses every year for releasing criminals from prison
4619240 waitaminnit how can you say killing is wrong and then prove it by killing someone
4619241 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4619242 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4619243 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4619244 see this is the kind of stuff daddy wrote when he was your age
4619245 what do you want with me jesus son of the most high god swear to god that you wont torture me
4619246 send us among the pigs allow us to go into them
4619247 mungkin orang tidak pernah membayangkan bagaimana peta ini dibuat sangat complicated penuh tantangan dan sulit tapi saya melakukannya sendiri
4619248 hasilnya tak terduga banyak toko buku kehabisan stok dan memesan kembali
4619249 waktu itu saya naik sepeda dan becak jakarta kan masih belum padat seperti sekarang
4619250 wilayah yang harus dicek sangat luas jadi sekarang saya menggunakan mobil
4619251 banyak teman saya menanyakan lokasi daerah di jakarta demikian pula pelanggan lufthansa itu mendorong saya untuk membuat peta jakarta yang lebih baik dan hasilnya berupa peta dki jakarta yang terbit tahun 1977 untuk menyambut hut ke 450 dki jakarta
4619252 saya tidak pernah membayangkan hanya dalam waktu 20 tahun peta yang saya buat menjadi peta lengkap waktu peta tahun 1990 terbit saya berpikir inilah peta jakarta yang terbaik saya tak pernah berpikir tahun tahun berikutnya saya akan mengerjakan peta lebih mutakhir
4619253 saya memang butuh istirahat agar bisa segar lagi jika bekerja di jakarta
4619254 rute bus di jakarta tidak seperti di london frankfurt atau tokyo sering berubah ubah selain itu jakarta sangat terkenal dengan jalan satu arah kecuali misalnya jalan ini satu arah kecuali truk bus atau kecuali hari libur atau kecuali pukul 06 00 10 00 dan sebagainya
4619255 ya saya menerima sejumlah kritik atas beberapa kesalahan yang ada memang tidak bisa sempurna seratus persen tapi saya selalu berusaha memperbaikinya
4619256 itu produk peta edisi sebelumnya yang dicetak ulang pada edisi baru kesalahan itu saya perbaiki pada halaman 84 halaman peta baru
4619257 tapi mungkin bagi orang lain itu cara mendapatkan peta dengan harga lebih murah
4619258 uang bukan tujuan utama bagi saya yang terpenting hasil karya saya bisa bermanfaat bagi masyarakat jabotabek bagi orang indonesia
4619259 mereka haruslah orang yang teliti dan akurat serta berpikir milimeter artinya mereka harus mau teliti mengukur ketepatan skala agar tidak salah
4619260 mexico is californias number one inbound market generating approximately 1 58 billion in spending so declines in that market would have a major impact on our economy including loss of jobs
4619261 in my role as national chair for the travel industry association im also concerned about what impeding travel would mean to the u s travel industry and economy just a five percent decline in overnight visitation from mexico would mean a loss of approximately 700 000 travelers and over 400 million in spending with a disproportionate impact on americas border states
4619262 the increase in business and leisure travel from mexico partially compensates for a decline of 2 million overseas visitors to the u s between 2000 and 2007
4619263 we must nurture and enhance this critical travel market through more efficient and secure travel systems and by combating a growing negative perception among mexican travelers that the u s has removed its welcome mat also our new requirements for u s citizens to provide passports in mexico have added a burden on mexican border states as well
4619264 inbound international travel is a leading american export providing a 17 4 billion trade surplus in 2007
4619265 just as the federal government is deeply involved in promoting trade with our neighbor to the south so too should it be involved in promoting travel to the united states
4619266 will only allow laptops to stay in bags through screening if they provide a clear and unobstructed x ray image of the laptop
4619267 reserves the right to re screen any bag or laptop regardless of the design of the bag
4619268 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4619269 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4619270 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4619271 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4619272 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4619273 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4619274 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4619275 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4619276 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4619277 important note note that it is important for both threads to synchronize on the same monitor in order to set up the happens before relationship properly
4619278 under the new memory model making the instance field volatile will
4619279 nothing in the old memory model treated final fields differently from any other field meaning synchronization was the only way to ensure that all threads see the value of a final field that was written by the constructor as a result it was possible for a thread to see the default value of the field and then at some later time see its constructed value this means for example that immutable objects like string can appear to change their value a disturbing prospect indeed
4619280 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4619281 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4619282 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4619283 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4619284 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4619285 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4619286 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4619287 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4619288 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4619289 finance guys in new york openly mock and ridicule lawyers as peons who make peanuts
4619290 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4619291 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4619292 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4619293 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4619294 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4619295 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4619296 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4619297 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4619298 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4619299 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4619300 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4619301 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4619302 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4619303 i knew i would marry my husband the minute i smelled him
4619304 ive always been into smell but this was different he really smelled good to me his scent made me feel safe and at the same time turned on and im talking about his real body smell not cologne or soap id never felt like that from a mans smell before weve been married for eight years now and have three kids and his smell is always very sexy to me
4619305 one of the most common things women tell marriage counselors is i cant stand his smell
4619306 this is not something that jumps out at you like smelling a good steak cooking on the grill
4619307 but the scent capability is there and its not surprising to find smell capacity in the context of sexual behavior
4619308 this might be a case where youre protecting yourself against a mate whos too similar or too dissimilar but theres a middle range where youre ok
4619309 people of different ethnicities can have similar profiles so race is not a good predictor of mhc dissimilarity
4619310 body odor is an external manifestation of the immune system and the smells we think are attractive come from the people who are most genetically compatible with us
4619311 as the proportion of mhc alleles increased womens sexual responsiveness to their partners decreased and their number of sex partners outside the relationship increased
4619312 when pregnant rodent females are exposed to strange males they can spontaneously abort
4619313 on a subconscious level her brain is realizing a mistake was made she married the wrong guy
4619314 some couples fertility problems may be related to the pill induced flip flop in mhc preferences
4619315 if youre looking for a man to be the father of your child
4619316 if shes in love he could smell like a garbage can and shed still be attracted to him
4619317 women are probably doing something unconsciously and men are responding to it unconsciously
4619318 we just dont know whether it has to do with a shift in their psychology their tone of voice or if its more physical as in the kind of pheromones theyre putting out
4619319 the pill might be producing cues that a woman is in the early stage of pregnancy which would not tend to elicit a lot of male sexual interest
4619320 it makes sense for men to be sensitive to that and for them not to feel the same chemistry with the woman
4619321 humans abuse body smell signals by hiding them masking them putting on deodorant
4619322 the noise to signal ratio was much better in primitive society
4619323 hunter gatherers didnt have to do a lot of kissing because they could smell each other pretty clearly from a few feet away
4619324 with all the showering scents and soap we have to get our noses and mouths really up close to people to get a good idea of their biochemistry people are more motivated to do a lot more kissing and petting to do that assessment before they have sex
4619325 youre going to get a real whiff at some point
4619326 scent can be a deal breaker if its not right just like someone being too stupid or unkind or short
4619327 people tend to treat this as an either or situation either were completely driven by pheromones like moths or were completely in charge of our own destiny
4619328 but its not a wild idea that both factors are involved
4619329 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4619330 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4619331 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4619332 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4619333 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4619334 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4619335 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4619336 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4619337 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4619338 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4619339 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4619340 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4619341 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4619342 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4619343 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4619344 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4619345 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4619346 one of the biggest anime wholesalers in china designing and producing various kinds of anime products with high qualitity competitive prices of our goods and superb service we have established long term business relations with a lot of clients in europe north america and australia
4619347 siempre he sido as pero antes no me escuchaba ni dios
4619348 were looking at the town center idea and asking how do we create the kind of communities at light rail stations that neighborhoods have identified in their plans
4619349 the omagh fatality list reads like a microcosm of troubles deaths and left no section of irish life untouched the town they attacked is roughly 60 40 catholic protestant and the dead consisted of protestants catholics a mormon and two spanish visitors they killed young old and middle aged fathers mothers sons daughters and grannies they killed republicans and unionists including a prominent local member of the ulster unionist party they killed people from the backbone of the gaelic athletic association they killed unborn twins bright students cheery shop assistants and many young people they killed three children from the irish republic who were up north on a day trip everyone they killed was a civilian the toll of death was thus both extraordinarily high and extraordinarily comprehensive
4619350 im only after getting a call from a man with a country accent saying theres a bomb in omagh main street near the courthouse a 500lb bomb its going to go off in 30 minutes
4619351 i have received a bomb call for omagh town centre approximately 200 yards from the courthouse and the code word malta pope was given
4619352 theres a bomb courthouse omagh main street 500 pounds explosion 30 minutes
4619353 am i through to omagh this is a bomb warning its going to go off in 30 minutes
4619354 part of the ongoing war against the brits we offer apologies to the civilians
4619355 nobody thought there was going to be a bomb in omagh everybody thought it was a hoax
4619356 three women in a shop ill go for a walk somewhere else
4619357 i was just back from my lunch about ten minutes and had walked straight past the car and everything and two minutes before i was hanging out the window cause a girl that i worked with was walking past the bottom she was going out home and you know we were kind of chatting to her out the window i mean if it had went off then id have been killed id say because or a lot worse
4619358 i was in the kitchen and heard a big bang everything fell on me the cupboards blew off the wall the next thing i got blasted out into the street there was smashed glass everywhere bodies children people were inside out
4619359 i met my friend and we decided to go on down to the bus depot and as we were walking down there just past mcelroys shoe shop we were right in the middle of the road then the bomb went off i was thrown to the ground so i was and obviously i couldnt run or nothing and i saw my leg and all well i just thought ill never be able to walk again you know and then you just have to wait for somebody to come so i sat there and there was a lot of screaming around but i didnt i must have been in shock cause i didnt scream or nothing i just sat and waited
4619360 first of all there was like this massive bang which ill and then you just heard you know glass and roofs falling and you know just and then there was silence for a while and then it was like just screaming and shouting and complete mayhem it was quite scary
4619361 there was smoke coming from the brow of the hill and we stopped in our tracks for what seemed like an eternity and then we just ran towards it
4619362 i ran into the front of kells what was left of it and i went in through where the window would have been and i found the wife lying face down in the rubble now the clothes was blew off her and the first thing i reached for was her arm and i tried for her pulse there was no life i knew she was dead and then i couldnt get there was no sign of shauna or tracey and i knew they were in the shop with her and i started lifting lumps of timber and everything was carnage but there was still no sign of shauna and i thought she was dead i thought she was under the rubble thought she was buried under her mother i found tracey my second daughter on her knees beside her mammy trying her pulse like a woman who went to omagh twice a year to do shopping about the only two days she went was to get the uniforms and christmas
4619363 there were limbs lying about that had been blown off people everyone was running round trying to help people there was a girl in a wheelchair screaming for help who was in a bad way there were people with cuts on their heads bleeding one young boy had half of his leg completely blown off he didnt cry or anything he was just in a complete state of shock
4619364 it was horrible so much blood and flesh and glass sticking out of people
4619365 the first thing i noticed was what i suppose was a shop dummy lying in the middle of the street so i knew then there was people injured cause i could see everybody coming running with blood and one thing or another after i passed the first shop dummy that i saw lying in the street out of one of the clothes shops the next thing i saw in the street again was what i thought was another shop dummy but unfortunately that wasnt that was either a man or a woman ive no idea what it was but it was just a body and there were neither legs or arms or anything to be seen on it it was a sight that ill not forget anyway thats for sure and that was only one there was a lot of other sights lying on that street that really yet is still hard to describe how anybody could do that to innocent people i have no idea
4619366 there were bodies strewn all over the street it was like a battlefield of burning flesh and dead bodies with a burst water main spraying everywhere i helped lift six bodies out and did all i could for some of the injured people men women and children were lying on the road dazed and bleeding people were groaning children were crying and there was an overwhelming smell of burning flesh
4619367 there was an awful lot of water because there was burst water mains there were people lying dead and the water was just gushing over the top of them the other striking thing was there was so much blood there was blood literally everywhere an awful lot of blood on the footpath and on the road a lot of the policemen were splattered from head to toe in blood and i really mean that they were putting people who were either dead badly maimed or injured into sheets or anything they could find and just sort of dragging them down to the bottom end of the town they were waiting for any available ambulance or car to put the people into
4619368 to see that body lying in the street with smoke sort of rising from it and the smell on the street
4619369 there were limbs hanging off bodies being carried on doors everything was chaotic then just as the bus was ready to leave the door opened and someone handed a severed arm in i think that was just too much for the driver i think he cried all the way to the hospital
4619370 it was like a scene from hell i wasnt able to drive fast because people were screaming in pain as we went over the ramps at the hospital i could hear the roars of pain
4619371 nothing could have prepared me for what i saw people were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there was blood all over the place people were crying for help and looking for something to kill the pain other people were crying out looking for relatives you could not really be trained for what you had seen unless you were trained in vietnam or somewhere like that
4619372 when i came to the front of the hospital it was absolutely quiet
4619373 we ran from here to the hospital and we went in and it was just room after room after room of children some were in wheelchairs bandaged others were lying on stretchers others were just simply huddled in the corner no parents god only knows what happened to them we worked our way through the crowd and at the bottom were our two children with their friend and my mother daughter was remarkably calm and lacerations the lacerations were confined really to her hairline from what we gathered she was obviously very distressed she bled quite profusely
4619374 he was crouched down against the wall with his head in his hands he told me that his wife was dead and his children were missing i covered him up with a sheet and put my arms around him but there was nothing else i could do there was also a young boy of about 11 or 12 strapped into a stretcher his hair was burnt and standing on end and he was deathly white he kept staring at me with huge frightened eyes that image will haunt me for ever
4619375 i stayed in ward five with a local lady doing what i could until she was air lifted to altnagelvin hospital in derry for further treatment
4619376 what chance have any of us got when we are told the bomb is at a courthouse when the actual target is the ordinary townspeople in a busy shopping area hundreds of yards away there can be no ifs or buts about this there are no so called legitimate targets there can be no excuse whatever for putting the lives of hundreds of people at risk such people serve no cause but that of murder and mayhem with the help of the decent people of northern ireland we will do everything in our power to ensure those responsible for this outrage are brought to justice
4619377 to be bold lads who ripped the heart out of omagh
4619378 at the end of the first week i actually was allowed access to one part of the building by the police it was under very special circumstances because the forensic had not finished their work it was quite late at night and it was into the nicholl amp shiels corner basically it was to assess the restaurant area above there were some very obvious structural cracks and that again is a memory that will always be with me as we walked through the building the rain was coming through the roof we scanned the torch it was a very very eerie feeling maybe 20 to 30 tables with lunches cups of coffee exactly the way they had been when the bomb went off and that particular building was packed at that stage and then you felt a stickiness on your feet and as i turned the torch down i realised i was walking on blood the whole way along the building so you can only imagine what it must have been like at the time for the people in there
4619379 all we want is that my youngsters and everybody elses youngsters it doesnt matter whether theyre catholic protestant hindu or whatever religion they are that they can go to school come home and their fathers and mothers are there and theyre not afraid that every time they walk down the street if someone drops a bin lid that its a bomb
4619380 i am totally horrifed by this action i condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever
4619381 it is a ghastly act a cruel act we will ruthlessly suppress those reponsible for the attack this is the most evil deed in years from our point of view we will continue to work in dealing with this particular group with the ruc and the gardai
4619382 this is an appalling act of savagery there is total determination to bring the perpetrators to justice but an equal determinatiion that they will not be allowed to destroy the process
4619383 the people who perpetrated the omagh bombing are addicted to violence and have no place in a civilised society
4619384 on behalf of every american i condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly i extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy i renew my pledge to stand with the people of northern ireland against the perpetrators of violence they will find no friends here
4619385 there must be decisive action to stop the terrorists who are committed to bringing death and destruction
4619386 the sort of people who would plant this device arent interested in anything other than murder i can only come to the conclusion that bloody murder was their intent
4619387 to bring such sadness and suffering to the people of omagh at this stage is a crime against humanity
4619388 it is clear that the people who carried out this terrible deed today are not only appalling murderers they are undiluted fascists
4619389 it was an indefensible action those responsible are aligning themselves with the forces opposed to a democratic settlement of the conflict here
4619390 i was shocked to hear of the appalling crime in omagh which resulted in so many deaths and injuries please pass on my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved injured and those others who have suffered in their distress
4619391 it is the nio who spawned the process of buying off the terrorists and encouraging the gun
4619392 this atrocity would not have happened if the ira had handed over its weapons and explosives sinn fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody atrocity
4619393 this is the most horrific event in the history of northern ireland
4619394 i remember only too well feeling deeply angered when my great uncle lord mountbatten and other relations were blown to pieces nineteen years ago i remember so well feeling that so i can understand a little some of the feelings perhaps of those who lost their loved ones on this occasion
4619395 it is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable murder can never be excused or justified the people of northern ireland will treat the statement and its authors with the contempt they deserve
4619396 it is a pathetic attempt at an excuse for mass murder it is contemptable and it is an insult to the people of omagh
4619397 itu hanya hanya akal akalan untuk menghindari kekisruhan dan perpecahan intern partai mereka tidak bisa mengendalikan kader kadernya yang mulai resah

4619418 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4619419 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4619430 access must be immediate and unimpeded for those humanitarian efforts
4619431 we have started work with the georgian government and have engaged the g 7 the imf and other international financial institutions to rapidly develop an economic support package for the georgian economy to build on its demonstrated track record and to resume its rapid growth
4619432 there were many mercenaries from ukraine and the baltic states we have found dead bodies of african americans too
4619433 the official supposed that it was exactly the reason why the georgian side had not provided any reports about the losses which it was suffering during the military operation
4619434 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests

4619471 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4619472 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4619473 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement

4619484 grrr me no like this game because my sister like it too
4619485 if the wii keeps selling like it is now it will lead to some very sad times in the gaming future where
4619486 if the wii keeps selling like it is now it will lead to some very sad times in the gaming future
4619487 the first that id want to clarify is that the concept that wii intentionally does not cater to core gamers is probably a misconception and perhaps one thats almost a pr tactic used by some of the other companies to paint us as a company thats not targeting core gamers but in fact while we may not be focusing on the high end graphics and technology that core gamers would typically be drawn to the types of games we create and continue to create are certainly games that people who play games would certainly want to continue playing i think that theres probably one other element to it and thats that our view of how we use e3 has changed for a very long time e3 was an event where and certainly nintendo included catered specifically to the core gamer now we look at more an opportunity for us to introduce new concepts and new types of play that we intend to bring to the broader audience particularly because of the media that gathers at e3 now so while attending an e3 event like this they might be given the impression that nintendo is no longer focusing on the games that appeal to the core gamer in fact were still working on many of those titles but its just not the type of event where well be showcasing that anymore
4619488 i love the other systems but i need a nintendo because my favorite games are mario zelda metroid etc and so if i want to play those i need it
4619489 gtaiv ffxiii re5 where do i sign up ok maybe not quite the same but you get the idea one great game already out 2 games that are getting great previews
4619490 i just dont feel that nintendo and third party developers have tapped into the systems potential
4619491 use the wiimote to perform repetitive tasks such as tightening bolts cutting off chicken wings or stamping license plates combined with the wii fit balance board you can simulate your chances of falling into the gears of the conveyor belt or mayonnaise separator as you try to stay awake and get through your 14 hour shift

4619501 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4619502 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4619503 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4619504 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4619505 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4619506 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4619507 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4619508 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4619509 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4619510 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4619511 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4619512 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4619513 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4619514 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4619515 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4619527 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4619528 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4619529 we know that asthma prevalence is higher among boys than girls but that the condition later in life is more prevalent in women than men
4619530 this study is particularly exciting as it provides an insight into the mechanisms involved in asthma development during the transition period between childhood and adulthood demonstrating how we can influence these processes and develop new targeted therapies
4619531 we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers when we get the good stuff and it gets on to the specials board its brilliant

4619544 is to drive consumers away from the pub and into their armchair to drink cheap alcohol
4619545 she was saying that where she is from its not unusual for the hairdressers to work from their local pub we thought about it and decided that adding hairdressing to our menu late every thursday afternoon was a great way to bring in trade at a notoriously quite time of the day its a drop in service so people turn up and hope that she is free it is only 9 per cut which is a bargain for london so if arlenes busy most customers are happy to wait around until she is finished that means they sit at the bar and have a drink or two which means a little extra money for us any way of making yourself stand out at a time like this can only be a good thing especially when it means gathering trade at an otherwise quiet time there are so many pubs around here and most of them are leaning towards the gastro trend in order to pull in trade but this has always been a traditional pub which is something the landlord nick is very proud of he has brought in modern aspects to the d cor and to the menu but he is keen that the pub remains at the heart of the community instead of seeing the pub as simply somewhere to go and have a drink we see it as more than that as a place where activities take place having a back room is a great amenity on top of the scrabble tournaments and quiz nights that weve added to our regular routine were thinking of hiring out an area to local theatre groups of course this is primarily a business and we need to get around the current climate which isnt the best for trade so we have been considering new ways to gather custom
4619546 my partner mark few and i bought this place four years ago with the sole intention of creating a traditional village pub with a focus on community values
4619547 its important that we spend a lot of time behind the bar engaging with the customers rather than employing part timers who come and go and arent part of the scenery the idea of the pub historically is that it is a large living room only one that happens to sell drinks and refreshments above all it should be a place to socialise and make friends a while back one of our regulars mentioned that shed joined a knitting club over in ealing and found it hard to get to each week it occurred to me that having our own knitting group would make for a nice sunday afternoon activity so i asked around the locals and they were up for it four of us met up the following week for a knit a drink and a chat and since then its blossomed now weve added a cycling club and a book club the boost in trade is great but also people make connections with people they might otherwise never meet its great for local trade too as we act as a conduit for information if someone is new to the area and needs a tradesman we can say ok well over there is x who is an electrician or in three hours y will be in and hes a mechanic in that sense weve built a brand it is a way to feed back into the community by creating sustainable business in the area
4619548 holding the sunday service in our pub was actually the reverends idea but it was just what we needed
4619549 the general climate has been on the down in st austell since the town went under redevelopment a while back were only a small market town and before visitors would come here to do their food shopping at the supermarket then theyd pop into the various smaller shops once theyd done that they might come in here to have a pint or two which meant guaranteed business now they have pulled down the tesco the smaller shops have been driven out of the area and that has hit us hard there were only four pubs here for years but a big chain moved in and that really messed with our custom and the smoking ban didnt help either it has been a really tough time then the reverend suggested that we hold the sunday service at the seven stars because he wanted to bring the christian message to people who would not necessarily make the decision to attend a service for us it was an opportunity to make a bit more on sundays which we have weve held two services here so far there has been great interest and the congregation was considerable i am open to any new ideas and would happily hold a number of events from the pub the whole industry is struggling and i am willing to try anything i can in order to help my business survive
4619550 the summers probably the toughest time for pubs especially those without gardens
4619551 despite this the old blue never really has a problem drawing crowds there are loads of really nice pubs in this area but there is a certain crowd who will always come to this one we are owned by the vice brand which has really good contacts within the music industry so we manage to book bands that other pubs would be unlikely to get hold of the arctic monkeys and the rascals are just two of the bigger bands who have played secret gigs here people know that if they come here theyre likely to catch big bands that are used to packing out stadiums and huge venues and rarely do such intimate gigs as playing in the upstairs room of an old pub theres never a shortage of performers or an audience this is a really old venue built in 1866 and what weve done is to keep that aspect intact while making it stand out as a music venue as much as a drinking place other pubs have music nights but we go further than that every night we have either a band or a dj working from the 120 capacity venue upstairs we try to keep entry free or at least at a minimal cost where possible we hold a lot of launch parties and events here and we always try to make them as different as possible recently we bought in a load of cut out platforms with scenes drawn on them and holes for your head like you get on the beach we just want our nights to be a bit different even if someone doesnt fancy a big performance and just wants a quiet drink and some good music in the main bar theres a free juke box that has been provided and stocked by record label rough trade so people who are into certain types of music know that here theyll get to listen to stuff that they wouldnt get in other pub juke boxes we have a huge diversity of genres stocked here not just whats hip at the time by carving a reputation in one area ie as a venue and music based pub we can tap into a particular scene we draw in customers who might otherwise end up going elsewhere and make sure they come back again
4619552 our philosophy is if the pub industry in general isnt doing well
4619553 let us see what can be done to make that work in our favour rather than dwelling on a slump in the market were finding ways to make our pub stand out its never enough just to serve drinks its important that we dont sacrifice the quality of our food and ale and were wary of succumbing to the gastro trend when my business partner martha herbst and i found this place under a year ago we found a real pub and that is what we wanted to play on in order to attract new custom wed rather complement what we already have a beautiful old venue than mess with the basics and weve found lots of exciting ways to bring in trade mondays are comedy nights where we showcase five or six acts a pop from all over the country on tuesdays we have fully qualified magicians while a tarot reader works away on the pub floor other nights we have djs and live musicians there is no door charge though donations are of course welcome together martha and i have a background in graphic design club promotion and web development so we use things like well designed posters a proper website and even a facebook group to get our name out there are more everyday ways to reach target customers even small things like offering a sunday roast from midday through to closing time means we get customers that others miss out on

4619575 item six on the agenda the meaning of life now harry youve had some thoughts on this
4619576 thats right yeah ive had a team working on this over the past few weeks and what weve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts one people are not wearing enough hats two matter is energy in the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a persons soul however this soul does not exist ab initio it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self observation however this is rarely achieved owing to mans unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia

4619634 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good

4619787 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4619788 i was in high school when she hit it big
4619789 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4619790 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4619791 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4619792 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4619793 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4619794 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4619795 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4619796 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4619797 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4619798 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4619799 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4619803 gostaria de entender porque ele falou disso com a imprensa se tem o filho dele ao lado todo momento pelo que entendi ele quer o que todo pai quer que o vald via jogue na europa na inglaterra it lia alemanha espanha mas tenho certeza que o vald via j falou com o pai dele antes de decidir qualquer coisa chama a diretoria e fala que n o quer o filho dele vendido
4619804 a nica proposta que veio foi do hertha berlin e ficou aqu m do que o palmeiras queria seria timo para ele jogar na europa desde que surgisse proposta de l e n o veio nenhuma outra a que surgiu foi dos emirados rabes e uma grande proposta pessoal o jogador conversou comigo e com o clube e todos viram que foi muito boa
4619805 n o podemos esquecer que algumas vendas no brasil foram feitas para o leste europeu que tamb m n o tem a mesma m dia que a europa houve algumas vendas at do palmeiras para o jap o daquele time fant stico quando passei aqui pela primeira vez nem por isso deixaram a m dia quando o jogador sabe joga em qualqer canto
