5400016 falun gong practitioners have been persecuted in china it is a fact nobody can deny it then when they are subjected to the unreasonable persecution they are brave enough to resist the chinese communist regime and step forward to speak for themselves it is very precious and rare in china if only for this point i admire them
5400017 one were those with ulterior motives the others are idiots
5400018 we certainly do not want china to be in chaos but we do not want to see that chinese people are persecuted you falun gong practitioners must keep up with your efforts so china will have hope

5400021 during a busy qualifying session if you want to accurately deliver a small amount of fuel to the car it is easier to use a small churn of fuel rather than connecting the regular race refuelling rig article 29 2 of the 2008 sporting regulations states that a driver may remain in his car throughout refuelling but unless an fia approved race refuelling system is used the engine must be stopped we refuelled heikkis car during the q2 session using a churn while his engine was still running but we reasoned incorrectly as it happened that we were operating within the regulations because we were using an approved intertechnique the fia approved supplier of refuelling equipment to all f1 teams nozzle to deliver the fuel having discussed the matter with the stewards we accepted that we were in breach of the sporting regulations clearly though we received no performance advantage from doing this and accepted the stewards judgment as totally fair
5400022 generally speaking when you are leading a grand prix and showing good pace you are more risk averse than those behind you the first stint of the race clearly showed we had an inherent performance advantage over the rest of the field so much so in fact that we felt comfortable about bringing lewis in early for his first pitstop and fuelling him long for his second stint when the safety car was deployed we evaluated the options and felt that keeping lewis out and running low fuel on a clear track outweighed the potential difficulties of pitting him which could have dropped him down the pack and would also have penalised heikki who would have been forced to queue in the pitlane behind lewis we were also affected by a number of contributing factors that we couldnt have foreseen when we made the call firstly the safety car stayed out for longer than we had anticipated which meant the number of laps available for lewis to pull out an advantage was reduced secondly more cars pitted than we expected this meant there was less traffic between lewis and felipe after the safety car came in finally we felt lewis would have an advantage running on low fuel with used tyres in fact the track evolution shifted to give greater benefit to cars fuelled heavily that made his job harder
5400023 if youre a leading team and you get it wrong then youre going to face criticism but hindsight is always 20 20 and we feel we made the right decisions based on the tough choices available to us dont forget too that it was less clear cut for lewis because we had fuelled him longer than the other cars at his first pitstop we had a bigger fuel window than the other teams who were much closer to their second pitstop when the safety car was deployed therefore it was a much easier call for them than it was for us and im sure the decision for ferrari was far more straightforward they probably werent going to beat us and if the tables had been turned wed doubtless have faced criticism if massa had stayed out jumped us and then capitalised on his advantage with a late splash and dash to the finish but lets not forget that nick heidfeld made the strategy work staying out under the safety car and finishing fourth so the strategy remained a valid one
5400024 given his stature within the team and the commitment he shows to his role we thought the new title of sporting director best reflected the progressive evolution of daveys responsibilities within mclaren dave has been hugely committed to this team he joined mclaren in 1974 and has played a central role in developing the race team into what it is today we all appreciate daveys contribution hes loyal forthright and fearlessly hard working in fact hes pivotal to the way we go racing each weekend and thoroughly deserves to take on this broader role but while his duties expand he still remains our conduit to the wider world of f1 and will continue to attend the regular team managers meetings

5400038 what had begun as a simple act of civil disobedience ended up galvanizing the modern movement for civil rights
5400039 on this day we remember the great inspiration this movement drew from the quiet courage shown by an alabama woman riding home on a cleveland avenue bus
5400040 most everyone in the civil rights division realized that with the change of administration there would be some cutting back of some cases
5400041 but i dont think people anticipated that it would go this far that enforcement would be cut back to the point that people felt like they were spinning their wheels
5400042 bias in the real world is translating to the virtual world
5400043 were not claiming that we have found any new bias

5400059 immaturedness is that a word and pray to god to become more like you
5400060 we sympathised with falun gong in the past but due to their recent behaviour we no longer support them
5400061 pretending to be a sympathizer is very effective so high level leaders request that we all use this method to spread rumors about falun gong among chinese student associations online chat rooms various overseas chinese associations and in mainland chinese society
5400062 actually its very easy to identify these impostors because this group of people dont understand falun gong at all they all speak according to the spy training they received so the words they use are basically the same
5400063 falun gong will bring death to china and are not patriotic

5400066 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendency and that we were going to go on from that
5400067 unfortunately we invited pressure on ourselves made poor decisions in key areas and were not able to recover all the hard work evaporated in those eight minutes and the game went away from us
5400068 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research

5400072 i was told that it was right and proper for me as a boy to pay attention to my teachers so that i should do well at my study of grammar and get on in the world
5400073 but we enjoyed playing games and were punished for them by men who played games themselves however grown up games are known as business and even though boys games are much the same they are punished for them by their elders no one pities either the boys or the men though surely we deserved pity for i cannot believe that a good judge would approve of the beatings i received as a boy on the ground that my games delayed my progress in studying subjects which would enable me to play a less creditable game later in life was the master who beat me himself very different from me if he were worsted by a colleague in some petty argument he would be convulsed with anger and envy much more so than i was when a playmate beat me at a game of ball

5400081 when a kid who hasnt done any community service for 17 years suddenly becomes beyond gandhi like you know somethings going on
5400082 a kid in eighth grade goes off on an exotic experience that eventually becomes the subject of an essay we see a lot of that
5400083 i really didnt think about putting my summers on my college applications

5400085 when i asked why the enrollment manager told me our models predicted he wouldnt come boys who like science dont go to our school he ended up at skidmore
5400086 the colleges goal is to boost application numbers so they can lower their admit rate
5400087 you could take the entire admitted class wipe it out and admit the next group of candidates and you wouldnt see much difference
5400088 at the ivies you may be taught by a teaching assistant while at a small college you can become friends with the professor

5400121 we may have reached a different conclusion i continue to believe that there is great value in the oregon plan it boosts salmon recovery through funding protective regulations and most of all through the voluntary restoration efforts being undertaken by thousands of oregons landowners i think the plan is making an important difference

5400225 what is the stupidest mistake you have ever made with money
5400226 so far we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in
5400227 when officers went there they said it was like stepping into a place frozen in time
5400228 the cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades nothing had been disturbed for decades even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there
5400229 i am surprised there is a delay i cannot see it is necessary to take so long as there has been a lot of preparation for this legislation
5400230 hopefully we wont run into any of the technical difficulties we ran into last week
5400231 as far as we can tell its elements of the old taleban leadership who are at the forefront of what is happening now but they are overseeing a very diffuse group
5400232 many of them would describe themselves as adherents to the taleban outlook but it includes people who are essentially allied to local warlords
5400233 it certainly includes small landowners who are concerned about losing their capacity to grow opium poppies because of the eradication campaigns that are on

5400236 it just wasnt the best use of all that money
5400237 there was so much pressure to spend the money right away and charities heeded it now programs that might have lasted five or seven years to cope with long term needs that are just emerging have been shut down
5400238 i gave money for that exact purpose to create a permanent safety net
5400239 but that hasnt happened and now they have spent all the money

5400245 these moves would address the governments concerns about the negative effect of party political films and its desire
5400246 yes but were not having a wake up call were having a witch hunt for who got us here
5400247 a run on the banks so fast your eyes would spin this is when everyone tops up their tank we havent run out of oil but we could literally run out of usable diesel and gasoline and then we would have the great american disaster because within a week wed have run out of food

5400256 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
5400257 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues

5400265 he called in all shook up after the first plane passed
5400266 he was telling me the wing of a plane had just missed their crane
5400267 listen this is going to hit otto said he started telling people to get out
5400268 there was no engine trouble he didnt try to maneuver this plane was on a mission
5400269 102 minutes the untold story of the fight to survive inside the twin towers
5400270 i saw the plane come in my office faces north i just finished my coffee and i heard my friend say oh no oh no this plane was coming right at us then it went up and hit the upper floors
5400271 i saw the plane out of the corner of my eye youre accustomed to a plane taking up a certain amount of space in the sky this plane was huge i just froze and watched the plane
5400272 it was coming down the hudson it was banking toward me i saw the tops of both wings
5400273 it was turning to make sure it hit the intended target it plowed in about 20 stories down dead center into the north face of the building
5400274 i saw the second plane fly right past my window
5400275 i have to go now they told us to evacuate the building there is complete chaos here
5400276 it disintegrated on impact my heart was pounding ive never been so scared in my life
5400277 i thought it was too low i thought it wasnt going to clear the tower
5400278 i turned and said to my friend man that plane is flying low
5400279 before i could even get the last word out it hit the side of the building and just blew the other side out
5400280 oh my god this plane is going to hit my building
5400281 i just happened to raise my head watching the statue of liberty and as i watched i saw this giant aircraft coming in slow motion towards me eye level eye contact and i just froze
5400282 im trembling and im crying lord dont leave me here to die and i realize that im covered with debris when i try to get up
5400283 peeking through the rubble all i could see was the plane wing wedged at my office door 20 feet from where i was
5400284 while assisting a female burn victim i observed po rivero look up towards the wtc tower 2 at this time the undersigned heard the sound of jet engines and observed an aircraft with a blue color tail fly directly into the south face of wtc tower 2 following the impact an enormous explosion occurred causing debris to begin to fall down all around the wtc complex
5400285 we understood that a cessna had accidentally collided into a tower of the wtc
5400286 shortly after our arrival on scene we saw a large commercial jetliner approaching from staten island at a very low altitude
5400287 but it took only fractions of a moment to realize what we were about to see the plane veered to our right crossed governors island turned left crossing over our boat and turned into a vertical position as it flew into the tower
5400288 there was a mood of disbelief and anger every person in the room knew that this was not an accident and that it was time to go into emergency mode
5400289 we were standing with the chief and we heard somebody yell theres another plane
5400290 then it came into the range of my hearing and it sounded louder and louder and louder and there it was it went right into the building into the south tower now we have a real problem on our hands we have two buildings hit by planes thousands and thousands of people trapped
5400291 i looked over my shoulder and saw the united airlines plane coming it came over the statute of liberty it was just like a movie it just directly was guided into the second tower
5400292 that plane is closer to us its really not a big plane going towards the building
5400293 i just came out of the fulton street subway when i heard this terrifying explosion i looked up and saw smoke surrounding the world trade center people started running there was mass hysteria
5400294 saw a huge piece of the plane shoot out from the second tower heading in a decline curve
5400295 war terrorism amp geopolitical crisis is religion the solution or the problem
5400296 does religion even if its entirely man invented does it at least make people behave better does it make people treat each other more kindly
5400297 i dont think there is any evidence at all at all to make us believe that true or false religion makes us better in times of crisis terrorism and so forth
5400298 it is true that islamic radicals do what they do in the name of god
5400299 there is an effort here to equate islamic radicalism with christianity the crimes of islam cannot be reasonably imputed to any other religion not hinduism not buddhism or christianity but this false equation has enabled the new atheists to get quite a bit of mileage
5400300 i think today more than ever in history we have strong scientific evidence that points in the direction of a creator of the universe in the areas of cosmology physics astronomy biochemistry genetics and human consciousness
5400301 the case for the real jesus a journalist investigates current attacks on the identity of christ
5400302 the speed of light the expansion rate of the universe the strength of gravitational attraction and the strength of many other fundamental forces are balanced within very fine tolerances to allow for the possibility of life in the universe
5400303 the evidence has led many physicists to suspect that the universe itself is intelligently designed
5400304 the fact that evolutionary biologists cant explain all aspects of the natural world doesnt mean they are inexplicable or that forces we dont understand now cant explain it
5400305 even if it turns out that darwinian evolution or neo darwinism is wrong even if a is wrong it doesnt make b right its irrelevant whether you knock down every little aspect of evolutionary theory you still have this other problem of scientifically proving intelligent design
5400306 there is a second category of evidence for intelligent design that comes from microbiology and biochemistry where scientists have discovered an exquisite realm of nanotechnology little miniature circuits and machines sliding clamps turbines rotary engines and roboticlike walking proteins which tow around vesicles of important materials on tracks and rails throughout the cell
5400307 at the beginning of the 21st century weve discovered that the cell long believed to be just a lump of protoplasm is really hundreds of super computers and that the human body contains some 300 billion miles of dna coding
5400308 and just as the discovery that the atom wasnt a massy lump brought down newtonian physics so the discovery that human beings are chiefly information and that the cell is a multiple parallel super computer that is also a nanotechnology builder and constructor will bring down the darwinian model
5400309 and these christians then launch the largest conversion wave ever known to history
5400310 they go from about 50 at the time of christs death to really a majority of the roman empire by the fourth century
5400311 the more anglicans and catholics are able to study issues together and to discern an appropriate gospel response the stronger will be the impact of their mission endeavours
5400312 when we live myopically in the fleeting present oblivious to our past heritage and apostolic traditions we could well be suffering from spiritual alzheimers and when we behave in a disorderly manner going whimsically our own way without any co ordination with the head or the other members of our community it could be ecclesiastical parkinsons disease
5400313 i guess what he was saying was that were perhaps inclined to ignore the legacy of the past and how it can be positively deployed in the present i think that what he said at the conference was in many ways very important and to have somebody from outside the anglican communion giving affirming a challenging presentation is a very important part of our work this week
5400314 seeing the challenges faced by people with parkinsons disease or dementia trivialised by comments from such a prominent public figure is demoralising
5400315 people with dementia and parkinsons face the challenge of coping with a physical condition which slowly robs them of their lives these comments serve to reinforce negative stereotypes surrounding these devastating conditions

5400317 mostly because of higher pricing and seemingly less demand in certain geographies economies we believe that sms forwarding is a very developing economies phenomenon where other means of entertainment are few
5400318 it is disturbing to me that individuals would keep such dangerous wildlife in their homes and in neighborhoods where they put their families visitors and neighbors at such high risk
5400319 theres a clause if i cancel but no mention of one if she cancels i want that added of course but i want some help on what else i need to have added what else should be in the contract

5400328 a review has just been completed of the accessibility of scottish political party web sites and found that many disabled voters are likely to have significant difficulty accessing on line policy and manifesto information limiting their ability to use the web to help them make an informed choice when they vote
5400329 i am an honours student in scotland and for my honours project i am doing a prototype web site for audio described background material it is a small example of how a film can have some background information into sets costumes character appearance outwith the description that the film would have in a cinema for example the costumes in a film like braveheart are quite intricate different tartans etc and there is not really enough time to describe them during the running of the film without detracting from the characters dialogue so what i propose is a web site or cd containing that information before going to see the film i used realone and smil for the audio described trailer
5400330 also i would like to think that the possibilities for such a web site apply to other facets of the media tv theatre etc so it is really an initial study into whether such a format would be well received
5400331 what a beautiful web site yes the original articles are very very accessible the text size option in ie works great but the default font size is perfect so i didnt need to change anything and nothing is truncated along the right margin gosh ive got a lot of great reading ahead of me
5400332 more than 78 of british government sites need an accessibility overhaul those are rather ugly numbers and as the article indicates the costs may take a substantial chunk out of their budgets i hope they can afford the redesigns and testing i wish they would release more details about what they analyzed and how they conducted the reviews
5400333 to assist in decreasing the digital divide by facilitating access to the internet and to learning opportunities for those who currently do not or cannot use the internet because of a lack of skills or confidence or because of physical or cognitive disabilities
5400334 one thousand websites will be investigated for their ability to be accessed by britains 8 5 million disabled people in the disability rights commissions drc first formal investigation it was announced today a key aim of the investigation will be to identify recurrent barriers to web access and to help site owners and developers recognise and avoid them
5400335 the opening issue contains an interview with julie howell of rnib by anitra pavka and also a rehash of my accessible tables article there isalso a news section and resources section

5400337 often people have an image in their minds of what kind of person a given school wants
5400338 usually its because they know someone who went there so they try to be like that person
5400339 business school admissions committees aim to enroll a broad mix of different personalities and backgrounds so they want to know who you really are even going beyond your professional life to include any significant experiences you may have had like a serious illness or an eye opening trip abroad tell your real story trying to be someone you arent is likely to backfire
5400340 there is no particular advantage in being in the first round of applications
5400341 its much more important to submit a really great application you do want to meet the deadline of course but quality counts more than speed
5400342 lets say youve been laid off three times like one client i had dont just ignore that on your application talk about how you bounced back and what you learned from those experiences
5400343 likewise if you have a glaringly low grade or two on your undergraduate record address the question of why that happened often people think well they know im smart and that was a long time ago so its no big deal but you need to explain it because it will be noticed
5400344 a really common mistake is to get fixated on the essay portion of the application and overlook the crucial role of recommendations
5400345 keep in touch with them so you are sure the letters get submitted on time
5400346 prestige is less important than how well they know you
5400347 sometimes people will ask the ceo for a recommendation because that ceo attended the school the person is applying to but admissions committees want specific examples of how you work especially in the areas of teamwork leadership ethics and respect for others the ceo is unlikely to know those details
5400348 its a good idea to ask one or two people whose judgment you trust to look over your application before you submit it to see if they spot any flaws or omissions
5400349 if you follow too many suggestions your essay will end up reading as if it were written by a committee and you definitely dont want that
5400350 often people assume that being put on the wait list is the same as not being accepted and they give up but lots of waitlisted applicants do get admitted theres an art to it
5400351 if your gmat score was relatively low take the test again send another recommendation or two if you can if the school wants you to come in for an interview do that and keep in touch with the admissions committee you dont want to hound them but its perfectly okay to send a letter if you get promoted or if youre working on a stretch assignment that broadens your skills
5400352 every mba program is different and you want to focus on the ones that are right for you
5400353 compare the schools carefully and visit as many of the campuses as you can if you can sit in on a class or two so much the better that way when youre asked why you want to go to this particular school youll have a convincing answer instead of just sounding like youre reading from a brochure

5400370 the real reason for the decision to suppress ntdtv exposes how eutelsat operates in china
5400371 the companys credibility is at stake and we urge its shareholders to intervene as quickly as possible so that ntdtv can resume broadcasting on this satellite if that is not done none of the tv companies that are eutelsat clients will ever be sure they could not also be arbitrarily disconnected one day because of their content
5400372 ntdtvs broadcasts irked the chinese government because thanks to this satellite they could be freely received in tens of millions of chinese homes their suspension just a few weeks ahead of the olympic games looks like a favour provided by eutelsat with the aim of obtaining new deals eutelsat tried to drop ntdtv once before in 2005 but an international campaign forced it to sign a new long term contract
5400373 it was our companys ceo in france who decided to stop ntdtvs signal
5400374 eutelsat for years has been trying to find a way to penetrate the chinese market and launch contracts are widely seen as one way to help reach that goal

5400376 and finally its not about charity after all is it its about justice let me repeat that its not about charity its about justice and thats too bad because youre good at charity americans like the irish are good at it we like to give and we give a lot even those who cant afford it but justice is a higher standard africa makes a fool of our idea of justice it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our commitment 6 500 africans are still dying every day of a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can buy at any drug store this is not about charity this is about justice and equality

5400415 it is a great suffering for the church in the united states and for the church is general and for me personally that this could happen

5400449 in the u s theres a photo of a bride on fire well not really on fire but it looked a bit joan of arc it was the shock value
5400450 usually its just getting wet where you can still recover the dress or getting in the sand or mud making it look more like a model shoot than a bridal photo

5400483 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5400484 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies

5400499 the democratic presidential race continues to be tight nationally with barack obama maintaining a narrow lead among democratic primary voters who have already participated in a democratic primary held this year or still plan to obama leads hillary clinton 46 percent to 43 percent those numbers are unchanged from a month ago expectations that obama will become the nominee have grown in the last two weeks with 69 percent of democratic voters now saying they expect him to defeat clinton up from 55 percent in mid march democratic primary voters view obama as the more electable candidate fifty six percent think he is better positioned to beat john mccain in november while only 32 percent think clinton is

5400502 a collegiate beauty contest that is not a valid basis for judging the quality of education
5400503 refuse to fill out the u s news and world report reputation survey and refuse to use the rankings in any promotional efforts on behalf of their college or university
5400504 rankings have reduced students to consumers education to product and gaining admission into college a high priced game that has to be played
5400505 rewards established patterns only without any credence for schools who have made improvements over the years
5400506 while i recognize that the results are subjective it is a way for students to get intangibles about colleges
5400507 we are happy the group did not decide to do a blanket boycott
5400508 but if enough officials dont submit surveys about less known schools those colleges and universities are likely to fall off the ranking list
5400509 i dont think there is anyone in higher education who is not thinking about this issue
5400510 one ranking number does not represent anything about educational quality
5400511 theres a college out there where every student can flourish and grow students dont have to go to the wealthiest or top ranked school to get a good education

5400518 no water in excess of the minimum amount necessary to facilitate normal fermentation may be used in the production or cellar treatment of any grape wine
5400519 this has historically been understood to mean that no water except that minimal amount necessary to facilitate pumping of grapes after crushing for mechanical purposes and for flushing equipment may be added to wine
5400520 no water in excess of that needed to prevent a fermentation from sticking
5400521 most countries are pretty much like california in that you cant add water except in special circumstances
5400522 what really irritates you is that you pull up to the scales weigh the grapes and they then add water we could have done that in the field
5400523 we need to determine whats the risk the grower takes and the loss he makes

5400525 its not just kids my age and older its kids that are 7 8 and sometimes younger and the fact that theyre growing up with music that they can listen to and enjoy and hopefully inspire them i just want the kids to understand the music
5400526 it just excites me that people are still lining up just as much as they were for my character
5400527 here i dont even have the support of a show its just the music the kids understand me and they understand the art of it

5400536 our society is filled with bitter people but are we to blame society our boss our neighbour or maybe a friend that did you wrong the answer to that is i really dont care who did you wrong or what has happened in the past i do believe that many bitter people are simply seeking attention they walk around as if they are mad at the world and seldom listen to anyone no reasoning will make them understand what has turned them so bitter
5400537 conservatives and others are going to use this as an opportunity to bash acorn and by extension every social justice minded nonprofit in the country
5400538 the conservatives are going after acorn for the wrong reasons working for social justice for low income families is a noble pursuit and should be celebrated fraud has nothing to do with acorns mission this didnt happen because of acorns mission it happened because of the greed of dale rathke and the unconscionable acts of a few organization insiders this is a people problem not a mission problem do not be confused

5400571 nervous reaction by washington politicians to poll results in the media
5400572 when we begin to draw down troops from iraq it will be from a position of strength and success not from a position of fear and failure to do so otherwise would embolden our enemies and make it more likely that they would attack us at home

5400579 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5400580 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5400581 in theory working with an unruly fractuous coalition government is more difficult than working with someone who has most of the power in his own hands
5400582 but the problem with the theory in this case is that it never worked very well with musharraf
5400583 musharraf worked with us when it suited his interest and to the extent it suited his interest but i think most of us feel that our partnership with musharraf did not produce the fruits that we had hoped for
5400584 focus their collective minds on the major problems challenging both countries
5400585 what it will do is to remove the automatic link in the pakistani mind that any actions which are taken in the fata and in the frontier generally are american dictated
5400586 weakening that link means that decisions that pakistans going to take is in its own interest
5400587 so if it moves more aggressively it wouldnt be automatically seen as simply carrying out american command
5400588 he only knows one speed and plays every down that way marcus has had a very positive impact on both sides of the football for us
5400589 hes very difficult to block on defense and difficult to tackle when he runs the ball
5400590 he goes very hard whether youre trying to block him or tackle him hes always moving forward
5400591 we said theres no way we can run marcus and brynell middleton and david fluellen at tailback wed be keeping too many good players off the field
5400592 so we moved marcus to fullback and moved our other fullback derek rocco to tight end everyone was willing to do what we asked them to do to make the team better
5400593 honestly i had no idea what to do every year i had a new position and im not the biggest guy in the league me 170 pounds playing fullback but i think i did ok
5400594 my first big problem was all plays were opposite of what id learned at tailback
5400595 that was a big adjustment and took getting used to i would go the wrong way laughs and i also had learn how to block
5400596 were not a one man team every guy does his part every game to try and win
5400597 i just try to do the best that i can everyone doing their part puts me in a position to make those tackles
5400598 you know what youre getting and what youre getting is everything he has
5400599 hes a little unorthodox in his running style and stances but hes very difficult to play against
5400600 i want to be remembered as a person who tried his best every game and tried not to let everyone down someone who played the game to his fullest and tried to do the best that he could

5400624 i started reprap in february 2004 and it is in essence a machine capable of making the components from which itself is made i didnt invent the concept of machine self replication this dates back as far as the 17th century ren descartes and by samuel butler erewhon two centuries later but i was the first to realise it was possible to separate the self copying and self assembling aspects of artificial self replication and that replication was the more important of the two

5400630 the response to this car has been overwhelming so im glad we can share it with more mustang enthusiasts
5400631 this car is really special to me and demonstrates that when shelby automobiles gets together with ford svt and ford racing we can deliver a mustang that will compete with the best in the world
5400632 if you drive a shelby mustang you are part of something special a 40 year history of legendary racing and street cars
5400633 thats what is driving interest in the gt500kr among enthusiasts around the world
5400634 when the mustang came out there were affordable high performance v8 versions available to the lower income bracket ie even high school students brand new

5400639 these amplifiers may be operated as supplied however voltages in excess of 200 volts are present on the board and the tubes get very hot it is advised that the amplifier be mounted in a well ventilated metal enclosure to reduce the potential of fire or shock
5400640 so im also wondering about the safety of surrounding the tubes with wood is this generally a risk for fire
5400641 good judgement comes from experience experience comes from bad judgement
5400642 theyre not learning arithmetic many of our students obviously dont understand mathematics on any conceptual level
5400643 we have a long tradition in mathematics education of stand and deliver
5400644 math instruction has become very uneven from year to year depending on which teacher an individual child has at any given year of school
5400645 the tests set a fairly low standard push teachers to organize instruction towards getting kids over a fairly low bar and they dont provide incentive for developing deep conceptual understanding of important mathematical ideas
5400646 traditionally a teacher will present a problem like john goes to the supermarket he needs 25 lollipops for his party lollipops are only sold in bags of four how many bags should john buy and once the student understands how to work the problem the teacher presents other problems that really only vary in terms of the quantities and the cover stories
5400647 the dilemma for a large number of children is that when they get to the supermarket in real life they cant apply what theyve learned in school because the supermarket situation is more complicated when math problems are embedded in these complex situations its hard for the children to recognize those problems as ones they can know how to solve
5400648 the jar is more manageable than a pond but it still has uncertainties and interactions that are very challenging often the jar system crashes and students have to figure out causes so that their next iteration is more sustainable along the way they typically learn about how interactions among the living and non living components define an ecology
5400649 growth spurts are somewhat surprising because the rates of change are not constant mathematics allows us to track more carefully the form and rate of change things that you cant see with your eyes and if we can represent these phenomena in new ways then we can think about related phenomena with these new ways of seeing for example children often begin to wonder if caterpillars grow like plants or they seek to account for why bacterial growth is also described by the same s curve
5400650 too often students are given mathematical problems that are so disconnected from important ideas that theyre not fun
5400651 in the modeling work rich sets up these interesting problems and the kids want to solve them they become intrigued by the mathematics
5400652 learning how to structure a learning environment is crucial for teachers who want their kids to be excited about math thats harder than it sounds its the difference between posing a question that is really interesting to solve one that can take you somewhere or doing a song and dance around a question to capture kids attention but theres nothing inherently interesting in the question itself
5400653 now we teach calculus quite apart from that yet when students see what questions mathematical systems were invented to address mathematics becomes less disembodied and more about everyday activity and the everyday world we can cultivate interest in mathematics and in science when children learn that they can use these forms of thinking to develop some of their own questions and to express some of their own thoughts mathematics and science are powerful ways of thinking that should be a matter of routine access for all children not restricted to a privileged few
5400654 if you let kids ask questions they will go off in unanticipated directions and they can develop knowledge thats deep but not tested because its hard to test deep knowledge the payoff is that kids are interested and excited but the negative side is they may not know some particular thing that appears on the statewide exam
5400655 its hard to get traction on reform initiatives when high stakes testing is what teachers are held accountable for
5400656 scaling up these kinds of programs has rarely been effective in the united states weve let a thousand flowers bloom meaning we encourage experimentation and creativity but we dont have a workable mechanism for spreading effective practices and programs

5400774 it was foolish of mencius to not realize that the king of qi would never attain the leadership attributes of shang tang king wu of zhou or others despite realizing that the king would never become a capable leader mencius did not give up does this suggest that he wanted to benefit himself mencius traveled from far away to meet with the king and when he did not succeed in his quest mencius stayed in zhou yi and did not leave until three nights later why did he stay im not very pleased with the things mencius did
5400775 how could yin shi know what i was thinking i traveled from far away to advise the king of qi about how to rule a nation and i did so willingly when my suggestions were not accepted i had to leave the kings presence i stayed in zhou yi for three nights even though three nights was too short i waited to see if the king would summon me and i could then try to persuade him however when the king did not ask for my presence i decided to leave although i left i still held hopes that the king of qi would accept my counsel it is not too late for the king to govern the country benevolently should he be able to do that he will bring peace to the people of qi and the rest of the world i still hold the hope that the king may change his mind im not narrow minded just because the king did not accept my advice i hold no anger or discontent i did not leave in a hurry but gave the king the chance to ponder my suggestions

5400874 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5400875 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5400876 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5400877 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

5400880 i wanted to let you know in advance that should i win the contest to meet with sen obama backstage i would like to make a substitution i would like hillary clinton to join barack obama backstage at the democratic national convention instead
5400881 in fact like millions of americans i think sen obama should choose sen clinton as his running mate it would be a true dream ticket hillary is exactly the candidate sen obama is looking for
5400882 felt a big weight come off my shoulders and was enveloped in a sense of euphoria
5400883 but it would be a differnet blog with a different focus and im not sure a lot of you would be as interested
5400884 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website

5400891 we dont have a body we dont have a lot of clues but if these are in fact taped statements they are incriminating they are damaging and i think they are helpful
5400892 theres a lot of suspicion not a lot of evidence
5400893 this is a good brick i like this brick but it doesnt mean weve got the whole house yet
5400894 thats got to be the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard
5400895 that somebody would have a plan to commit murder to be arrested tried and acquitted before a body was found thats just insane to think that somebody would make that kind of plan
5400896 i know that paula for example has filed for bankruptcy five times in the last nine years
5400897 len has filed bankruptcy twice since 2004 these are people that are in a very bad financial situation theyre about to be thrown out of their house and they need money they are trying to make money as other people have made money off of this case
5400898 the illinois state police and the prosecutors if there are tapes with anything incriminating on them would never allow these people to go on the media and talk about it
5400899 its a felony to taint their entire investigation like this would be nuts
5400900 my gun card i found out was being revoked and i had a gun in my possession that i had to get rid of
5400901 those were the only two people available so i made a legal transfer of that firearm to paula stark who had a valid gun card

5400909 i was a little bit surprised but i was thrilled
5400910 mr gibbs feels that the verdict did not accurately reflect the evidence and will appeal
5400911 in addition there are significant legal questions to address including but not limited to whether or not breach of promise to marry is a viable action under georgia law in 2008
5400912 primarily because he made a promise to me and i relied on that promise and gave up a lot of things because of that promise
5400913 i just felt like people shouldnt be allowed to do people that way
5400914 we discussed my debts before i left florida we discussed my debts when i came back from florida he had a list he knew exactly what i owed thats all just kind of a smokescreen
5400915 we really debated quite extensively whether to bring the case
5400916 but we just felt so strongly that in this case he had told her to quit her job and she relied on his promise he came to her in florida and moved her back into his house took steps above and beyond the usual will you marry me lets plan a wedding and then somebody backs out
5400917 really we believe now that he never intended to follow through on the promise to marry
5400918 when you give your word to do something and you cause people to rely on it to their detriment then you may be held accountable for any damages that you cause

5400931 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5400932 the fourth and particularly the fifth millennium development goals on maternal health and child deaths are lagging the farthest behind
5400933 we want to reach new demographic groups with information about the large rates of maternal and child deaths in particularly africa
5400934 the reality for women and girls in tanzania and many other developing countries is so brutally different from the reality in norway that it was important to enable her to talk with the women directly to talk to health workers in the field and then to write and draw what she experienced
5400935 we also believed that the fact that she had not been very far afield before meant that her reactions would be similar to that of many of the norwegians that might read these stories and that she might interpret her experiences in a way with which they can identify
5400936 im also a photographer and with photography it is often difficult to avoid the impression that you are showing some kind of objective reality what i really enjoyed with this project is the fact that comic books are always very subjective because youre viewing my own personal drawings and writing
5400937 its liberating to be able to get away from the illusion of trying to tell the truth about africa and developing countries because people have been served the clich of starving children with flies in their eyes and of the white norwegian going to africa and dictating problems and solutions so many times these stories are shaped by me and readers will know that theyre not necessarily being served the truth but my perception of it
5400938 this story is about how easy it was for us drive the mother and her child to the doctor and the satisfaction we got from saving the boys life but also about the doubts we had later on what kind of a life will the boy have did we do this just to satisfy our own desire to feel good about ourselves or because it really was the right thing to do
5400939 often you hear statistics along the lines of one in 16 mothers die during childbirth and you think oh thats a lot but you cant really relate because its just a figure
5400940 its not just about giving more money or going to africa and saving the world on ones own its about keeping such issues in the back of your mind when for instance voting for political parties or leading your life i want norwegians to care about more than just rising petrol prices
5400941 it might not be usual as regards norwegian aid work but it is increasingly in use as a communication medium and a cultural effort in other areas for instance the united nations population fund unfpa has used comic books in its communications
5400942 our soldiers like top athletes operate under extreme conditions that may well be limited by their physiology
5400943 were now working with the defense department to identify variants of enzymes that are remediable and ultimately hope to identify troops that have these variants and test whether performance can be enhanced by appropriate supplementation
5400944 there are over 600 human enzymes that use vitamins or minerals as cofactors and this study reports just what we found by studying one of them
5400945 what this means is that even if the odds of an individual having a defect in one gene is low with 600 genes we are all likely to have some mutations that limit one or more of our enzymes
5400946 and more than half interfere with the function of the enzyme producing a hundred fold range of enzyme activity
5400947 a few companies have already begun offering diets based on genetic testing for the general public
5400948 its not that the science behind them is bad or sloppy he said its simply that so far we dont know enough yet to leap from a few genetic details to truly individualized diets
5400949 the fast growing field will be huge we are definitely not ready for it

5400953 the themes of talent identification and development that i began to explore there as a student have continued to be the primary focus of my academic work and they have provided a philosophical framework for my efforts in leading peabody college i feel greatly honored by this recognition

5400960 many children and adolescents with disabilities have behavior problems that interfere with typical development and learning
5400961 we moved our minimum age from 5 years old to 3 years old to help support families and children when intense challenging behaviors are initially observed after diagnosis of a developmental disability rather than having a family wait until age 5 which can lead to even more intense challenging behaviors

5400982 we were concerned that health professionals in developing countries would not be able to pay for access to our medical research and would miss information that could be highly relevant to their work
5400983 the vast majority of our medical activities and by extension our research initiatives take place in poorer countries we therefore applaud the willingness of medical publishers to allow us to archive the articles free of charge for the global medical community
5400984 we are absolutely certain that the computer exhibits that our experts examined came from a farc terrorist camp no one can ever question whether or not the colombian government tampered with the seized farc computers

5401023 by the way if you use test unit you should know that as of rails 2 1 default tests cant be run at the command line using the ruby executable you now have to include the test directory explicitly using the i test flag
5401024 while that worked for us in development we ran into an issue on our staging server where we test everything before installing it on our production servers the expected table conversion didnt happen instead the migration tried to recreate the tables from scratch

5401030 we have problems with this route all of the suicide terrorists they come along that road because that is the main road from pakistan
5401031 this is what we call ghulam khan border most of the terrorist people are coming through that way to khost city
5401032 they are telling us that 40 guys came from the mountain and were broadcasting messages telling people not to work for the coalition
5401033 we asked them where they came from they pointed due south
5401034 pakistan is to the south this is very good because this is the first time we have been told about this this is them demonstrating their trust in us
5401035 before when they came the americans they just wrote something down and then left
5401036 we dont have water we dont have electricity we need a barrier to stop the river flooding we are just asking for this from the american people
5401037 what we are really trying to do is to stress government competence
5401038 we are trying to take our face off it and put an afghan face onto it
5401039 the war is a counter insurgency war the word we use is non kinetic and the main efforts are very much non kinetic
5401040 that means talking to a lot of people and becoming friendly with them and showing them that we are here not to put a gun in somebodys face but we are here to pay somebody to turn in mines or build schools
5401041 they have to realise that coalition forces are here doing positive things and not just running around kicking up dust with a bunch of humvees and splashing dust on their yard thats definitely a challenge

5401049 we believe all of the international communities are in the same boat we have the same destiny in afghanistan
5401050 the intelligence reports that we get from our agents in iran say some weapons come into afghanistan
5401051 the weapons which the enemies use these days such as kalashnikov rocket propelled grenades heavy machine guns hand grenades explosives they are not coming from the sky these definitely are coming from across the border
5401052 pakistan is kind of doing it openly but iran is doing it behind the curtain in a secret way helping the taleban or the other opposition of the afghan government
5401053 we examined the charges and unfortunately it is one of the first that is found in afghanistan so there are some concerns about it but hopefully its an isolated case
5401054 in iraq the insurgency developed and they got more and more sophisticated i believe we are seeing the same thing in afghanistan but fortunately they are still quite a long way behind iraq
5401055 i think it was 11 april that a taleban convoy was intercepted in southern afghanistan and there was ammunition and explosives of iranian origin
5401056 who supplied them and why and under what circumstances not yet clear
5401057 strongly denied strongly denied and we are ready to make that clear
5401058 both here and in iraq the iranian governments objectives are probably simply to destabilise the situation and deter the us led coalition from attempting anything against iran
5401059 they play very very long strategic games and do a lot of very traditional interference in neighbouring countries in order to try to defend their own national interests
5401060 the first is the fact that we offer a firewall for free when many competitors charge for theirs and often too much the second part is the fact that comodos firewall pro is the best available and you dont have to take our word for it the results speak for themselves

5401069 we were especially impressed with connies demonstrated ability for relationship building especially with faculty and students
5401070 connie also expressed a deep concern for the needs of the library staff
5401071 in the time dowell has been here the library has been virtually transformed into a new vibrant part of san diego state university
5401072 being asked to return to vanderbilt in this capacity is truly a dream come true

5401096 many films dealt essentially with the social conquests los logros of the revolution what struck me in this documentary was how the movement from below was presented in images the question of the consciousness and the level of organisation was featured something which rarely happens in other films
5401097 muqtada muqtada al sadr the shia revival and the struggle for iraq
5401098 there have been many books on iraq and there are a number of successful books on iraq but the ones written are about americans in iraq they are not about iraqis
5401099 muqtada succeeded in asserting his authority over swathes of shia iraq in a few days because of his own abilities and the legacy of his father
5401100 but he was also riding a wave of shia self assertion that was as overpowering as it was unexpected
5401101 trying to marginalise him and thinking you could marginalise him and of course that was marginalising millions of iraqis and so the popular base of the iraqi government will be small
5401102 i think that muqtada is completely misunderstood in the western media and to some extent within iraq first of all he is a very astute politician otherwise he wouldnt have survived he doesnt like to take on the opponent that he thinks might win
5401103 first it was very difficult to do that and second i didnt want to tell the sadrists what i was doing
5401104 you cant even talk to a commander of mahdi army if they know exactly that you are writing a book on them
5401105 i know you love me and i tolerate you when you scratch under my chin
5401106 no more military bloggers writing about their experiences in the combat zone this is the best pr the military has its most honest voice out of the war zone and its being silenced
5401107 i am extremely disappointed with the pace of the contractor in analyzing and closing potential quality workmanship and testing issues in the viirs program
5401108 the contractors lack of progress on fixing several technical issues is unacceptable and has resulted in significant delays to the original viirs planned delivery
5401109 we will continue to remain vigilant so that the current problems do not have a cost or schedule impact on the npoess program

5401111 researchers at the santa fe institute sfi have shown that its possible to extract automatically the hierarchical structure of networks the researchers say their results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks capable of offering insight into many network phenomena they also think that their algorithms can be applied to almost every kind of networks from biochemical networks protein interaction networks metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks to communities in social networks
5401112 there seem to be at least four degrees of cultural development rooted in degrees of moral insight 1 autocratic cultures which define rights in a limited and oppressive way and there are no rights of political participation 2 narrow democratic cultures which practice political participation through representation but have no or very limited participation of people in decision making in all other realms such as research religion education industry etc 3 wider democratic cultures which practice both political participation and varying degree of wider kinds of participation 4 commons p2p cultures in a libertarian and abundance oriented global network with equipotential rights of participation of everyone in every field of human endeavor
5401113 these four degrees could be stated in terms of the relations between hierarchy co operation and autonomy
5401114 the first is that the activities be influential that is noncoercive the second is that the activities be done by people in a relationship the third is that the activities involve a real significant change and the fourth element is that the activities reflect the purposes of the people in the relationship not just a single person all of these standards insure collaboration rather than the notion that leadership is a great leader doing great things
5401115 i define rank thinking as the belief that only a few in any organization should be given special privilege to monopolize information control decision making and command obedience from the vast majority either through coercive or manipulative power peer thinking on the other hand is the belief that everyone in the organization should have equal standing to share in information participate in the decision making process and choose to follow through persuasive means peer thinking assumes that we each have equal privilege to speak and an obligation to listen peer based organizations create a space an arena where we come to recognize and respect one another as equal participants in organizational life
5401116 first diversity did the process involve the widest possible spectrum of points of view did people who interpret the matter one way and from one set of background assumptions interact with with people who approach the matter from a different perspective
5401117 there seem to be at least four degrees of cultural development
5401118 i think we leave this dimension out of the equation at our peril
5401119 the big question of course is what would be the criteria for deciding that someone is acting in an anti social way and should be excluded
5401120 the co evolution of the collective and the self take on a new meaning awareness of meaning conflict and projection moving through the community becomes a means to ones own individual development
5401121 herbert simons distinction between command hierarchies and markets may turn out to be a special case of a more general dichotomy
5401122 i was from a poor white family from the south and i did badly in school i was filet mignon for recruiters they started phoning me when i was in 10th grade
5401123 stomach churning testimony of the horrors and crimes taking place in iraq
5401124 for fear of retaliation from the military i failed to report these crimes never again will i allow fear to silence me
5401125 i joined the army to kill people i joined the army to kill iraqis to kill muslims to kill people that were a skin tone other than mine and inhabiting the middle east
5401126 i want to state that i have since changed i am no longer a racist i am no longer filled with hatred like that but that is what drove me even harder to join the army and to fight in combat
5401127 before i go on i want to say that i do not blame you as congress members for not ending the war as many americans do i do not blame the president for not ending the war i blame the people of america and their apathy because they are you are responsible for following what they say and they have not done a good enough job to convince the rest of your peers namely republicans to fight to bring our troops home and save lives in both america and iraq
5401128 this is more than good corporate citizenship running a sustainable business is about pursuing our vision of tomorrow while serving our stakeholders well today this report focuses on our past and future efforts to do that
5401129 corporate sustainability is a business approach that creates long term shareholder value by embracing opportunities and managing risks deriving from economic environmental and social developments
5401130 this new report adopts the best of both publications and with earth day this weekend we felt this was an appropriate time to introduce our first sustainability annual report
5401131 a key cornerstone of our partner success has been our newly developed affiliate system that is designed to sell all comodo products with zero integration
5401132 we can support a broader range of partners with a greater suite of products enabling them to be up and running within an extremely quick time frame
5401133 it was a judgment call at the time and looking back people can agree or disagree with it but we did what we thought was right
5401134 there is a great amount of talent in our area
5401135 we have done everything using local trades people and it shows what we can achieve in our own area
5401136 we cant thank them enough for putting in the extra effort and expertise to make this happen
5401137 in 2007 victims seeking sane services increased more than 30 percent from 2006
5401138 this increase is directly attributed to program awareness and to the incredible team of law enforcement prosecution and community organizations whom work together to assist victims
5401139 we are focused on raising awareness in our communities this year by creating a buzz about sexual violence
5401140 when businesses have prevent sexual violence on their marquee signs we know it will encourage residents to talk about this issue at home at work at church and with friends this type of discussion will help prevent future sexual violence
5401141 we expect more than 700 coffee cups to get into residents hands further increasing awareness

5401143 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5401144 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5401145 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5401146 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5401147 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5401148 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room

5401157 right where we were almost when the first building collapsed there was a huge collapse a big wall of stuff and it was on fire
5401158 all of a sudden the forty seven story building before us begins to shake
5401159 i had a clear view down washington street of building seven which was on the north edge of the site

5401168 what happens if in three years time iran has a nuclear weapon
5401169 im not sure that is going to happen but if it does what do we do they are rational people like all of us in this room do they want to commit suicide i would guess not so what we have to do is talk with them now and say to them we want to be their friends
5401170 if someone tells you he has a new interpretation of islam sock him in the mouth
5401171 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism

5401175 i was pinned to seven co eds all at the same time id already decided to become a dentist and never lift anything heavier than a poker chip
5401176 one day we go in to town to see a movie and after we buy our tickets they tell us we have to go around to the back and up the stairs to sit in the coloured balcony the crows nest we asked for our quarters back and they refused we got angry and pulled down a bunch of curtains and broke a door and ran like hell
5401177 am i going to go through life being humiliated because of the colour of my skin
5401178 one time were defending two negroes charged with murder in a race riot in columbia tennessee near the birthplace of the ku klux klan word was out theyd kill us if we tried to sleep in that town so we drive 45 miles to nashville every night were leaving town just after sunset i spot three or four state police cars and were pulled over im at the wheel they say they have a warrant to search our car
5401179 the sheriff says this is the one you get out the car
5401180 they shove me in a police car between two beefy deputies holding shotguns and drive off suddenly the car turns off the road and heads through the woods toward the river we get to a place where a bunch of men are waiting under a big tree with a rope hanging over it fixin to do a little bit of lynching then the car with my friends catches up so i guess these deputies get cold feet they turn around and drive me to town
5401181 the little magistrate is five foot nothing he says whats up
5401182 i got myself on the fastest goddamn train out of there and i had a drink i sat with a bottle of wild turkey and thanked the lord and i thought about the negroes who stayed behind they were the heroes
5401183 this overwhelmingly suggests that segregation has a detrimental effect on the personality development of these negro children they like other human beings who are subjected to an inferior status are irreparably harmed

5401194 that early geometry work leads to higher mathematics achievement higher writing readiness and higher iq scores in the primary grades
5401195 its user friendly child friendly and developmentally appropriate it uses lots of manipulatives ive really enjoyed it and the children enjoy it our play is our work and our work is our play
5401196 the activities are developmentally aligned with how children understand mathematical concepts
5401197 it allows them to build on their intuitive understanding of math and to build on it in a complex way in the future it asks questions like how did you do that and what makes you think that encouraging them to explain the concepts for themselves kids are delighted to get a chance to talk and it solidifies their conceptual understanding
5401198 last year was our initial training year you cant expect teachers to do things out of the box and this is especially complex
5401199 this year is our first full implementation year we have facilitators meeting regularly with teachers
5401200 would require genuine commitment by school districts you need to be committed to helping teachers transition to this way of teaching i think thats true of almost any good curriculum
5401201 the thing i really like and what the teachers tell me is that it reaches into what the child can understand in the world and can think about in a mathematical way
5401202 its about understanding math concepts looking for defining features and quantity comparing quantities and finding relationships among things
5401203 i want our teachers to be conscious of bringing more math into the curriculum
5401204 its part of everyday life it can be embedded not only in school but in everything kids do shopping weights measures everywhere
5401205 we have a specific math time in the week but i embed math concepts in other activities such as art and dramatic play
5401206 the best way for them to learn is to have multiple opportunities to learn
5401207 one book we read was all about hockey we talked about the numbers on the uniforms how many games they had to win and other ways math is related to the sport
5401208 you really have to build from where the children are
5401209 for children who arent at age level you need to find things that are relevant to them
5401210 the members of the iotc committee have attracted a great line up of speakers for the irish tech community and i believe well have a full house in dublins
5401211 we are filming and streaming the iotc sessions live on the iotc website which is going live on 1st june this will open up the event to people who live abroad or simply cannot make it to dublin for the event of course the online interaction does not afford the same benefits as being in the same room as the speakers and other delegates but at least people need not miss a minute

5401223 unitaid has shown great vision and understanding of what needs to be done this could potentially have a big impact both for access to medicines and for medical innovation
5401224 whether this works or not now depends on the willingness of patent holders to share in exchange for royalties the relevant patent rights in the pool
5401225 we need to find ways to get new drug prices down
5401226 today we pay at best between us 613 and 1 033 for the newer who recommended regimen for first line aids treatment this is a seven to twelve fold increase compared to older first line treatments which are now available for 87 for one patients yearly treatment as weve seen with the older antiretrovirals to treat aids increased competition is the best way to do that a patent pool can foster this competition
5401227 patent pools also open up the possibility of developing more fixed dose combinations which combine several drugs into one pill
5401228 patents on the individual components of a fixed dose combination can stand in the way of the development and production of an fdc a patent pool gets round that by offering producers a one stop shop for licences from the different intellectual property owners generic companies obtain licences against the payment of royalties that will enable them to put the different components of a fixed dose combination together the same is true for the development of more child friendly medicines

5401251 we need leaders to open their eyes to the needs of young children who are most vulnerable right now and for whom more of the same could put them at risk
5401252 one critical question this week is will donors change the rules so that appropriate food for young children is added to food aid and nutrition programmes

5401276 polemisch guter aufmacher den wetm ller zu zitieren und es als
5401277 die inhaltiche kritik wird dadurch nicht nichtig nur weil das
5401278 bei der inhaltlichen kritik an der bahamas ist es unerheblich welcher autor ansich diese zitat gebracht hat vielmehr geht es darum dass zum einen ein weitergehender kritik text im anschluss an die
5401279 sch n das du deinen artikel mit der unterstellung beginnst dass ich gelogen habe und damit beendest dass es hier um nichts anderes als
5401280 dies seien blo zwei nachtr gliche korrekturen die die inhaltliche ebene der
5401281 das du den inhalt nicht ber hren willst soll in anbetracht deiner usserungen auch nicht weiter verwundern das die diskussion auf die du dich hier beziehst n mlich durchaus inhaltlicher natur war l sst du bewusst aussen vor
5401282 stattdessen wird der artikel zum paradebeispiel paranoider antideutscher die bei einem angriff auf ihre identit tsstiftende szenepostille gleich meinen man h tte es
5401283 ein wunder dass man nicht gleich als antisemit und oder feind israels denunziert wird
5401284 weiter aber erstmal mit einem eingest ndniss ja ich habe die
5401285 habe ich die vermutung ge ussert dass wir da eventuell zwei unterschiedliche versionen des textes gelesen haben k nnten
5401286 dieser umstand ist ja jetzt aufgekl rt hat aber f r dich keine konsequenzen
5401287 so geht es nicht darum das die verharmlosung einer vergewaltigung als schlechter sex eben doch in der bahamas ver ffentlich wurde nein dir geht es hier um ehrenrettung f r wertm ller und krug
5401288 man mag von diesen zeilen halten was man m chte
5401289 das du nicht feststellen kannst das die redaktion eine vergewaltigung verharmlost soll auch nicht weiter verwundern st tzt sich deine erkenntniss und die der autoren eben auf ein ger cht wie es gewesen sein soll und nicht auf die klare usserung des opfers
5401290 aus der ganzen sache wird nichts weiter als ein ungl cklicher abend zweier ehemals verliebter die sich im eifer des gefechts etwas bernommen haben und mit einem
5401291 aus dem lust machen das schon in der aussage des opfers in anf hrungstriche gesetzt ist und damit wohl eher als eine wieder aufgegriffene usserung des t ters zu verstehen ist wird kurzerhand eine lustfeindschaft mehr noch das
5401292 am ende einer debatte die nie eine war weil die teilnehmer gegen das argument genauso resistent sind wie gegen die zur verhandlung stehende realit t herrschen ha und feigheit das begriffsarsenal ist auf zwei w rter partriarchat und definitionsmacht zusammengeschrumpft
5401293 der held des kleinen dramas also hat es noch einmal wissen wollen und alles was ihm an charme und k rperlicher ausstrahlung zur verf gung stand noch einmal massiv zum einsatz gebracht fast wie in den besten zeiten und es ist ihm gelungen zum ziel zu kommen

5401295 der text von sinistra und gigi gehen m e zur gen ge auf das thema ein darum das ganz hier eher fragmentarisch
5401296 es sei noch angemerkt das ich kein interesse an einer diskussion habe da fehlen mir zeit und lust zu mal ganz abgesehen davon das es ankotzt dieses thema wieder und wieder diskutieren zu m ssen so long
5401297 ich rate dir dringends an dich mit otto zeigers text zu besch ftigen und vielleicht auch in anschluss an deinen text noch einmal deinen standpunkt darzulegen
5401298 das es sich bei der bahamas um eine plattform handelt innerhalb derer texte ver ffentlich werden k nnen zeigt trotzem welches geiste kind sie sind wenn bestimmte texte eben der kritiktext oder weitergehende text an der
5401299 dann schlie lich geht es nicht mehr darum anzusto en oder hinzuweisen sondern einfach um billigsten polemischen identit ren unsinn punkt
5401300 ich kann gute fee in manchen punkten zustimmen sehe aber bei euerer auseinandersetzung vor allem einen durch befindlichkeiten gekennzeichneten unsinn

5401304 die ankl gerin nennt auch ganz klar einen v llig anderen grund ihr wurde lust gemacht gemeinhin nennt man das sic verf hrung und verf hrung hat wenn sie gelingt zur folge da aus einem nein ein ja wird die urspr ngliche intention nicht mit dem mann schlafen zu wollen ist einem neuen willen gewichen

5401441 the irbs financial results from the final year of the four year business cycle paint a healthy picture for the game net revenues for the period were 130 3 million as adjusted for international financial reporting standards the vast majority of the revenue generated is in respect of rugby world cup which generated a surplus of 122 4 million underlining the 2007 tournaments stature as the most successful rugby world cup ever
5401442 the confirmation of the record rwc surplus will allow the irb to continue the roll out of substantial investment in the game over the next four years for the 2006 2008 period the irb invested 30 million in the game to fund its expansion and increase its competitiveness and now it will embark on a further 48 million investment programme over the next four years
5401443 when you add additional irb expenditure in the form of annual union grants tournament assistance funding and education and training programme expenditure a total of 153 million will be invested in the game during the 2009 2012 period this expenditure will require the irb to draw 38 million out of its reserves
5401444 rugby world cup 2007 was a significant commercial success the surplus from the tournament was almost double the 64 3 million generated by rugby world cup 2003 in australia demonstrating an increasing appetite for the game both in traditional rugby markets but also across emerging rugby markets such as russia india china and north africa
5401445 this increase in surplus reflects the tournaments return to the european marketplace and includes increased broadcasting sponsorship licensing and hospitality revenues for the first time in rugby world cup history france 2007 boasted a full sponsorship inventory featuring six worldwide partners and six official sponsors while the commercial ticketing programme was a resounding success exceeding 100 000 sales which was more than the 1999 and 2003 tournaments combined there was also a significantly increased contribution from france as the host union the strength of the euro was also a positive factor

5401462 the college board continues to advocate for need based aid so that more students can have the opportunity to benefit from a college education
5401463 though student aid makes it possible for many students from low and middle income families to afford college we still face inequality in access to higher education across ethnic racial and economic lines

5401487 we have expanded gse from one month to two this year to allow enough time to complete all of the wonderful projects proposed by our employees and retirees
5401488 our employees and retirees are the companys greatest ambassadors and this program provides an ideal way for them to give back to the communities we serve

5401492 many businesses are aware that linux is the most stable secure and cost effective server operating system available but are often reluctant to migrate because they also perceive linux as difficult to configure and use
5401493 zero touch linux helps to ease this situation by providing a single clean install of an entire back office server infrastructure that is effortlessly managed through a central web interface
5401494 we left our demonstration a bit giddy wic looked great and the new content is a nice touch but what had us so excited was the control scheme this is simply the best console rts control scheme weve seen yet
5401495 the controls seem easy and intuitive yet arent nerfed in any way from the pc version and there will be new content on top of the already excellent battle scenarios that are in the game in other words color us excited about world in conflict soviet assaults release on the xbox 360 this fall
5401496 artisans of all types including chefs were often imprisoned or even executed because of their freethinking to alleviate persecution some chefs sought refuge in the orthodox church and hid amongst the priests of the monasteries there they wore the same clothes as the priests including their tall hats and long robes
5401497 the folded pleats of a toque which later became an established characteristic of the chefs hat were first said to have been added to indicate the more than 100 ways in which a chef can cook an egg

5401499 society views capital punishment as excessive punishment for child rape
5401500 today no western nation authorizes the death penalty for any kind of rape
5401501 public outrage over the sexual violation of immature young children by predatory adults is extremely great due to the recognition that these offenders target and harm the most vulnerable members of our society

5401513 a discussion of qos in an iptv context is actually three separate but nested concerns video quality vq which refers to the video content itself conformance to color and resolution benchmarks which in many cases is mandated contractually by the content owner video quality of service v qos which refers to the error free video delivery from the operators facilities to the customer premises over the broadband wide area network and quality of experience qoe which refers to the overall iptv user experience including application responsiveness functionality usability and the service context that surrounds it
5401514 to prevent the customer from defecting to a competitor churn the operator has to pay careful attention to technical factors across the deployment which is best viewed as an iptv delivery ecosystem
5401515 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5401516 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5401517 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5401518 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

5401527 and a lot of people in his village were muslim he didnt practice islam truth is he wasnt very religious he met my mother my mother was a christian from kansas and they married and then divorced i was raised by my mother so ive always been a christian the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country but ive never practiced islam
5401528 as enjoying playing football and marbles and of being a very devout muslim
5401529 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
5401530 we previously often asked him to the prayer room close to the house
5401531 we prayed but not really seriously just following actions done by older people in the mosque but as kids we loved to meet our friends and went to the mosque together and played
5401532 his mother often went to the church but barry was muslim he went to the mosque
5401533 i remembered that he had studied menjaji recitation of the quran
5401534 the same pullout that mr obama proposed when chaos in iraq appeared to him inevitable
5401535 if god is not for us and against whites we had better kill him
5401536 love your black neighbor as you love yourself but hate white people
5401537 never proud of america until barack won the democratic nomination raising the prospect that the existing
5401538 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5401539 sky you are not that far removed from that situation yourself

5401541 some kick and yell but will not be able to stop the south american revolution unasur is a project of the change unleashed in this last decade which could be the driving force of changes around the world
5401542 only in unity will we later have progressively complete political economic cultural scientific technological and military independence
5401543 weve got money and we will help you pay these debts
5401544 the imf has lost almost all influence in latin america with lending there plummeting to a paltry 50 million less than 1 of its global loan portfolio
5401545 petroleum is going to run out eventually so why are we selling it for the development of countries that are already developed
5401546 let us launch telesur by combining the state televisions of our countries
5401547 are you part of us the latin americans your history your culture is also ours or are you just a lackey of the u s because if you are then youre excluded from our club
5401548 id still like to be frands and yada yada yada
5401549 eh heh heh baby its cool and all but do you think we could slow down a little
5401550 slow down but ive already told all my readers that im totally in luurrve with you what will they think
5401551 hey looks like theres a line must be a good place
5401552 im presenting at iotc to continue hopefully to get across to people the best ways of getting involved and making the most of open source a lot of emphasis is placed on the cost effectiveness and reliability of open source and those are true but what many people miss are the benefits that come from actually getting involved in an open source project even steps as light as voting for bugs or a simple mail to a development list can make an enormous difference
5401553 i said to barack you know this is pretty unbelievable like a rock star
5401554 he said yeah but it might be a little worse tomorrow
5401555 i believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity i believe we can provide jobs to the jobless homes to the homeless and reclaim young people in cities across america from violence and despair i believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us
5401556 the entire concept behind home is flawed i just dont ever see me sitting at the xmb and choosing to go to home rather than actually playing a game i know a lot of other people think it will be fun but sony has to convinve me there is going to be content that makes me actually choose to log in than play a real game
5401557 none of your business keep your mouth shut its none of your business
5401558 lookie there i have mine trained too you old hag and without leashes
5401559 i was trying to tell you what he was telling her to do
5401560 woof woof can i have a scooby snack too woof
5401561 im sure some of you out there reading this may not see any problem with this or perhaps you use or have used leashes on your children yourself so let me just go ahead and say that i really dont want to offend you but omg i think you absolutely suck for doing that
5401562 run until your leash catches you and yanks you back
5401563 do you also complain about the times you sit in a waiting room and the kids are running around loose and the parent ignores them
5401564 i always say that i wanted to own a house and this is the way im doing it now
5401565 im just trying to find nice people along the way and make friends
5401566 my favorite sports series is looking even better this year i cant wait
5401567 daniel sorensen was one of the highlights of the scrimmage on saturday not only in special teams but the way he is playing defense
5401568 and when we look at the mold of who we are looking at for that spot we have played our best defense with guys like bryan kehl and david nixon on the edges
5401569 so i think sorensens future will be there and we will try to feed him the defense as fast as we can
5401570 but hes not afraid hes anxious to contribute and he has already shown that he will be a special teams player for us and this gives us a chance to train him for now and the future
5401571 eventually we might get it caught up where either mike alisa or daniel sorensen could be ready
5401572 and i would not be running for president if i did not revere this country i would not be standing here if it wasnt for this country and ive said this again theres no other country in which my story is even possible
5401573 lord come down in a mighty way and strengthen us so that we can bring down these high gas prices
5401574 prayer is the answer to every problem in life we call on god to intervene in the lives of the selfish greedy people who are keeping these prices high
5401575 lord the prices at this pump have gone up since last week we know that you are able that you have all the power in the world
5401576 well have lower gas prices well have lower gas prices
5401577 these prices will come down just like the walls of jericho came down in the bible
5401578 i cannot find any easy code samples for my specific task assignment to copy out

5401582 how do i convince my mom to let me get my belly button pierced
5401583 let me ask the member whether he thinks home affairs minister wong kan seng ought to resign because of this
5401584 although low thia khiang is very smart he seldom debates on the core substance of policies he seems more keen on catching the government on its shortcomings so as to embarrass the government his attitude is that his responsibility is just to criticise government policies and not to propose alternatives
5401585 yes as minister wong had direct oversight of the internal security department he should lead by example and he ought to resign
5401586 no out of respect for the prime minister i am willing to give minister wong a chance and trust the prime ministers call nevertheless minister wong has categorically given his word to parliament that his team will eventually track mas selamat down and arrest him i am willing to give minister wong time if he fails to deliver he ought to resign
5401587 maybe but i am not the prime minister and unlike the prime minister i have not read the detailed reports if the prime minister discloses that information fully to me i will be happy to provide a more definitive answer
5401588 the current advice from the f d a is insufficient
5401589 very unwise to wait until we have complete scientific truth
5401590 current evidence does not support the hypothesis that consumption of even large amounts of fish during pregnancy places the fetus at neurodevelopmental risk from mehg exposure
5401591 we looked at u s landfalling hurricanes because it is the most reliable atlantic hurricane measurement over the long term
5401592 using data extending back to the middle nineteenth century we found a gentle decrease in the trend of u s landfalling hurricanes when the global ocean is warmed up this trend coincides with an increase in vertical wind shear over the tropical north atlantic and the gulf of mexico which could result in fewer u s landfalling hurricanes
5401593 the vertical wind shear is not the only factor affecting atlantic hurricane activity although it is an important one
5401594 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5401595 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5401596 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5401597 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5401598 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5401599 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5401600 oh no no im not in the group yet im afraid i just blue myself
5401601 not a real nose got a picture of her when she was fourteen in a swimming cap she looks like a falcon
5401602 it seems as though i may have stumbled on an acting opportunity
5401603 come on michael do the right thing bang this blind chick so dad doesnt have to repay his debt to society
5401604 hey guy they tell me youre the actor who plays martas brother tio

5401606 no i was ashamed to be seen with you i like being with you
5401607 how can you say that shh thought i heard my mom whispers how can you say that
5401608 you know the feeling that youre feeling is just what many of us call a feeling
5401609 i know what an erection feels like michael no its the opposite its like my heart is getting hard
5401610 moving to california is definitely next on our priority list after we finish up some college work here in seattle we will be doing all we can to set up home base somewhere near los angeles with all of the opportunities for performing and promotion down there it is something we are looking forward to we want our fans to know that we are working hard to write and record some great music that is going to be very symbolic of who we are as artists so many people have reached out to us and given us words of support and encouragement we appreciate it all so much and everyday are more and more surprised and flattered by the messages and letters our listeners are sending it is our ultimate hope to someday tour and see all these fans in person we dont have a record deal yet this project is more of a demo than a full fledged album the record we are working on is about 75 complete we still have to finish writing and recording a few songs to make sure we have material that is not only work were proud of but a collection that is as diverse and well rounded after that we will spend some time mastering the tracks and making sure all of the kinks are worked out its our first time really doing something like this by ourselves everything from the song writing recording and mixing to the vocals and instrumentals are being done by us alone its a big task to undertake but this is something weve always wanted to do music is our life and we couldnt imagine living without it
5401611 we tried out for the last season of american idol
5401612 i really think bikes are made for people who wear heels
5401613 you dont have to walk in them its so much better
5401614 ive altered it for the better and only one thing that i dont wear now that i bike so much is long full skirts
5401615 i always have a small binder clip in my handbag as well to keep wrap skirts or dresses closed while pedaling
5401616 if i ride in marin i absolutely wear the helmet but in the city when you look more like an average person i think drivers treat you that way they give you a little room treat you nicer
5401617 oh he must have really wanted you to follow in his footsteps
5401618 now if you cut this in real life you would be sued
5401619 a need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species homo sapiens second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter millions survive without love or home almost none in silence the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives from the small accounts of our days events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths
5401620 that jeremy would sacrifice what he had worked so hard to achieve and had been so excited about
5401621 they would say they are following us harassing our landlord i did not see any evidence of that
5401622 but it got to be something that was huge to them a youre either with us or against us thing where if you didnt believe them you werent on their side the story they had woven in paranoia and conspiracies took over part of their lives a lot of us couldnt understand that acting out
5401623 explosions could be heard within the building and authorities cordoned off a zone some 500 metres in diameter in case it should collapse
5401624 we were looking at two large bodies of fires that neither of us in our 33 year careers had ever seen anything that enormous
5401625 it was the most unbelievable sight i ever saw up until that point i had been in some very busy units during my time in the fire department i broke in in engine 46 and ladder 27 in the south bronx when the south bronx was burning down i was in rescue 3 which was extremely busy they covered the bronx and harlem and then as a lieutenant i was in the lower east side when that was burning down as a captain i was in chinatown i saw some unbelievable fires in chinatown what i saw pales in comparison sic to anything else i had seen previously
5401626 sounded like an m 80 thats how loud they were
5401627 sounded like bombs like a bomb going off i mean it was huge
5401628 the flashlight led us into borders bookstore up an escalator and out to church street there were explosions going off everywhere i was convinced that there were bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons i was afraid to go down church street toward broadway but i had to do it i ended up on vesey street there was another explosion and another i didnt know where to run
5401629 everywhere you turned there was someone taking bodies out of the rubble
5401630 there were 20 cars and trucks police cars and emergency vehicles on fire
5401631 then you could see little fires like paper fires i remember just walking up that block that first block all the cars were on fire they werent totally engulfed in flames but there was fire on them and their tires were exploding walking up that block everything was quiet except for the explosions of tires and stuff like that
5401632 on the southwest corner of vesey and west there was a parking lot that was just roaring every car was transmitting to the next car
5401633 the scott cylinders firefighters air packs and the oxygen cylinders were all letting go they were blowing up left and right
5401634 we continued our efforts until the combination of dust smoke and secondary explosions along with reports of gas main leaks bombs small arms fire and buildings about to collapse forced us to again relocate further north on west street
5401635 it was like snow flakes coming down with no one around
5401636 the ambulance blew up then the fire truck blew up six police cars blew up one after the other in one of the most bizarre rationalizations attempted by a 9 11 truther dr steven e jones posits that the vehicles and somehow
5401637 the vast majority of firefighters testimony contend that explosives or secondary devices were used in the building
5401638 i dont care about those distinct booms distinctly fake that is but the rumbling sound
5401639 118 witnesses the firefighters testimony to explosions in the twin towers
5401640 i believe most of the terms on which my research focuses such as
5401641 not that there was an explosion but that the windows blew out
5401642 that debate ended pretty quickly because tower 1 came down
5401643 you can feel the air pressure building up i mean literally it blows the windows in the north tower from outside
5401644 the rest of the day we spent running from bomb scares and gas leaks
5401645 convinced that bombs were planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons
5401646 over 23 per cent of our group of 503 first responders are explosion witnesses
5401647 the oral histories show that many people who originally thought they had witnessed critical explosions were later persuaded that they had not and it appears that the pancake hypothesis was the main alternative they were offered
5401648 there better not be a halligan around id put it through his fucking skull
5401649 the key reason is that two sided platforms must solve a chicken and egg problem for example without sufficient applications developed for it an operating system has no value for and therefore cannot attract users without a solid user base no application developer will be interested in supporting that operating system if the platform vendor decides to charge positive prices on both sides it might end up attracting neither the same goes for dating clubs game consoles and so on so the idea is to subsidize one side in order to attract it more or less irrespectively of the other side and then turn to the second side and charge it positive prices

5401654 five years on no justice for sexual violence in darfur
5401655 women and girls in darfur are still living under the constant threat of rape
5401656 the sudanese government has declared zero tolerance for sexual violence yet has done almost nothing to protect these victims
5401657 he said if we went with him he would show us he grabbed me and took off my clothes to do bad things to me my younger sister ran back to the camp
5401658 the victims of these horrific attacks have little or no hope of redress in darfurs current climate of impunity
5401659 by failing to prosecute the perpetrators the government is giving them a license to rape
5401660 it wont fix the problem but well feel better about it
5401661 we are disappointed the supreme court overturned the lower court rulings in our favor on this matter
5401662 we continue to believe we have solid defenses against the governments claims and will show in the lower courts that our power plant projects were not subject to nsr

5401664 theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comic book industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are
5401665 but domestic affair its like whats going on in the nation but its also me being drawn to all these domestic tasks knitting cooking caring for small children
5401666 what weve been fearing all afternoon has apparently happened weve been watching number seven world trade which was part of the ancillary damage of the explosion and collapse of the other two

5401883 in may 2004 after a 52 day trial involving some of his many insurers mr silverstein lost his first effort to claim that the two planes represented two attacks and required double payments at the end of 2004 however after a separate 35 day trial he won the right to collect double payments from another set of insurers he had spent about 100 million paying lawyers to fight this particular fight which critics said was an unconscionable siphoning of money that should have been used for rebuilding but in his mind that 100 million produced an additional 1 1 billion for rebuilding ground zero which was worth it the insurers had portrayed mr silverstein as what the hell phrase did they use mr silverstein said not greedy not overreaching begins with an r rapacious in his scheme to recover as much insurance money as possible but in an indication that his legal position was not that exotic the port authority after mr silverstein won the second case quietly filed its own lawsuit seeking a double payout on its own insurance policy when mr silverstein applied for 3 35 billion in tax exempt liberty bonds to help finance the freedom tower and his other buildings on the site mr bloomberg found a lever the city and the state each control half those bonds and the mayor said that he would not agree to the citys half unless mr silverstein made certain concessions mr silverstein needed the liberty bonds because insurance proceeds which amounted to about 4 6 billion would not nearly cover the expected costs of the five towers mr silverstein and the port authority together had spent more than 1 5 billion of the insurance money already including more than 500 million for mr silversteins rent to the port authority about 190 million for the port authority to buy out westfield americas retail rights and more than 700 million to repay mr silversteins lender gmac and to repay mr silverstein and his partners most of their equity
5401884 the real fear is not that the iranians will be crazy enough or stupid enough to launch a missile at israel but that they will have no compunction about providing rogue regimes and terror organizations like hamas and hizbullah with weapons of mass destruction
5401885 the palestinians real tragedy is that they have not been able to produce a nelson mandela
5401886 if you can help monitor the quality of a network what advice do you have on building a high quality network
5401887 self explanation is a very promising way to get people to understand things better
5401888 its been shown in a large number of studies across a diverse age group that kids learn more if theyre explaining things
5401889 at the core of my research im looking at kids explaining
5401890 but then also at what things matter what if you put explanation in combination with direct instruction what if you have kids explaining to somebody else what if youre having them explain contrasting ways of doing things these are all different ways of figuring out how to maximize explanation
5401891 did not start studying how children learn math because i always loved it
5401892 at the core im interested in how people develop both conceptual understanding and problem solving skills
5401893 mathematics is an obvious domain where we have to develop both of those kinds of knowledge and integrate them somehow
5401894 from day one as a psychologist i wanted to study tasks that people really do i didnt need to make up a lab task that was weird and convoluted because there are plenty of math tasks out there that to kids seem weird and convoluted
5401895 it strikes people as odd initially that you think about algebraic thinking in a four or five year old
5401896 but when you look at the misconceptions and confusion in older students it appears that they are gaining them from earlier instruction the hope now is that if you go younger there are things students could be thinking about that would productively both avoid these misconceptions or at least reduce them and get students thinking algebraically from a much younger age
5401897 algebra has become a required class for high school graduation
5401898 and some people say its like a requirement to good jobs kids really need to succeed at algebra and they really struggle with it
5401899 psychologists are interested in learning processes and math education researchers are interested in the content learned
5401900 if you can turn to cognitive science literature and say this idea of having kids self explain time and time again people have found its a really good idea then that seems like a good thing to try in the classroom
5401901 that kind of collaboration is really the only way this range of issues is going to be addressed
5401902 when we went back to one of the classrooms we worked in the year before
5401903 30 percent of students were doing certain things at pretest the year before it was zero that wasnt so great for our study but it was an indicator that we had changed the teachers working practices to incorporate these things

5401905 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5401906 but unfortunately theres a very limited diversity pipeline in the u s at the present time so when someone comes up with a unique innovative and interesting new idea and brings the positive power that john does it has the potential to have a dramatic impact in the next five ten 20 years
5401907 both my parents are educators and i still didnt understand what business was all about
5401908 and often the students dont know what theyre looking for either
5401909 he sat and listened and somewhere in the middle he said sean you went to hotchkiss brown graduated magna cum laude you have a great gpa great gmat score you worked at morgan stanley mckinsey
5401910 if youre a doctor or lawyer you can work in the communities you care about being an affordable pediatrician or a lawyer defending youth of color in the legal system
5401911 we had a big party with latin music blasting and we were all dancing and this guy says to me i cant believe all these successful latinos are here like we couldnt succeed in corporate america and still dance salsa
5401912 you went to college to get a great job now you have a great job and you want to leave it to go back to school go into more debt and come out looking for another great job it just doesnt make sense
5401913 and its not 20 years off hes intense and very tactical but hes still a big kid goofy in a suit and the first on the dance floor they want to be like him and they want to be liked by him
5401914 thats where were going and i really think we need to get back on the highway
5401915 were going to be here for about an hour and while were in there i want you to plot out a course in your head to get us from here to my office as quickly as possible can you do that for me before we get back
5401916 my father wanted to change the world and he thought he could do that through monetary policy
5401917 but he realized you have to have economic power to really shape the world and that always stuck with me
5401918 i think the five people whod talked to me at lunch put up their hands
5401919 where i came from just thinking about an ivy league school was like wow but then i got to mlt and met all these ivy league students and i realized i can do this theyre just normal people
5401920 if you look at nonprofits there are usually a lot of people who have their hearts in the right place but mlt people amp have their minds wrapped around what theyre doing and theyre doing it with a textbook approach to supply and demand
5401921 he would probably say hes more of a demotivational speaker than a motivational one because hes so demanding
5401922 i know youre in mlt so if your application isnt perfect im going to think somethings wrong with you
5401923 i definitely could have gotten into business school but would i have gotten into the three that i applied to never
5401924 when you go from not knowing if you could get into business school to getting into the four top schools you applied to youre not just an ambassador its hard not to be an evangelist for mlt

5401927 pilates is actually one of the safest forms of exercise causing less stress on joints and muscles than aerobic activity such as jogging
5401928 it is an activity i recommend to my clients as it can help with specific injuries and is a great de stresser
5401929 the pilates instructors will work with our osteopaths meaning the instructors can isolate particular problem areas and focus individual sessions on those specific muscles or muscle groups needing particular attention

5401939 what didnt surprise us was that total soft drink use was linked to overweight and obesity
5401940 what was surprising was when we looked at people only drinking diet soft drinks their risk of obesity was even higher
5401941 there was a 41 increase in risk of being overweight for every can or bottle of diet soft drink a person consumes each day
5401942 one possible part of the explanation is that people who see they are beginning to gain weight may be more likely to switch from regular to diet soda
5401943 but despite their switching their weight may continue to grow for other reasons so diet soft drink use is a marker for overweight and obesity
5401944 you have to look at whats on your plate not just whats in your glass
5401945 a lot of people say i am drinking a diet soft drink because that is better for me but soft drinks by themselves are not the root of americas obesity problem
5401946 you cant go into a fast food restaurant and say oh its ok because i had diet soda if you dont do anything else but switch to a diet soft drink you are not going to lose weight
5401947 if you offer your body something that tastes like a lot of calories but it isnt there your body is alerted to the possibility that there is something there and it will search for the calories promised but not delivered
5401948 people think they can just fool the body but maybe the body isnt fooled
5401949 if you are not giving your body those calories you promised it maybe your body will retaliate by wanting more calories some soft drink studies do suggest that diet drinks stimulate appetite
5401950 oh that this week im really concentrating on managing my altitude better next week ill work on airspeed

5401953 ive never really given people a chance to question my abilities
5401954 i just kind of jump in its a survival mechanism i learned a long time ago my parents instilled in me that i could do anything i put my mind to and not to let anyone tell me i cant do something i had people around me friends and faculty who gave me a chance and believed in me
5401955 it will be great break from writing papers all day
5401956 i want to do international law so i think this will be a great hands on experience
5401957 theres a small niche of international law called adoption law there are not enough people in the field who basically help parents who want to adopt international adoption is a really crazy process because countries have to have laws that match up
5401958 we were able to take and apply our coursework to the community and see an impact and have an academic base as well
5401959 we felt one of the biggest problems with these kids is that they had people who would come in and out of their lives we didnt want to perpetuate that by doing the exact same thing to them
5401960 im so glad that i got involved in so many different areas on campus
5401961 i admired palmers intense focus in class she believed the class material was important but that great effort would be required to do well and indeed for 15 weeks her focus never wavered she received one of the highest marks in my class completing it with considerable distinction
5401962 she is certainly one of my students that i will remember for educators like me we are thankful for the opportunity to teach and learn from blessings like palmer

5401972 open source software originated in the grassroots developer community and it is most successful when that community is strong we see the irish open source technology conference as a key opportunity for users and developers to come together to share opinions ideas and experiences and to build professional relationships that will sustain the industry in the future we are therefore delighted that have decided to include an open source event as part of their ixtc series of conferences
5401973 it is widely recognised by economists nowadays that strong business networks are the key to competitiveness irishdev com plays a vital role in networking irelands software sector their history of delivering successful events gives us confidence that the iotc will be an important milestone in the growth of open source in ireland indeed the range of speakers and topics suggest that it is shaping up to be an exceptional event

5401985 expected the same out of me in the classroom as on the court
5401986 statistics was hard for me so howard and i got real close
5401987 what impressed me most about him was that after he did poorly on the first exam he came to me and said that his performance was not up to his standards that he was going to do better and that he needed me to tell him how he should go about doing better
5401988 he was always looking for ways to reach out to others
5401989 i found him to be a very compassionate and caring student
5401990 he cares really deeply and is engaged in his reading and his work in his mentoring work as well he was a great example for younger people i like to think of what shans doing not just as community involvement but as community engagement he is someone who can make a difference
5401991 he is one of the nicest most genuine people i know i am very proud of him and what he has done to make vanderbilt a better place

5402013 i left at four in the morning and got here after four hours i have brought 10kg of opium from my fields to sell
5402014 if we had roads clinics factories and if there were job opportunities i would not do what i am doing now
5402015 they are so strong that we sometimes find ourselves outnumbered fighting them
5402016 in these mountains of achin district and other border villages they have everything from heavy machine guns rocket propelled grenades and of course better vehicles and more money than we do
5402017 they should target the ones who are selling the heroin to western countries i sell my opium to feed my family and from my heroin they can even make medicine when i have water and roads provided to me i will stop growing poppies
5402018 i dont want my children to be in this trade and i hope that some day the world will help us only then can we stop the opium trade

5402020 that is what we swore we would do you cannot change your mind now
5402021 if the wind changes your lips will remain like that
5402022 i know you dont feel like one of my stories today but i believe the little one can do with some storytelling remember how i would tell you a story each night
5402023 then let me tell you this one and then you will feel better i promise you
5402024 unfortunately this is a true story one that happened in my generation so a long time ago in my village there was a decree that the female child was of no use in the structure of the family the male child on the other hand could chop the wood tend to the animals and do all chores so when famine became our unwelcome guest the men of the village decided that all female children born would be put to death within 12 hours of their birth
5402025 remember my grand daughter we had famine at the time the men of our family believed they were doing the right thing
5402026 so allow me to continue it became the normal practice for a good twenty years and then the villagers reaped what they had sown the young men of the village desired a wife they believed they were strong to till the soil and smart to look after an entire farm they prided themselves on being the sons of their fathers but unlike their fathers they had no brides the young men of my village traveled to all villages to find wives but the reputation of the village preceded them and no one would allow their daughters to marry into such ignorance eventually no matter how far they traveled they would always return dejected and alone
5402027 oh nanna what a tale you weave if it was all true and it was your village why are you here
5402028 my father and mother dressed me as a male child and when i was four years old we all traveled to another village
5402029 my mother and father were very wise and have always believed that in life no matter what others do or say we have a choice they chose me
5402030 we make it easier because there are so many forms of support and help for people to use we have done all the exhaustive research and complied everything in one place to make it simple and easy to find plus it is free so you cant beat that
5402031 im so sorry to bother you yesterday you were here talking to a man and you took the train into the city together

5402035 i missed my train home to the country see i only work in the city until friday and then i travel home and he was ever so nice even sat with me a while
5402036 he even introduced me to his work colleagues and asked them to find a way that i could get home
5402037 the heat was rising up maryannes legs hotter as this young womans voice became more excitable and higher pitched
5402038 he was really really nice and i just wanted to see him again and say thank you

5402059 the escaping of refugees and the fear in peoples eyes in the movie took me back to a journey that i once experienced myself
5402060 its a movie that describes a day of a child soldier in a battlefield i would love to add the moments before a child soldier goes to war and how they feel when they lose a battle and a couple of their friends the real battle is not when you are fighting its when you have left the war and you have to deal with the nightmares and the boredom
5402061 we really sensed the governments support its desire to welcome us its need to give testimony
5402062 for liberians it was a way to assess before the international community that they had moved on that they had turned the page after 15 years of war
5402063 it was primordial for me to work with ex child soldiers who seemed to be the only ones capable of giving a sincere testimony of this horror
5402064 with the aim of bringing framework and support to the young actors of the johnny mad dog movie
5402065 it was unimaginable for me to reproduce the scheme the children had known during the war the general comes takes the children and abandons them as soon as its over i wanted to continue following the childrens progress trying to help them in their reinsertion into society
5402066 it is a place where they know they can turn to to eat attend courses sleep and be listened to
5402067 i hope this film will be an opportunity to address the problem of child soldiers in the world which unfortunately is still a topical issue and remains nonetheless unacceptable and intolerable
5402068 i kan kunne komme ind p vores marked hvis i opfylder det her krav
5402069 my wife and children are left there even though i asked the authorities to let us go together
5402070 i didnt even have time to get my wages from my employer now that they deported me who will look after my children if someone throws them on the street who will give them shelter this is cruelty
5402071 we are muslims and they are muslims as well so why have they done this to us we dont have any one to look after us
5402072 also there are the human rights concerns that we have seen at the border like separated families some cases of maltreatment
5402073 the process definitely needs to be sorted out in a more humane manner
5402074 we are determined once and for all to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants in iran and this doesnt mean only afghans but any other nationalities who have illegal immigrants here
5402075 the money we were supposed to spend on reconstruction for our own country has been spent on refugees today when we count the cost it is 7bn a year or 6 per afghan every day

5402079 black cool has been pursued but never captured imitated but never really quite understood over the past threee months and nearly a dozen meetings and discussions the dietors of ebony sought to identify the 25 coolest black men of our time we scoured the archives polled the staff and identified more than 80 names of brothers who we thought in their prime might qualify we lobbied and we aregued we even fought over the very definition of cool is it how they look the walk the confidence in the end we decided that there is no single definition of cool it is indeed in the eye of the beholder

5402090 we all know which foods children need to grow and be healthy so how is it leaders are satisfied with the double standard of sending food that they wouldnt dream of giving their own kids
5402091 without concrete significant long term commitments we are fooling ourselves to think that we will have a significant impact on treatment and prevention of child malnutrition

5402111 japan has listened intently to the concerns surrounding their hunt and the special significance whales have in many cultures
5402112 this move can be seen as a bold step forward in breaking the impasse over whaling that has burdened the iwc for many years
5402113 japan has shown that it is serious about working to preserve the iwc
5402114 i commend bill for his determined leadership on this issue and his years of service on the international whaling commission his efforts along with those of the japanese vice chairman will reduce tensions among commission members and shape how negotiations within the iwc are conducted in the future

5402141 we are trying to have crime documents to work in a better way everything will be better step by step

5402198 our study suggests young women are moving away from weight loss groups and classes with 58 preferring to receive individual face to face advice on weight loss from a health professional they want information on a range of topics including meal planning cooking low fat recipes and how to better manage stress
5402199 this request for information also suggests they dont currently have access to good quality information about healthy eating and being physically active or that the abundance of information that is currently available simple serves to confuse them they would also be more likely to participate in a weight loss program if it was tailored to their needs
5402200 many of the women who come to me for weight loss advice are on the dieting merry go round and have tried lots of different weight loss programs that havent worked the key to success is giving people the information they want and the confidence to eat in a way that is right for them apds work out an eating plan that meets each persons specific needs and fits with their lifestyle so they can stick with it for life

5402230 it was frustrating and it gets to you after a while but youve got to stick with it
5402231 coach told me the monday before the albion game that i was going to start

5402233 he such a great athlete so im glad hes been able to play receiver and hes real good out there too
5402234 you never want to see something like this ruin a friendship and i think matt getting work in at receiver and playing well has helped develop that relationship again

5402244 we are making the same pledge for our 2007 annual report this is another way to reinforce our commitment to environmental and sustainability leadership
5402245 this partnership creates a double win for those who care about sustaining the earths resources
5402246 the 80 000 shareholders directly helped save trees energy and water by forgoing printed materials and the donation from duke energy will have a meaningful impact on the conservancys ability to protect plants animals and natural communities for future generations to use and enjoy

5402272 t oday pacifism is a more realistic and necessary approach to world affairs than ever before
5402273 in general if we look at something as a challenge rather than a threat we can feel more self confident about our ability to deal with it effectively
5402274 it helps too to recognise that this situation of feeling our persons and out communities are insecure is not one that is faced by american alone
5402275 gave the commanders of u s forces in iraq and afghanistan broad permission to destroy people and infrastructures that may or may not have constituted valid military targets
5402276 entrenched and beyond the reach of the law as al qaeda did in afghanistan in the 1990s and as many terror groups did in iraq after the u s led invasion in 2003
5402277 today all of humanity is threatened by the consequences of global warming
5402278 we u s citizens and our leaders need to make the simple but profound mindset shift of seeing ourselves as truly and equally a part of global humanity rather than as somehow standing aside from or above the rest of the worlds peoples
5402279 we have a good basis on which to start building a foreign policy grounded more in a sense of hope and possibility than in a continuation of fear

5402284 were very pleased to have the dublin java user group on board for the irish open source technology conference we worked with
5402285 it was pretty clear from the irish java technology conference last year that open source has become a major force in many of the key areas that affect us as software developers on a day to day basis but of course a java conference could only address a fraction what is on offer in the open source world
5402286 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5402287 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5402288 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5402301 the chemical compounds detected in the surface soils of the neighboring property immediately west of the site are primarily hydrocarbons which are widespread in urban environments because they are found wherever combustion processes such as burning wood coal gasoline and charcoal have occurred
5402302 our experts have told us the levels of chemical compounds on this property would need to be much higher to pose an immediate health risk
5402303 we expect the studies to be a lengthy and complex process and unfortunately any remediation effort could be a significant inconvenience for these homeowners so weve offered to purchase the properties
5402304 certainly any purchase decision is up to the individual homeowners and if they wish to stay in their homes we will do our best to accommodate their preferences and minimize the disruption caused by our work
5402305 the main complexity obama has to confront in iraq is the apparent success of the most recent phase of u s military strategy of which the troop surge was a key part violence has come down from stratospheric heights the success is relative violence is still at 2005 levels but the situation is far better than obama predicted when he voted against the surge in january 2007 he claimed on more than one occasion that it would lead to increased casualties and sectarian violence it didnt howd he get that one wrong in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed but they have made hard choices prime minister nouri al maliki launched incursions into basra and confronted cleric muqtada sadr both of which helped pave the way for the sunni factions return to the government this is not enough progress to suggest iraq is anywhere near stable but like the drop in violence its more than obama predicted

5402322 first place in april is akin to winning the iowa caucuses hello gov huckabee
5402323 hes got a great attitude and saying he has no problem with it
5402324 i think it will be good for him to get those at bats
5402325 they wore me out pretty good but it was fun its part of the competition of the game
5402326 if you really want to be successful in business you must go out and get it for yourself it wont show up on your door step success requires work and effort hard work and dedication pays off
5402327 success is built from the inside out there is a golden nugget buried in your soul that you get to unlock if you choose to
5402328 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5402329 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5402330 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5402331 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5402332 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5402333 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5402334 sure you can itll be fun and nobody has to know
5402335 i know its usually 45 and well worth it but the crew and i have been here for fourteen long days we came from colorado to fight that fire without us this town might not be here without us the entire state of idaho might have gone up in smoke i think you can do it for 25
5402336 sure you can itll be fun and nobody has to know
5402337 mister if you can say it in three words or less ill do it for 100
5402338 the problem of law enforcement being the gatekeeper under the current system if victims dont want to deal with law enforcement and change their mind tomorrow weve lost evidence
5402339 when a victim comes to the hospital they are traumatized
5402340 they just want to go home and go to bed they dont want to deal with police the long length and wait
5402341 but then they go home and wake up the next day theyve showered eaten used the bathroom and smoked and basically ruined all of the evidence and they change their mind and theres nothing we can do for them
5402342 the ability to interview people at the scene to find people who may have seen or heard something is compromised
5402343 the story has to meet the elements of a crime some of them decide to go home
5402344 i want them all to report and we try that first
5402345 we talk to them about who would be responding to the hospital we tell them a little bit about what we know about the police process
5402346 if they say no no no then we tell them about jane doe they dont all take that either some of them just dont want to reflect backward they dont want to think about it
5402347 please do not open destroy or send to the maryland state police crime lab a forensic nurse examiner from the western maryland health system will notify you of the date to destroy if the victim has not reported within the time period
5402348 a lot of victims come forward relatively late in the game and sexual predators often have multiple victims before theyre caught keeping more physical evidence around longer is obviously helpful when we want to prosecute someone for multiple sex crimes
5402349 this sounds crazy but i didnt truly know what happened until about a week later
5402350 it was election day i know because we were off of school i woke up and i was just like oh my gosh i said no i said no and he didnt listen and i tried pushing him away
5402351 i ran down to my sister and told her that and she was like well em thats rape thats serious i was shocked i was 14 i couldnt grasp it all
5402352 i hear from a lot of other survivors who feel that when they talk to the cops theyre being victimized all over again
5402353 thats the sad part but a jane doe program would give people time to secure evidence and get their thoughts together as much as they can
5402354 at the same time somebody did something bad to you they need to be put away i dont think a lot of time should be given because if they waste time then that person could be right back on the streets or in somebody elses house doing the same thing or worse end up killing the person

5402404 at that time i was sleeping in my bedroom my school were in chongqing at first i thought i were having a dream but after a short time i realized it was an earthquake it was much noise outside all the people flooded from the building i just took a trousers with bare foot and jump out of my bed everyone was nervous and anxiety it looks like the end day of the world after a few minutes people remembered calling the friends or families how they were but they found the cell phone cannt be used after a long time may be half an hour the communication was recovered you can see nearly every one were calling some were afraid the other were exciting for it was his first time an hour later people came down but a few stay outside still how terrible the noon is

5402410 the hospital at that time 100 years ago or 50 years ago was a very different place than it is today sleep really wasnt an issue because the intensive care units didnt exist the labs were closed at night they did not have the volume or the acuity of patients as they do today
5402411 there is no other industry in the united states or anywhere else in the world where 100 000 people are being scheduled to work 30 consecutive hours twice a week and those are the limits that are not even being honored today
5402412 there is a disincentive for both the residents and the programs themselves to report violations to the acgme if a program were to report that they were in violation they would be at risk of being shut down

5402425 and that by disallowing unlocking to use a european providers sim with more reasonable rates

5402447 forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciliation with the person that hurt you or condoning of their action what you are after is to find peace remember that a life well lived is your best revenge instead of focusing on your wounded feelings and thereby giving the person who caused you pain power over you learn to look for the love beauty and kindness around you forgiveness is about personal power

5402704 the lord cast a glance at the dwellers of the earth and felt highly displeased with them whether arabs or non arabs
5402705 it is not poverty that i fear for you but what i really fear is that the earth should be spread for you as it had spread for those who came before you so that you could covet it as they had coveted and then it destroyed you as it had destroyed them
5402706 spend your wealth for the cause of allah and be not cast by your own hands to fitting destruction and do good as it ought to be and carry it on lo allah loveth those who do good deeds
5402707 chinas great leap the beijing games and olympian human rights challenges
5402708 the year 2008 is also the 30th anniversary of deng xiaopings reforms and opening policy which transformed the country by allowing economic freedoms but not allowing political freedom or basically human rights
5402709 so you could say that the next leap forward for china needs to be in the area of press freedom the rule of law and basic human rights
5402710 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
5402711 indigo is lubrication for software it reduces friction between the moving parts

5402713 this revised research plan represents an update to the 2003 strategic plan of the u s climate change science program as with any strategic plan we must take into consideration advances in science and changes in societal needs and i encourage the public to participate by providing comments over the next 60 days
5402714 most of them were written by matt wallace but at least two of them were written by anne stringer
5402715 theyre not written or presented as complete self contained stories
5402716 apparently from what it said at the beginning it consists of a series of complete in themselves from what i can tell monologues that are also part of a larger story
5402717 maze of injustice the failure to protect indigenous women from sexual violence in the usa
5402718 american indian and alaska native women experience sexual violence at 2 times the rate of all other women in the united states
5402719 the statistics are so horrendous and so shocking that cerd the u n committee wants to hear about it
5402720 this is just based on crimes that have been reported
5402721 in order to achieve justice survivors of sexual violence frequently have to navigate a maze of tribal state and federal law in some cases this has created areas of effective lawlessness which encourages violence
5402722 its an issue that is a concern for all reservations in montana and the fact that tribes do not have jurisdiction over non indian perpetrators against native women
5402723 women often form the backbone of indian communities the fact that this violence against women is at such high levels its an issue for all tribes
5402724 when that many women are suffering that type of violence
5402725 its almost a basic requirement one of the first things a government needs to do is to protect its citizens its such a basic human right the right to be safe in your own body rape is the ultimate violation of that its just hard to fathom its happening across the united states
5402726 the u s isnt denying it its their statistics theyre aware of it having title ix and having congressional hearings doesnt mean a lot until they do something
5402727 a policy statement without any way to back it up doesnt do a lot
5402728 isnt a consultant really the better trainer then someone hired as a full time trainer
5402729 isnt a consultant really the better trainer then someone hired as a full time trainer
5402730 some of the most vulnerable seabird populations travel entire oceans in search of food seabird conservation will require nations with longline fishing fleets to work together to adapt their fishing practices to avoid seabirds wherever they fish
5402731 the fate of these vulnerable seabirds is important to the united states and to our longline fishermen who under u s law are already taking significant precautions to avoid seabird bycatch
5402732 we are pleased that some of the same effective measures will now be adopted by fishermen from many other nations
5402733 a powerful step toward the re introduction of the process of demeaning jews you cannot respect another religion if you teach that those who are part of it must convert to your own religion
5402734 the design process we went through was rigorous and interesting so we thought we would share more of it here we tried in total more than 300 permutations it was much harder than we thought at first
5402735 we were really disappointed in our defensive intensity last week
5402736 we unfortunately gave up two touchdowns in the air that we usually dont give up that happens though when you are not tuned in mentally and emotionally
5402737 our kids will be focused and come to play tonight
5402738 we still are confident in what we bring to the table each week if we go out and win this week last week will be forgotten
5402739 we will have to continue to pound the ball more and nickel and dime them in the running game with our two backs
5402740 we just dont act like it is a big deal to go on the road and we try to be as prepared as possible
5402741 a couple years ago i had the idea that we should have a kid report on the chicago candy expo
5402742 i was thinking of my own kid but when that didnt work i went to baileys school and asked her to help me out for the day
5402743 i hadnt processed how big the today show actually was
5402744 but as soon as i got to new york and saw the full size of the show i realized how lucky i was to get this experience
5402745 she doesnt act like a kid or take herself too seriously shes so poised even if shes nervous it never shows
5402746 i do jumping jacks run in circles and sing annoyingly loud
5402747 everyone thought i was the correspondent and asked if bailey was my daughter waiting for an autograph
5402748 it was really cool to be asked to interview miley and it was really interesting because of how big she is
5402749 she was a really normal person really nice and very mature
5402750 someone came up to me at an indoor pool and asked if i was on the today show
5402751 other than that and a few other people i dont really get recognized and nothing has changed
5402752 its about changing the rules of medical innovation coming up with new proposals that ensure the drugs we need are developed and are made affordable but with so many vested interests involved will governments be bold enough to take that step
5402753 we wont give up treating people with the tb drugs that we have right now but to really get tb under control we desperately need new drugs
5402754 i hope that governments find ways to mobilise the level of research it will take to come up with effective new treatments if not the future for a disease like tb looks pretty bleak
5402755 the r amp d system status quo means that doctors working in developing countries are stuck using old and failing treatments and tools for diseases like tuberculosis
5402756 there are some big ideas on the table that could help produce urgently needed medical products for developing country diseases what we really need now is the deep commitment of governments relying exclusively on philanthropic organisations and charities is not a so lution

5402758 hey sweetie im raven riley and im guessing youve probably heard or seen me before but even if you havent i want you to get to know me very well so well that ive had my very own raven riley fleshlight created just for you i really cant wait to have you try me out and if you cant stand it any longer either order my fleshlight today you wont regret it
5402759 since theyre permanent i dont want anything spur of the moment
5402760 i wouldnt put anything on me that i wouldnt be proud to wear when im 60
5402761 if its made people more aware and more interested in conservation and the protection of the environment were very pleased
5402762 it was more of less the center of that music art publishing hairdressing world
5402763 it was a very exciting time to be in london
5402764 in those days everybody in australia went to england as soon as they got out of university
5402765 if you asked for a blue one they said get lost
5402766 without batting an eye the manager said would that be one hump or two maam i had to see the department store that was so cool
5402767 i was pretty shocked to see this animal even if it was three months old in this tiny cage this isnt right we really have to do something about this and right there we decided to buy him
5402768 we persuaded the owners of the shop that it would be great publicity for the shop if we had the lion live there
5402769 he knew that we wanted him to calm down not now lets go that sort of thing we were very fortunate that we got it right we ended up with a wonderful animal he never bit anybody
5402770 he had the whole of the basement he had these toys down there rolled up old mattresses
5402771 he had his own kingdom downstairs thats where he slept
5402772 its a lovely story and were delighted people are interested in it
5402773 if they want to support the george adamson trust were delighted
5402774 because i got the blackberry from forbes for free and i couldnt see buying an iphone and carrying both of them and um in case you hadnt noticed im not actually steve jobs you dumb fuck
5402775 as you slash irontooth his eyes fill with rage and he lets out an ungodly roar charging at you with mindless savage fury you can tell hes no longer thinking clearly but the renewed strength of his blows seems more important at the moment
5402776 they cast from the wizard list and get these additional bennies

5402781 most brothers didnt know that you know i used to see dogs fighting in the neighborhood all the time i didnt know that was fed time so mike probably just didnt read his handbook on what not to do as a black star
5402782 i think you know we dont say anything about people who shoot deer or shoot other animals you know from what i hear dog fighting is a sport its just behind closed doors

5402787 i took two bullets for this country and look what im doing
5402788 really from the bottom of my heart i want to thank you
5402789 if we had lost that particular war our whole way of life would have been shot
5402790 the ww ii soldiers are now dying at the rate of about 2 000 every day i thought we needed to thank them
5402791 so where does this leave us well as one church of england priest said this week i think that christianity my tradition needs to get over its obsession with respectability if we want to talk about theology and sexual orientation we should stop defining people exclusively in terms of their sexuality we should really listen to the stories of people whose lives are the subject of the current theological debates and we should spend at least as much time actively speaking out against homophobic attacks and replacing homophobic language with words and actions that respect peoples dignity we need to recognize that the history of religious and political institutions alike includes changing their positions on a range of important issues from slavery to race to gender and maybe ultimately we need to take the risk of believing that a faith defined by the notion that gods love is never exhausted the archbishops own words might actually have something new to say to us about human relationships
5402792 the wine has a very alluring aroma reminiscent of fresh sierra meadow flowers with a hint of peach and honeysuckle
5402793 for many of the people on that plane that may well have been the last thing they saw
5402794 when i think of skyline drive i think of those drag lines
5402795 you wish you didnt have to do it but this was a celebration of the process
5402796 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5402797 never before have so many people who cant afford enough to eat been so overweight
5402798 half of one percent said that they often didnt have enough to eat due to lack of funds
5402799 if poverty means lacking nutritious food adequate warm housing and clothing for a family relatively few of the 35 million people identified as being in poverty by the census bureau could be characterized as poor
5402800 while material hardship does exist in the united states it is quite restricted in scope and severity
5402801 the average poor person as defined by the government has a living standard far higher than the public imagines
5402802 i think its okay to give a little money or food to people on the street
5402803 and another problem is that its hard for people to rent if they have a criminal record or no bad credit so they may end up in run down motels that cost an arm and a leg
5402804 perhaps your understanding of poverty is not complete perhaps not being able to pay your heat bill in december in michigan constitutes poverty perhaps having to choose between food or perscription drugs constitutes poverty
5402805 perhaps we need to recognize that our worldview isnt complete no matter how good our theology may be
5402806 but i cant do it alone i need you we need you we need you to rediscover wonder and awe we need you to believe that it is really possible we need you to join us its better that way its what jesus had in mind
5402807 we found that people who walked for an extra 45 minutes a day became better at burning fat over a period of weeks this helped control their blood glucose levels
5402808 people often find the thought of going to the gym quite daunting but what weve found is that nearly everyone with diabetes is able to become more active through walking in our study many people got off the bus a few stops earlier and some took a walk at lunchtime
5402809 what is exciting about this study is that it provides an immediate way to help control diabetes without any additional drugs by building physical activity into everyday life the difficulty of making time to go out just for exercise is avoided it is an important and simple health message walking 45 minutes extra a day helps diabetes
5402810 we were able to show that people with type 2 diabetes did not have any basic problems with the mitochondria but by becoming more active it actually helped the mitochondria to become more efficient
5402811 even in this limited eight week period we could see that people with type 2 diabetes were processing energy more efficiently which meant that walking for 45 minutes more is an effective way to help improve glucose control
5402812 dr trenells findings prove that even gentle physical activity is vital in managing type 2 diabetes effectively controlling the condition reduces the risk of developing serious long term complications and will improve well being it is fantastic to see diabetes uk funded research translating into practical advice for people with diabetes

5402832 we see that when food prices rise the first thing to be reduced or cut out are things like milk products that young kids need most
5402833 this is why it is so urgent that donors not only provide enriched flours which are designed to meet the needs of adults but also help supply foods specifically designed for growing kids
5402834 unfortunately donors continue to apply a one size fits all approach to nutritional aid
5402835 the wrong food aid can mean children will still get malnourished and fall ill or die unnecessarily

5402841 it is not the role of this court to pronounce the second amendment extinct
5402842 for the first time in the history of our republic the u s supreme court affirmed that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms was and is an individual right as intended by our founding fathers
5402843 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

5402866 the supreme court is abusing and subverting its constitutional role it has chosen to become the unelected unassailable social engineer of american society
5402867 as a christian i understand that i might die or my children might die because i wont carry a gun but that is a price of my faith we have to stand up for breaking the cycle of violence even if it means dying
5402868 if a thief is found breaking in remember that every true israelite is a pacifist dont bother to defend yourself for that would be unworthy of a true jew sorry but thats just the price tag of your faith besides by succumbing to a thugs desire to murder you your non resistance will break the vicious cycle of violence
5402869 the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home
5402870 the handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement as applied to self defense violate the second amendment the districts total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of arms that americans overwhelmingly choose for the
5402871 i snicker and shake my head in disbelief that there are four justices on the supreme court that do not believe americans have individual rights
5402872 everybody knows that it is in these anti american anti constitutional gun free zones where innocent people are forced into unarmed helplessness and where the highest body count of innocents is stacked up by evil perpetrators celebrating the condition of helpless sheep to slaughter
5402873 that is a bizarre immoral condition and a direct result of the cult of feel good liberals who could care less about dead good people as they wring their hands worrying about the rights of the most evil amongst us
5402874 a cesspool of crime for years this ruling confirms the rights of good people the ability to defend themselves against bad people who could possibly find fault with that supreme dose of common sense
5402875 facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictums of our passions they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence

5402878 their new profile page essentially ignored the privacy setting to withhold the data of birth
5402879 for a brief period of time a small number of users were able to access a private beta of facebooks new site design meant only for developers during that time some of those users had their birthdays revealed due to a bug
5402880 it raises a more serious question which is can you trust these social networks to look after your data properly
5402881 this victory is a momentous occasion for rugby in cayman and without doubt the most impressive achievement in the unions history
5402882 many of these players have come through our youth development programme and worked hard for three years to get to this stage
5402883 just getting to the final was a huge step for the further development of rugby in both unions
5402884 encouraged and enthralled by the vast steps in progress made by this young mexican side in the last couple of years

5402980 as most of you know i am not a president bush fan nor have i ever been but this is not about bush it is about us as americans and it seems to hit the mark
5402981 a is it that we have electricity and running water 24 hours a day 7 days a week
5402982 b is our unhappiness the result of having air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter
5402983 c could it be that 95 4 percent of these unhappy folks have a job
5402984 d maybe it is the ability to walk into a grocery store at any time and see more food in moments than darfur has seen in the last year
5402985 e maybe it is the ability to drive our cars and trucks from the pacific ocean to the atlantic ocean without having to present identification papers as we move through each state
5402986 f or possibly the hundreds of clean and safe motels we would find along the way that can provide temporary shelter
5402987 g i guess having thousands of restaurants with varying cuisine from around the world is just not good enough either
5402988 h or could it be that when we wreck our car emergency workers show up and provide services to help all and even send a helicopter to take you to the hospital
5402989 i perhaps you are one of the 70 of americans who own a home
5402990 j you may be upset with knowing that in the unfortunate case of a fire a group of trained
5402991 k or if while at home watching one of your many flat screen tvs a burglar or prowler intrudes an officer equipped with a gun and a bullet proof vest will come to defend you and your family against attack or loss
5402992 l this all in the backdrop of a neighborhood free of bombs or militias raping and pillaging the residents neighborhoods where 90 of teenagers own cell phones and computers
5402993 m how about the complete religious social and political freedoms we enjoy that are the envy of everyone in the world
5402994 maybe that is what has 67 of you folks unhappy
5402995 fact is we are th e largest group of ungrateful spoiled brats the world has ever seen
5402996 did you hear how bad the president is on the news or talk show
5402997 the troops in iraq and afghanistan have volunteered to serve and in many cases may have died for your freedom
5402998 say what you want but i blame it on the media if it bleeds it leads and they specialize in bad news everybody will watch a car crash with blood and guts how many will watch kids selling lemonade at the corner the media knows this and media outlets are for profit corporations
5402999 they offer what sells and when criticized try to defend their actions by justifying them in one way or another just ask why they tried to allow a murderer like o j simpson to write a book about how he didnt kill his wife but if he did he would have done it this way insane

5403001 were delighted that this scheme has enabled so many couples to have a family from ivf treatment we find that couples coming forward are really considering what it means and whether its the right option for them their choice to take part in the egg sharing scheme means that important research is able to progress and we hope these successes will encourage other people to come forward
5403002 its not been easy but now we can finally look forward to a family of our own
5403003 we were devastated when it didnt work even though we had been prepared by staff at the clinic
5403004 we had already pushed ourselves financially and we knew we would have to wait and save before we could try again
5403005 even with this option we knew it would still mean re mortgaging our home but the egg sharing scheme offered us a chance because the treatment was half price
5403006 the team at the newcastle fertility clinic spent a long time explaining what egg sharing involved and answering all our questions we never felt pressurised into a decision in the end we felt this was the right way forward for us and were told we were suitable candidates for the scheme
5403007 there has been cancer in both of our families and the fact that this research could help people like us was a big part in helping us make our decision
5403008 the care we received has been excellent and now we just cant wait for the twins to arrive

5403057 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5403058 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5403059 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5403074 one important legal condition to be satisfied before the stb can grant an order for sale is that there is no objection filed by an owner on financial loss ground
5403075 another important legal ingredient is that of good faith in the act the good faith element has to be determined by having regard only to the following factors sale price the method of distribution of the sale proceeds and the relationship if any of the purchaser to any of the owners
5403076 would it be better to revert to the original position before the 1999 changes is the present regime manifestly superior to the pre 1999 position where 100 per cent consensus is required
5403077 unlike policies that are both initiated and driven by government agencies the en bloc legislation was largely a public private initiative the members sitting in the stb are all volunteers
5403078 given that nowadays most objections are not really about financial loss but about losing their homes there is a surprising dearth of the very people who should be involved in hearing these minority owners plight
5403079 provide additional safeguards and ensure greater transparency for all owners

5403083 understanding the sources of marine debris and the processes that distribute it throughout the sanctuary is crucial for designing debris prevention education and cleanup efforts to improve habitat quality
5403084 results from this new monitoring program will greatly enhance marine debris removal efforts in the sanctuary
5403085 we have a pretty good idea of what types of debris are out there where they come from and where the greatest concentration is
5403086 this new monitoring effort will help us determine how long individual debris items have been out there and how they affect seafloor organisms

5403111 something worth examining as we gear up to select a new leader this fall richard manipulates his friends the church and the public to get what he wants he will stop at nothing it will be interesting to see how much the audience is repelled by or attracted to him
5403112 performing shakespeare is a challenge and i want to embark on that challenge here in the county with the adults and kids ive worked with over the years people who know how much i love to teach and perform people who want to challenge themselves

5403150 we feel its an essential part of the organisation of the irish x technology conference series to take the pressure away from our line up of presenters by having fully kitted laptops ready on the podium from which they can just turn up and push in a usb device means all the hassle and pressure of setting up their own machine in a 15 minute window is taken away this is really important time when theyre mentally preparing for standing up in front of hundreds of developers to give their presentation
5403151 were extremely pleased to work with lenovo through the ibm brand they have a long standing track record in ireland and through initiatives like games fleadh championed by the phil bourke of the tipperary institute and who microsofts imagine cup theyre tirelessly working to support ict in second and third level education their values in this regard would not be disimilar from our own

5403162 great thread now come to my web site where hot midgets are personally anxious to make your naked acquaintance
5403163 it is truly unfortunate that i must come a third time to warn that you are about to make a terrible mistake in moving the chosen flight 93 memorial design to construction
5403164 theres islamic symbolism in the design the current design should be completely scrapped
5403165 please dont sanction a fully functioning mosque as the headstone on their graves
5403166 i was not prepared for the level of hate being spewed absolutely unnecessary absolutely unnecessary and very hurtful it generates hate and division where there should be none
5403167 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5403168 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5403169 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5403170 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5403171 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5403172 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again

5403175 a venture capitalist looks for a company that can be a significant size
5403176 we have been so impressed by the credentials plans and ingenuity exhibited by the finalists that we are arranging follow up meetings with representatives of our venture capital arm sap ventures for further evaluation of the plans
5403177 it was fun to try to beat the sats i looked at it as a challenge to accumulate as many points as i could
5403178 with the exception of expensive private tutors whats out there has always been a mass market approach
5403179 to establish a small revenue stream in this market is very possible
5403180 for a startup to move beyond a few million in annual revenues is going to be quite challenging
5403181 if the product brings measurable improvement in online play this would be good news to hard core gamers
5403182 one of those companies will probably acquire us instead of trying to make it on their own
5403183 i could get a pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less but to get toner i had to run across town or order online and wait for an expensive overnight shipment

5403206 se vai ter recess o importante que tenha logo de modo que reduza a press o sobre os pre os de commodities
5403207 the biggest error ive ever made had the best possible outcome
5403208 its happening were going into a great depression weve got to do something about it i want to start a foundation to help and id like you to be involved
5403209 robin hood is like the cool table in the high school cafeteria
5403210 these are serious accomplished dedicated people they demand your brainpower
5403211 theres a lot we can learn from that for the ge fund and the ge foundation
5403212 every community could have a robin hood like operation it wouldnt be as large or as well heeled as new yorks is because its like willie sutton said thats where the money is but when i talk to people in denver and memphis and other places and i tell them about robin hood their eyes light up
5403213 if i retired id love to teach second third or fourth grade i also like education because i think it has the greatest multiplicative powers in terms of the ultimate good youre going to do for the hours and dollars expended
5403214 fifteen years ago the only way you could impact inner city kids who didnt have proper educational services was through an after school program which is a very poor substitute for a great school day
5403215 that changed because the charter movement began and so my priorities shifted
5403216 charter schools are the best thing that ever happened to education in new york city because they provide competition to regular public schools and raise the bar that everyone is trying to attain they provide thought leadership for other schools so again theres a multiplicative impact
5403217 it is a rigorous and can be an exhaustive process
5403218 we set out to compare the relative return of any two grants no matter what their purpose much the way an investor compares the relative return of any two investments
5403219 for most of our grants our basic measure of success is how much does our grant boost early adult earnings of poor individuals
5403220 means that for every dollar robin hood contributes to the program collective earnings of the poor individuals served by the program rise by 5 as a ratio the benefit cost calculation can be used to compare the value of any two grants no matter their purpose
5403221 they size these agencies up in a gimlet eyed fashion
5403222 if you spend a dollar on something that doesnt work why continue this is about trying to solve poverty not applying band aids
5403223 measuring is appropriate as one instrument of understanding when you look at corporations you dont look only at their earnings you look at their product pipeline the quality of their management their labor relations things you cant measure precisely and its the same in the nonprofit world its important to understand to the extent that we can how effective our dollars are
5403224 dont lose that or we have to strip search the entire jail
5403225 if you can give these kids any bit of knowledge you are helping them
5403226 you never know what will trigger something good inside of them
5403227 if you are on wall street particularly in hedge funds you have to be here
5403228 the more you give the better you feel the better you feel the better youll trade
5403229 we are looking for a couple of 1 million bids for naming rights to the schools large facilities
5403230 gwyneth paltrow and i sat next to each other and cried at the last one together
5403231 because i adore and totally trust the people involved like harvey weinstein and universal music ceo doug morris
5403232 robin hood reaches street level thats all that matters to me
5403233 i was there to express rage at the terrorists and sympathy for those who died i still believe the message we sent the world at the concert was a realistic one we are vulnerable but we are also incredibly strong probably best not to f k with us like this too often
5403234 when we get in a board meeting everyone is a peer
5403235 the people from the media entertainment nonprofits and finance no one dominates the discussion
5403236 why put away money for a rainy day when its pouring out
5403237 these are people who could have incredibly high paying jobs anywhere and yet they chose to do this
5403238 and believe me the quality of employees here is the same as at a tudor or a goldman
5403239 why dont we throw in a couple of hits of acid too
5403240 but the needle exchange program also resonates with me because i think we did something very bold
5403241 i grew up in washington heights so i do feel a real affinity with the work that were doing
5403242 all my success was gained basically in new york city and this was my way of repaying new york i couldnt have done what i did anywhere else in the world
5403243 pauls genius was that he created an organization that didnt have his name on the door to make it easier for him to entice people to join robin hood not only for their money but also to contribute their time energy and brainpower
5403244 it wasnt about his ego it was about trying to do good
5403245 i think they keep tabs on how well we are doing
5403246 when we tell people their dollars are going to help their city that every cent goes to those in need that the board pays expenses and that we hold our grantees accountable you are talking about very powerful selling points
5403247 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5403248 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5403249 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5403250 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5403251 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5403252 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5403253 we would have liked to have closed that window completely that is one of the things we did not achieve in this contract and something we will be working on going forward the important thing is that we got jurisdiction in new media we got jurisdiction in the internet and we got a percentage of the distributors gross these were our major goals and we achieved those
5403254 i think that they will because theyll recognize the value of those programs being on beyond that window
5403255 its a tremendous start for us its a great way to begin the 21st century for people who are working in this business
5403256 we certainly heard from them and it was a heartbreaking thing for me as an animation writer those writers are more or less the sweatshop writers in this industry and our hope going forward is that we can improve that situation and get coverage from them
5403257 this will be a great priority for us organizing animation and reality
5403258 the key sticking point was the preservation of the future of the internet and the writers share in it your ceo peter chernin and the ceo of disney bob iger came into the picture along with les moonves of cbs behind the scenes to help us work out some of the details
5403259 i think the directors guild deal was achieved largely because we went on strike
5403260 this is an enviroment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here
5403261 i think jay leno should just fire his writers hes been at least as funny even more so since coming back on without them
5403262 well at least you got the poison in redondo right

5403266 about me well lets see i spend my saturday afternoons teaching latin to inner city african american children i started a non profit devoted exclusively to saving and rehabilitating three legged puppies the most important person in my life is my mother i was a finalist for the pulitzer prize in poetry in 2006 and wrote just about half of cat stevens catalogue i have perfect pitch and can play several instruments i like to cook go to church vote democrat and i can make women have multiple orgasms by staring at them counting to three and snapping my fingers
5403267 im sorry i wasnt really listening how many push ups can you do again did you say that already
5403268 oh i forgot one thing do you know god long story short i beat him in jeopardy about six years ago and now im immortal seriously i cant die subsequently last year he and i bet on the super bowl and i won again and now every time a woman gives me a blowjob he deposits 5000 in her bank account i cant believe i forgot about that he thought of that one
5403269 so is it like more or less than 50 push ups just give me a number here
5403270 no matter what happened i survived i endured and lived to tell about it and that counts for something probably very little but something

5403312 by hardcore love i dont mean the hardcore love you can find on the internet
5403313 i have no idea the real story and honestly its not of much interest to me whoever you are whatever journey youre on and wherever you end up i wish you wellness and happiness take good care
5403314 its a company that used to be severely slammed for its security procedures but following the 2002 trustworthy computing memo from
5403315 the problem starts with the developers themselves and in particular with their education
5403316 theyve normally majored in computer science and just havent had the grounding in security issues
5403317 great at fixing security problems or preventing those problems from happening in the first place
5403318 is that you and i enter a shop and think about what we could buy the security expert enters and thinks about what he could steal
5403319 i wish those 2 would get out of the way so we can see someone important
5403320 if you do not move out we shall rape the women
5403321 there are many women and children who have been molested and raped
5403322 many are yet to even speak out about their experiences as they struggle to survive
5403323 the attacks have been coming from everywhere including the camps themselves where security is lacking and the residents are desperate for basic needs like food and shelter
5403324 there is urgent need to protect the people in the camps or we shall be facing an even worse crisis because matters of safety in sexual crimes do not apply here
5403325 in a crisis like this your first thought is to care for your children and settle down you dont even think of reporting you are trying to figure out how to live
5403326 this is an emergency situation and this is not the time to think about these issues
5403327 we have encountered several cases especially at various camps in nairobi and its environs where some security personnel and humanitarian staff are said to have solicited sex in exchange for food and shelter
5403328 it has been difficult collecting statistics as sexual violence is so sensitive and stigmatised many are the victims who suffer in silence
5403329 the criminal justice system has also let the girls and women down because they are yet to take these matters seriously
5403330 thus the government and humanitarian organisations need to move with speed to address this added menace to kenyans already in distress
5403331 it is true that sexual violence existed long before the post election violence erupted
5403332 this crisis is therefore an opportunity to recognise the many gaps that have dogged women and girls and seeks to initiate lasting solutions
5403333 we need to involve the whole community we need to change a peoples attitude so as to be able to change the whole community
5403334 we need the government to think beyond the resettlements and focus on how the aggrieved idps who have probably lost everything are able to go back to the very same places very same areas where they were attacked
5403335 we need to lobby for the concerted efforts of all stakeholders to take this matter seriously
5403336 bottom line is the group effects peoples behavior and perceptions of themselves and reality
5403337 they were ages 13 19 and almost all members of gangs all committers of crimes and all survivors of an unimaginable variety of child abuse

5403345 you need to remove my resume as your sample immediately i have never sent my resume to you and am refuting your usage of it i wont hesitate to take legal action against you as i am able to prove without a doubt in a court of law that the sample resume youve posted is mine
5403346 on the submission form there was no mention about how the resume would be used nor did you restrict its use in fact im pretty sure you didnt read this particular submission form because it has never asked for business analyst resumes
5403347 your lawyer may find the above information useful or at least entertaining if your lawyer is like mine hell charge just as much whether hes laughing or doing actual work so good luck with that
5403348 lastly i will take some time to better anonymize the resume or replace it entirely with another one since you asked so nicely
5403349 if the attorney is a friend and finds your usage to be as offensive as i then im certain he wont have any problems filing papers in a ca court later well work out who exactly will have to pay for your poor judgment remove the format and all its contents now please
5403350 hmm yes an offended lawyer that is also a friend is indeed scary i need to start hanging out with a different crowd the resume that resembled yours has been removed

5403357 it would take at least a decade for oil companies to obtain permits procure equipment and do the exploration necessary to get the oil out of the ground most industry analysts say and even then they add the amount of new oil produced would probably be too small to significantly affect world oil prices
5403358 weve been in the same lectures for much of the time for the last five years me at the front and gemma at the back
5403359 we never set out to study together but rather fate intervened after i delayed starting the mbbs programme for a year and gemma was placed at durham to start the course in the whole of five years weve never worked together so now were graduating this could be the first time
5403360 ive wanted to be a doctor since i was a kid but i never dreamt it would be offered to me when the opportunity came i was 38 and there was a lot to consider as a mature student you really have to want to do it i was giving up a well paid job i had to juggle the family and theres still the mortgage to pay you have to be completely single minded about it
5403361 all the family have pitched in to help which has been wonderful my 12 year old daughter brought us cups of tea while we were revising together and i couldnt have done it without the support of my whole family especially this year with all the exams
5403362 its great to see this double celebration this is possibly the first time that a mother and daughter have graduated as medical doctors together the medical degree requires all students to demonstrate significant commitment to their studies for mature students graduating today like sharon the will to succeed often needs to be even greater we wish gemma and sharon every success in the future

5403365 the psp now has a very powerful security system but like the greeks we had people inside once a system is hacked and understood very little can be used to continue to protect it
5403366 you are all really smart but we need someone who is more than smart
5403367 considering all that ellie can do the reading her language acquisition etc have you seen other kids with similar issues like her
5403368 hurry up you missed it and im going to punch someone
5403369 the united states has become a world leader in conservation efforts for deep sea corals
5403370 deep sea corals are not only beautiful they are fragile living ecosystems that are critically important to the survival of many living creatures in our oceans this report is another tool that scientists and managers can use to help stop their destruction and to develop new ways of helping them recover and survive
5403371 this helps identify the location of deep coral habitats which in the long run helps scientists and managers better understand and conserve these unique resources
5403372 i think this represents a new day in the philadelphia police department and how we deal with these kinds of situations
5403373 virtual worlds are relatively inexpensive dont require a great deal of start up technology infrastructure and provide a naturalistic immersive approach to simulating space people and objects
5403374 just like social culture in the real world it evolves
5403375 encounter behavior that would not be acceptable inside ibm you should walk away or even sign out of the virtual world
5403376 growing up in los angeles i was acutely aware of smog and other pollution challenges of our community
5403377 im thrilled that in our own small way were helping to contribute to a cleaner safer environment
5403378 i was so excited when hybrid vehicles became readily available
5403379 after purchasing one for myself i began seeking ways to make our trucks more environmentally friendly from northstar movings inception we chose 100 recycled paper for our stationery and boxes our corporate color may be red but we are green on the inside were always looking for novel new ways to lessen our carbon footprint and make eco conscious decisions we love to hear from our clients with new ideas for further lessening our impact on the environment

5403395 superb expansion to the base game dow has resisted the temptation to toss even more chrome into the game and kept the expansion relatively lean that doesnt mean you dont get lots of new gameplay the changes actually do very much rework the game but you dont need to wade through another big rulebook and you dont need to re explain a bunch of things
5403396 i think this is too important an issue to tire of it
5403397 just because the number of victims has decreased dont feel that there arent more victims out there needing encouragement to come forward
5403398 its tempting but irresponsible to assume progress has been made at this very premature stage
5403399 there always has been and always will be a lag time in reporting abuse
5403400 if youre dope ill hear about you by someone other than you
5403401 quite hurtful to think we would want to create a memorial to those who murdered our loved ones
5403402 thats an absolute unequivocal fabrication that is being portrayed as fact
5403403 we felt confident with the notion that the void in the embrace was representative of loss
5403404 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5403405 ive got a lot of work and thats why i have so little time for myself
5403406 thus far user satisfaction ratings for vista have been weak and startup times for vista have been known to be much slower than the mac os x
5403407 thus more than 50 of recent customers buying macs in apple retail stores are first time buyers
5403408 hope apple doesnt do something to hurt itself like run out of shiny new iphones at 8 30am on friday
5403409 i tried a vista machine but the experience brought me to apple for a mac
5403410 freestyle skiing is a whole different ballgame now the way we skied then and the way theyre skiing now is completely different the whole mogul scene is different in the technique and how the sport has evolved
5403411 the sport is now more clinical and contrary to what it was in the beginning when freestyle skiing started you had all these challenging ski runs ruthies in aspen look ma in vail exhibition in sun valley and gunbarrel at heavenly valley they were famous for being tough challenging runs the idea was to hold a contest to see who was the best skier on the toughest run on a given day
5403412 it all started as a conversation between doug pfeiffer of skiing magazine and tom corcoran who just started waterville valley in new hampshire doug asked tom who the best skier on the mountain was tom answered the racers of course dougs reply was what about all those guys on the other side of the mountain skiing the bumps and getting air how about if we hold a contest and see whos best and so the first freestyle contest was born in march of 71 to find the best skier on the mountain and the rest is history
5403413 there were no boundaries and it was every skier pushing themselves to their limit to come up with stuff no one had ever done it was a very creative time
5403414 so while it appeared that was a wild free for all hurling yourself down the hill there was a lot of hard work that went into doing things on skis that had never been seen or done before the attitude we developed was that if were going to try these tricks that have never been seen before they had better work
5403415 freestyle skiing became synonymous with excitement back when it first started it wasnt as technical as it was exciting many times it was the skier who had the most exciting run or the most spectacular recovery that won the contest
5403416 the traditional spirit of freestyle can be seen in the x games which is closer to what it was in the 70s the spontaneity can be seen in free riding slopeside and big mountain skiing as well as skiercross and the halfpipe that you see at the x games
5403417 spontaneity was the key now its all so predictable and looks like what we tried not to be with racing then with ski racing everyone looked the same in the gates and now everyone looks the same in the moguls speed and air are the main emphasis and its turned into an aerial contest
5403418 i have to give a lot of credit to jonny moseley who broke the mold at the 02 olympics in salt lake city with his dinner roll the dinner roll was an off axis 720 that combines two full rotations one on a vertical plane the other a horizontal plane no one had ever seen it before and the judges didnt know what it was and didnt know how to judge it that was how it was in the early days of freestyle
5403419 the business now is manufactured and the skiing is fabricated back then it was all natural and everything was new we were limited pretty much to bumps and a steep run so we had to be creative in a different way as the sport evolved to be more disciplined it lost its free and became more stale
5403420 originally freestyle skiing was about who was the best all around skier in moguls ballet and air the big award and the car went to the skier who was the best all around now ballet no longer exists and there are only two events that are recognized at the olympic level moguls and aerials and those who compete are specialists for one event or the other most cant or dont do both so gone are the days of finding the best skier
5403421 its a shame because ballet is becoming a lost art and we really have an obligation to pass the knowledge on there is a whole generation that has grown up and never seen a skier do a royal christy or a crossover i would love the opportunity to train and teach the newer generation the art of the ballet trick skiing before i am too old

5403426 a diner might ask if a dish has meat but then order pasta with marinara thats made with a stick of butter thinking its healthy
5403427 i once heard a table congratulating themselves on not eating carbs but they had eaten fish in a sugary sauce
5403428 ask if the chef uses cheese butter or cream in a dish
5403429 if a sauce sounds creamy for instance choose something else
5403430 extra bread always and then ask for more lots of butter too
5403431 we dished out honey butter which was spiked with sugar
5403432 the cheesy biscuits were already swiped with melted butter so you got a double dose of fat
5403433 a lot of women save their calories when they know theyre going out to eat so theyre ravenous when they sit down
5403434 women do funny trade offs such as ordering a salad but having three or four margaritas
5403435 after that you get one more carb a starchy side such as roasted potatoes a slice of bread or another drink
5403436 at a table of 10 people seven will clean their plate along with bread appetizers and desserts at a dinner meeting theyll also order drinks
5403437 consider a meal on the boss a chance to have a nice piece of grilled fish you wouldnt make at home
5403438 save high calorie indulgences like desserts for times when youre with family and friends
5403439 there is no separation between church and state on a griddle which is routinely greased with oil veggie burgers are cooked on the same surface as beef burgers
5403440 nearly everything that goes on the grill is slathered in oil beforehand so the grill marks turn out better
5403441 scan the menu to find the healthiest veggie side dish
5403442 lets say youre ordering fish that comes with mashed potatoes ask to swap those for the grilled asparagus you see elsewhere on the menu
5403443 on dates women usually are a little shy about eating
5403444 women typically eat as much as their husbands or boyfriends do
5403445 we believe the revolution in information technology has just begun
5403446 believe it or not ive been so busy working on a special surprise for mgs4 buyers that not even those who have leaked copies of the game can spoil haha that i havent had time to catch up on most of the pre launch excitement
5403447 energy storage is key to the further development of renewables e on intends to double their share to almost a quarter of the energy mix by 2030 up to 2010 alone we will invest at least 6 billion in this area however to make better use of renewables we must also tackle the problem that they are not yet able to meet baseload demand for this we need innovative storage technologies
5403448 energy research provides for the future only innovative technologies will make sustainable energy supply possible security of supply economic viability climate and environmental compatibility are the keywords in this respect we must intensify our efforts in energy research and for this purpose pool the resources of industry and science even more
5403449 this long term commitment to promoting excellent research groups at universities and research institutes is exemplary
5403450 early dawning sunday morning its all the streets you crossed not so long ago watch out the worlds behind you theres always someone around you who will call its nothing at all
5403451 the senses were overloaded and overwhelmed on an opening night unlike any ever witnessed in these parts
5403452 im real proud for the city this is going to be great for washington
5403453 i t became vividly clear on sunday night that the washington nationals now have a home that is worth calling a home
5403454 was to major league ballparks what the bates motel was to quality lodging
5403455 when i use the word cathedral i only use it when the park deserves it
5403456 look nobody ever said that life is easy nobody ever said that some of these processes were ever easy you can look back in retrospect and say there were a lot of difficulties but here we are
5403457 we have enormous interest in cities wanting all star games theyre lined up for years to come
5403458 and as you know in opera there are tragedies theres redemption theres great happiness all of these things happen and of course that is also what could happen here in washington at this beautiful new yard from tragic circumstances losing streaks to redemption to an ultimate championship it will all play out here opera in the big ballpark along the anacostia
5403459 the clock started again for baseball in washington last night
5403460 washington finds itself with a franchise that has a fighting chance at a future thanks to a district paid ballpark that already has exceeded most expectations the nats have the financial foundation necessary to be competitive if a winning team is built far from a certainty the nationals boast a facility that can please fans gush cash and create credibility
5403461 take advantage of the multi core trend integrate more features into their devices while leveraging existing code isolate different functional system components and consolidate hardware
5403462 by consensus the stage two jury forwards this section of the flight 93 memorial to the partner paul murdoch with the full and unqualified support of each juror
5403463 no one agreed then with mr burnetts preferred choice for a final design
5403464 jurors gave all of mr burnetts concerns a complete airing
5403465 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism
5403466 team were able to make a gift to the fans who ahve always believed in them
5403467 i didnt understand what my teachers were saying and they didnt take the time to help me so i just used to skip school or cut class
5403468 when i came to kipp ways i wasnt used to everyone being on my back
5403469 i spent a lot of time getting to know our principal mr jernigan
5403470 in this generation if you dont have a college degree then you cant get the job that you want
5403471 i will not work in mcdonalds the rest of my life i see myself going to nyu clark atlanta or i want to say even harvard
5403472 where i used to go to school i didnt really care about anything
5403473 i dont really know where i want to go to college but i want to be an architect
5403474 the kids who come to our school tend to be at least one year below grade level when they get here
5403475 our philosophy is that its about rolling up our sleeves and working a lot harder
5403476 we spend a great deal of money on field trips for the kids
5403477 those are things that we feel are important because its part of exposing them to a world outside their community
5403478 there arent that many teachers who would be able to commit to being available at any hour for their students
5403479 but those are the types of teachers that we attract at kipp ways academy
5403480 in a traditional school that teacher would have stayed for at least a year at our school after three weeks we got rid of him found a new teacher and had a great year with great results for that class most school principals dont have those freedoms
5403481 we find out what motivates each child and then follow through with that consistently
5403482 i want to help them to understand that they are powerful people who have contributed to the world and i think that is what really pushes them
5403483 they cant play in the game they cant be part of the team
5403484 by virtue of the fact that they have chosen to come to our school the parents and students are choosing to commit to a higher standard
5403485 shell never forget her homework again we are that hard on students for a reason they wont be able to compete without it
5403486 mr jernigan will say do whatever it takes and sometimes we get really mad
5403487 but if i see him doing it too i have no choice i just say what do you need me to do because i see that it makes a difference
5403488 la piazza di rometta concepita dal grande maestro la cui scomparsa ci addolora molto appunto denominata
5403489 social tools for business use web 2 0 and the new participatory cultures
5403490 you are not an angel not the gift from saints i thought youd be you are like an ice king and youre picking holes in me
5403491 that womens taste for egalitarian harmonious connections is associated with the female hormone oestrogen
5403492 the ability to recognise emotions in the face is also linked to the female hormone oestrogen
5403493 if women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of our menstrual cycle when the female hormone is at its lowest level then why isnt it logical to say that in those few days women behave the most like the way men behave all month long
5403494 tr sor il y aura une cons quence ton action surtout ne pas dire punition
5403495 je cest semp trer quelque part entre piaget et rikson en passant par salom dolto et le courrier du coeur du journal du coin cest parfois se dire que se serait mieux de moins parler de ne pas justifier et pourtant de se remettre la faire la premi re occasion
5403496 we believe the revolution in information technology has just begun
5403497 it does continue to validate the concept of cloud computing
5403498 non possibile ricorrere alla somministrazione di lavoro per lesercizio di funzioni direttive e dirigenziali
5403499 should i use relational models or domain models to represent my data
5403500 should i use message models or domain models to represent my entities
5403501 early dawning sunday morning its all the streets you crossed not so long ago watch out the worlds behind you theres always someone around you who will call its nothing at all
5403502 one thing appears to be certain the nationals are not going to have a stagnant offense
5403503 it cant be dont you know who he is hes crazy john
5403504 i have learnt about the definition of true kindness from two people who tried for such a long time to revive john after he collapsed before the ambulance arrived they didnt know who john was and performed the ultimate act of kindness and i thank you both from the bottom of my heart
5403505 no other major it platform vendor has committed so much of its core assets to the open source software model as sun microsystems
5403506 the question is how fast can sun ramp up its newer technologies
5403507 they are also risky moves given that its strategy is a trailblazing effort with little precedent and few historical success stories to reference
5403508 we are going to be making some changes as a result of the quarter certainly but not in our core vision or strategic direction
5403509 the transformation the company is trying to make is certainly not easy
5403510 a lot of whether or not sun is going to be able to do better depends on how aggressive they are in restructuring and how well management can motivate the troops
5403511 when it comes to thermal compounds there used to be only one real choice arctic silver unless you were building oem type systems and selling them to others as was really the only viable choice for a quality high performance product over the past year however things have changed dramatically several new contenders have come to the front of the market place and shown that there are better solutions enter gelid solutions a company founded in 2008 whose goal is to design and manufacture thermal solutions though new to the business market the company is led by a pair of men with experience in the pc cooling industry and aiming their new and growing product line directly at the enthusiast gaming segment
5403512 the raidmax iceberg impressed us with its sturdy and quality construction we were definitely not expecting an aluminum case to be so strong but the thick aluminum of the iceberg makes it one of the strongest cases weve seen the design of the case also makes it one of the easiest to disassemble from the nice side panels to the easy to remove front panel cooling options provided were also very decent with four fans out of the case
5403513 it was not difficult to come up with a topic for our todays article because many readers demanded this very analysis comparison of top processors from intel and amd even though we state repeatedly that these products differ very much and their comparison makes little sense our readers still want to know the truth no matter how bitter it is well here you are
5403514 overclocking this board took a lot of trial and error but i finally managed to get it stable and good to go the cpu core voltage maxes out at 1 30v on this board so you are limited in how far you can push it also it did not like a multiplier greater than 14x after that the computer would not even boot i also had to put the hypertransport multiplier to 10x to have the link remain stable since i could not modify the memory settings which had a default 1 2 divider they had a mind of their own after all of the bumping and resetting of the cmos i finally got to 2 950ghz stable and no problems while running the benchmarks so with that the overclocked tests will be run at 2 950ghz on the phenom x4 9850

5403517 even though zerotherm doesnt have a long history of enthusiast products their quality has impressed me thus far the hurricane hc92 won an award in our mega 9 way vga cooler roundup back in april and their latest product the zen fz 120 proved to be a great performer with the added benefit of costing less than enthusiast cpu coolers today we will be looking at zerotherms flagship cooler the nirvana nv120 premium the nirvana has a small price premium over the zen around 10 dollars here in the states newegg currently lists the zen with a 10 dollar mail in rebate which negates the price difference it will be interesting to see if and how much better the premium cooler performs compared to the newer zen 120 that we reviewed last month
5403518 when it comes time for an enthusiast to upgrade his or her processor its usually quite a momentous occasion lots of planning goes into the perfect choice of hardware and its not uncommon for a cooler upgrade too as faster usually means hotter therefore they usually go for something something much beefier than before not one which looks similar to the stock intel model its odd saying that as today weve got a spire coolflow for review which does look remarkably similar to the stock intel heat sink and fan lets just hope it gives a boost in performance

5403521 when amd had unveiled the ati radeon hd 4850 and ati radeon hd 4870 last month nvidia was left in an awkward position the radeon hd 4850 had sharply outperformed the more expensive at the time geforce 9800gtx which led nvidia to immediately begin slashing prices and introducing a slightly faster geforce 9800gtx that ramped up the memory and core frequencies atis flagship radeon hd 4870 also had no problems competing with the more expensive geforce gtx 260 280 many of nvidias partners as a result have slashed their prices on their earlier geforce 8 and 9 products one of the nvidia products that was previously considered a good budget graphics card was the geforce 8800gt but now how does it stand up against the latest from ati and nvidia in this article we are looking at the ecs geforce 8800gt what is particularly special about this card and some of the other newer models shipping the geforce 8800gt gpu is a bios revision that should yield a performance increase
5403522 many small businesses and advanced home users will use some form of external storage device to backup data or store common files across a network one of the most convenient methods of doing this is to use a nas network attached storage device which allows you to access network shares from all other pcs connected to the same network the qnap ts 209 pro ii provides space for two sata hard drives providing ample storage capacity for example 2 x 1tb drives however this nas unit isnt quite as simple as just providing access to storage space it can do a whole lot more
5403523 today we are looking at a great free application for the iphone called labyrinth lite edition the lite version of the game has ten levels to play the controls for the game are the star of the show and work very well to control the ball you tilt the iphone in all directions the controls are simply fantastic and are so accurate that you can place the ball with ease on the screen the settings menu of the game has a spot for calibrating the game to the sensors in the iphone you set the iphone on a flat surface press calibrate and you are done

5403526 rather than get into a lengthy and scientific analysis on the thermal resistance of various substances im going to focus strictly on hard testing data what i hope to answer in this article is simple are there measurable performance differences between premium grade thermal pastes and if so how much
5403527 in an effort to market their products companies resort to naming schemes that offer a clue into that products particular identity this is no more realized than the newly redesigned thermaltake armor a full sized atx enclosure solution that is sure to make any enthusiasts eyes bleed with enough features and gadgetry to make even the most tech hardened nerd succumb to uncontrollable spasms the thermaltake armor sits at the forefront of chassis innovation or does it will the amor be able to withstand the fusillade that is the hardwarelogic review team or will the armor lay waste to all that opposes it like the medieval times of yore hl intends to go full tilt to find out
5403528 each and every video card is not going to overclock to the same level just as the same cpu will not always overclock to the same level for any number of reasons this holds true with the palit gtx 280 when overclocking a video card heat can become an issue in the same way that heat can impact your ability to overclock a cpu fortunately i was able to push this card slightly higher than the xfx model that i reviewed an increase of 126 mhz on the gpu core and 176 mhz on the memory are pretty stout overclocks these speeds represent an increase of almost 18 on the gpu core and almost 14 on the memory while not as over the top as the 9800gtx there is definitely significant head room to play with does this increase in gpu and memory clock speed equate to similar performance increases i think its time to find out
5403529 it carries a hefty 600 price tag but the ts 409 pro is a sound investment for a home or small business network for those who need much more than just file storage and backup this is the nas to get in addition to having a central location to store and back up files this product offers hard disk monitoring ftp web and smtp server functions user group management and one touch file copy from a usb disk and thats just scratching the surface everything is managed through a well organized web interface that can be accessed remotely via a secure ssl connection
5403530 when it comes to our computers wed love to always have the biggest and the best
5403531 it seems like nvidia graphics card releases run as clock work with the catalyst drivers from amd
5403532 if you find yourself getting sick to the stomach when you see how much cards like the gtx 280 and gtx 260 are and just cant understand why people would spend so much money on a graphics card the 9500 gt could be in your league the 9500 gt as you might have guessed comes in below the 9600 series and well below the 9800s its designed for people who are looking at getting away from onboard graphics but dont want to blow too much money you have to wonder with the new gtx 280 260 naming scheme as to why nvidia are still continuing to update the older 9000 series of cards either way we have a new low to mid range graphics card thats cheap and can hopefully offer low resolution gamers something that doesnt break the bank

5403538 whats interesting is that were seeing a top 20 very similar to the 2001 survey with dot coms and consumer goods placing very well
5403539 companies that used to be regarded as dot coms and were very volatile on the list are now established as major recruiters
5403540 there has always been 20 percent to 30 percent of people coming to the mba program with the hopes of changing their careers sometimes moving out of more traditional firms towards industries with a better work life balance
5403541 because students are looking for innovative companies with that balance theres been a big trend toward these less traditional employers
5403542 women have always been strong with consumer brands and in industries where there are marketing openings they look for industries that offer a better work life balance without crazy hours
5403543 this is an almost self inflicted salary gap because its what theyre expecting to get
5403544 it has increased from last year part of it is because women gravitate to the consumer goods industries that dont always have top salaries

5403552 we never started out with the idea of creating a commercial product
5403553 in the beginning we were simply looking at the use of video as a way to provide background knowledge and help kids create a model of text
5403554 in 1993 orange county schools were experiencing a huge dropout rate a very high truancy rate and behavioral problems
5403555 we discovered that virtually all of the kids had reading problems thats why the dropout rate and the truancy and the behavioral problems were high after implementing our program the students reading improved and the behavioral problems diminished
5403556 the model is laid out specifically for good reason if schools dont follow the model its not going to work
5403557 people think just because its a computer based program the teacher doesnt have to do anything thats not true
5403558 what were finding is that surprisingly there are a lot of kids who dont have the prerequisite skills
5403559 we need to examine what kind of support we can provide to make that regular curriculum a little more accessible to them
5403560 it might be as simple as providing text on a computer instead of in books so that if the students come to a word they dont know they can click on it and the word is read to them or they are given a definition

5403564 and in doing that work i became increasingly aware of math education and the possibility that some of my work could actually have an impact
5403565 people traditionally say look we know all these principles from cognitive science why dont teachers use them
5403566 but the principles are mostly based on lab studies with college students
5403567 prior research on comparison as a basic learning mechanism may be generalizable to a new domain mathematics a new age group school aged children and a new setting the classroom
5403568 but it is especially important to be flexible with them you need to recognize that they work in a variety of settings and comparison helps that process with comparison you get a broader range of when a procedure is going to work and are thus better able to adapt
5403569 most of the cognitive science literature on comparison is about transfer
5403570 if you learn in this context can you apply it to a new instance the hope is that if we can get students to compare we can help them notice whats important so that theyre able to transfer this awareness of deep structure to new problems

5403618 refiri ndose a la clase media fern ndez de kirchner indic que
5403619 tenemos que aprender a mirar mas all de lo que nos muestran tenemos que comenzar a mirar con nuestros propios intereses y dejar de lado los cantos de sirenas
5403620 aunque los pobres dejen de ser pobres nunca van a ser clase media
5403621 la presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner cuestion a la clase media urbana por entender que en ocasiones desconoce que surgi de un per odo de industrializaci n e inclusi n educativa de la historia argentina
5403622 la educaci n p blica y gratuita nos ha permitido tener buenos recursos humanos y una clase media que a veces se cree producto de s misma pero que es producto de un modelo que la ha creado como tal
5403623 cuando uno no tiene las necesidades materiales cubiertas es l gico que su preocupaci n mayor sea la de sobrevivir
5403624 todo discurso sobre clases sea acad mico de caf o de barricada es siempre un ejercicio de mala conciencia
5403625 muchas veces esa clase media surgida de la movilidad ascendente cree que ha logrado ese ascenso social solo por producto propio y no logra entender que ese ascenso es producto del esfuerzo de un modelo econ mico que la gener como tal
5403626 sus recursos humanos producto de la instrucci n p blica de la educaci n p blica y gratuita en nuestro pa s desde los niveles inferiores hasta los superiores que nos ha permitido junto a una movilidad social ascendente de gente que com a prote nas y entonces generaba neuronas recursos humanos una clase media argentina que mucha veces se cree solamente producto de su propio esfuerzo sin advertir que es el producto de un modelo econ mico que la ha generado como tal
5403627 la educaci n p blica y gratuita nos ha permitido tener buenos recursos humanos y una clase media que a veces se cree producto de s misma pero que es producto de un modelo que la ha creado como tal
5403628 y dale con pern a usted tampoco es muy recatado me parece siga defendiendo una resoluci n basura y mala pol tica econ mica

5403630 solo con mercados nunca falt ning n grano para el mercado interno la ltima vez que tuvimos que comer pan negro fue con los mercados intervenidos no digo que la intervenci n del estado sea siempre un mal en si mismo pero si estoy seguro que el mercado es mejor que una intervenci n manejada por una manada de burros corruptos e ineptos
5403631 es obvio que no es lo mismo la violencia de un grupo de ciudadanos que la violencia del estado y tambi n es obvio que la violencia de los militares no les sirvi s lo para vencer a la guerrilla lo habr an podido conseguir con mucho menos
5403632 supongo que es mejor que muchos para sentirse probos prefieran condenar a los militares antes que seguir apoy ndolos como entonces
5403633 i can categorically state on the record that is not the case
5403634 a gun in the hand is better than a cop on the phone
5403635 the whole counsel of god concerning all things necessary for his own glory mans salvation faith and life is either
5403636 all scripture is breathed out by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness
5403637 if a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies there shall be no bloodguilt for him
5403638 also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor you did not find them breaking in
5403639 and i looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people do not be afraid of them remember the lord who is great and awesome and
5403640 and all that generation also were gathered to their fathers and there arose another generation after them who did not know the lord or the work that he had done for israel
5403641 when new gods were chosen then war was in the gates was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in israel
5403642 but now let the one who has a moneybag take it and likewise a knapsack and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one matt j said
5403643 furthermore its ironic that jesus never uses his power to protect himself in fact he tells peter to put away the sword even when he will be unjustly tried and ultimately unjustly killed why did he not call down the wrath of the heavens
5403644 while an armed society doesnt necessarily lead to more deaths our own country has exponentially more handgun deaths each year than any other country in the world those deaths are not the result of people protecting themselves they are primarily the result of intentional murder and accidents
5403645 if we are to be people who live into the kingdom of god we may find it necessary to have arms yet we shouldnt be making biblical arguments that this is gods best way for his people to live
5403646 in d c hundreds of kids are killing one another each year period
5403647 here is what is disturbing our conservative justices were more concerned about being allowed the ability to have access to handguns than about kids being murdered on our streets
5403648 when we tout the second ammendment over the second commandment we show our alliegences its that simple
5403649 as for the rape case i believe this court finally made a good decision im not a liberal i simply think that you are in trouble when capital punishment moves toward rape and then what
5403650 yet we have no problem telling mighty exxon that raping gods earth for profit is entirely fine
5403651 the idea that guns can eradicate evil is as crazy as a war against terrorism
5403652 what if we spent time caring for our neighors rather than debating the merits of gun control
5403653 regardless i am pro life i am not only anti abortion i believe all of life needs to be protected we should protect unborn babies embryos old people good people bad people people who follow jesus and people who do not follow jesus
5403654 your theology supports your views of a conservative america as gods best plan for our planet i know you have not said such a thing but your theology rarely contradicts conservative america

5403656 the advanced nature of the disease also meant he didnt qualify for a transplant in ontario
5403657 fail to mention that most of the people who are going to the states for prompt care have their bills paid by their provincial health care plans
5403658 the 45 million figure is misleading thirty seven percent of that group live in households making more than 50 000 a year says the u s census bureau nineteen percent are in households making more than 75 000 a year 20 percent are not citizens and 33 percent are eligible for existing government programs but are not enrolled

5403661 first of all i want to help further improve the visual and aural feel of the battles waged within the game some of the first steps ive taken include increasing the size of all infantry squads so the player feels like they are in the middle of a real battle with potentially hundreds of men armed to the teeth in military hardware

5403669 this project trained young people in this community how to use photography and dialogue to identify social issues needing change and to use their photos and voices to promote that change
5403670 some kids in the projects have to deal with bad things every morning the wake up and it would be best to change that

5403672 technology has created many time and labor saving products some examples include cars elevators computers dishwashers and televisions cars are used to run short distance errands instead of people walking or riding a bicycle
5403673 with the obesity rates going up and its in our face why are we cutting p e time i dont get it
5403674 the result is that theres less time to get kids more active
5403675 we acknowledge that while the goals of these educational initiatives nclb included are good our position is that this is not an either or situation we should expect both from our schools physical activity and high academic achievement
5403676 we really feel that a national problem is that p e and health education are not included in core curriculum in schools
5403677 i think it is obvious schools are going to understandably pay the most attention to areas where they are evaluated if we continue to leave p e off the accountability records it will be hard to get schools to incorporate it
5403678 what our data is showing is that there is a cut in time devoted to physical education it just isnt as large as academic subjects
5403679 i think you have to look at many other factors when you look at obesity
5403680 to put the blame on a program that requires kids to read and do math at grade level is absurd it tends to be an excuse but it is a poor one
5403681 it stimulates more of the natural uppers in brain like dopamine and it improves working memory and problem solving skills
5403682 schools are the one thing that kids do each and every day so if p e can become a core subject in the school every child can get a strong background and we know theyll be more likely to participate in physical activity as adults
5403683 the upper echelon in our society will have more access to sports and the lower income kids will get less and less physical activity this trend keeps poverty stricken kids where they are its not getting better its getting worse in our nation
5403684 i think one interpretation is that weve privatized p e not intentionally but by cutting back on physical education in the schools
5403685 weve put parents in the position of finding these services elsewhere and families with resources can get their kids into classes and sports leagues but transportation issues and safety issues can be greater barriers for less advantaged families
5403686 part of the problem or part of the solution meeting the challenges of the energy industry
5403687 we are aware that maintaining the security of energy supplies is today no longer enough to deliver what is expected of us we need to find convincing answers to new pressing issues such as climate change and the global rise in energy prices with this report e on illustrates that it is actively involved in solving these challenges and that is has already made concrete progress and achieved success in many areas
5403688 our aim to reduce our specific co2 emissions by 50 compared to 1990 levels by 2030 is one of the most ambitious climate protection targets in our industry we want to achieve this goal mainly by investing heavily in renewable energies increasing the efficiency of our power plants using carbon capture and storage ccs technology and promoting a balanced energy mix which includes nuclear energy at the same time we see it as one of our responsibilities to help our customers use energy efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way after all the amount of energy consumed by each individual is clearly the main lever for reducing the carbon footprint and cutting energy costs
5403689 each generation technology has its specific benefits and drawbacks this is why we need an energy mix that makes optimum use of the strengths of each individual generation technology because renewables alone will not be enough to meet our energy demand for many decades to come

5403814 if the atkins diet works as well as low fat then why not recommend it
5403815 there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against the use of low carbohydrate diets particularly among participants older than age 50 years for use longer than 90 days or for diets of 20 g d or less of carbohydrates
5403816 the answer to this question is yes i e the treatment is in accordance with science and well tried experience clarification by socialstyrelsen reserving the fact that the scientific basis in the form of randomized controlled trials is much narrower than it is regarding diets with a higher content of carbohydrates and that long time trials gt 1 year is lacking furthermore considering the aforementioned reasoning its especially important that some of the practitioners self evident principles of the profession are met any kind of intervention whether it be related to drugs or lifestyle changes such as dietary advice should be followed by a thorough regular follow up and record keeping of the patients healthiness and physical data such as weight and waist measurement how the patient has apprehended the advices given and the level of appliance thereof regarding patients with type 2 diabetes and or overweight often combined with dyslipidemia or high blood pressure surveilling hba1c blood lipids blood pressure p creatinine and microalbuminuria is crucial since the longtime effects of this method are unknown there may be strong reason to recommend following up over time using a national quality registry such as the national diabetes registry that documents all of the above variables and can be used in local quality follow up
5403817 to sum up with reservation for a narrow scientific basis a lack of longtime trials and trials that evaluates the effects on patient related effect measurements cardiovascular diseases and for diabetes microvascular diabetic complications a carbohydrate tight diet can today be said to to be in accordance with science and well tried experience for reducing an overweight and type 2 diabetes the motivation being that a number of trials has shown effects in a shorter run and that no evidence for it being harmful has emerged in systematic literature researches performed so far theres no scientific support yet for treatments in excess of 1 year a thorough evaluation of long time treatment results is therefore an important demand on the practitioner

5403829 i have been attending the childrens workshops at the design museum with my daughter for more than 4 years i cannot praise the design museum highly enough for providing this kind of creative activity for children of this age group it is by far the best childrens workshop on offer in london it stands far above all the other major museums for its provision of quality of materials the fact that it has a new theme every month and the design museum education staff who are excellent in assisting the children in realising their ideas into finished pieces of work my daughter always leaves the workshops full of inspiration and often takes extra materials with her to continue at home as there never seems to be enough time to produce all the ideas she has during the workshop as a senior lecturer at central saint martins i believe that it is very important for children to participate in as much art and design as possible as they do not always have enough access to this in their school curriculum i strongly support this calibre of creative practice and hope it will long continue

5403853 its a big slumber party all day with these guys
5403854 parents should get on board and let kids express themselves
5403855 but at the same time you want them to look put together and not be embarrassed im happy to see this looser sensibility right now letting them express themselves is the prevailing parenting wisdom right now and its nice to see it echoed in fashion
5403856 prints are bright and cheerful and i say the more the merrier
5403857 its like there are no rules and thats what kids love and parents would do it too if they could
5403858 kids like to be crazy but when our parents were raising kids they couldnt allow it
5403859 our generation was allowed to break a few rules and kids now are all about expression
5403860 you have tartan plaid and a bold rugby i didnt always think of them together but now i think its a great combination
5403861 the clothes are coordinated from a color perspective and thats a really important distinction
5403862 theyre not 100 percent matchy matchy that would be interesting enough for kids but theyre coordinated
5403863 if you have a large scale stripe you probably dont want to see it paired with something the same scale its just too busy
5403864 the mixing of patterns has been going on in adult fashion for a long time for them its the tweeds with the plaid and the mixing of texture
5403865 no really i swear i know the guy who did it
5403866 yes i did that i weighed my options and at the time it looked like the best path to take i may have been wrong by it was my decision to make and i stand by it i accept responsibility for any fallout now what can we do to make it right
5403867 i tried it for a year you know working and all its not anything i would want to go through again or wish on any one in my family but i am d proud of that year
5403868 just because you pay for my house my car my big screen and my food i will not be treated like a slave back up and shut up

5403875 the laws and constitution are designed to survive and remain in force in extraordinary times
5403876 the vote was 5 4 with the courts liberal justices in the majority
5403877 jesus came to solve the problem of original sin meaning that he helps qualified individuals not to be sent to hell for their sin or imperfection in a sense jesus saves these people from god or more specifically from the righteous wrath of god which sinful human beings deserve because they have not perfectly fulfilled gods just expectations expressed in gods moral laws
5403878 jesus came to become the savior of the world meaning he came to save the earth and all it contains from its ongoing destruction because of human evil all who find in jesus gods hope and truth discover the privilege of participating in his ongoing work of personal and global transformation and liberation from evil and injustice
5403879 the biblical understanding of sin is far deeper and far worse than our contemporary understanding of evil
5403880 when we do not live within a moral world and most americans do not in their minds the language of evil has no referent evil in relation to what standard we must ask
5403881 that something could be so inherently wrong as to be called evil not simply because we see it as evil but because it is evil in itself makes no sense anymore it withers under the post modern sun it dies in the face of a thousand qualifications and a thousand cultural suspicions
5403882 sin is altogether more serious because it sets up human badness in relation to 8 as i mentioned back in 2005 and this will probably stand as my biggest

5404039 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
5404040 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
5404041 in my view there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the second amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime ridden urban areas
5404042 are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country
5404043 leaves the district of columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem including some measures regulating handguns
5404044 because a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keepand bear arms shall not be infringed
5404045 nowhere else in the constitution does a right attributed to the people refer to anything other than an individual right
5404046 t his is not a right granted by the constitution neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence the second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed emphasis in original
5404047 there seems to us no doubt on the basis of both text and history that the second amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms
5404048 there are many reasons why the militia was thought to be necessary to the security of a free state when the able bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized they are better able to resist tyranny
5404049 a constitutional guarantee subject to future judges assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them whether or not future legislatures or yes even future judges think that scope too broad
5404050 in sum we hold that the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
5404051 we therefore read united states v miller to say only that the second amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law abiding citizens for lawful purposes such as short barreled shotguns
5404052 for most of our history the bill of rights was not thought applicable to the states and the federal government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by law abiding citizens
5404053 when the able bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized they are better able to resist tyranny

5404064 it was only half full but it was pretty loud out there

5404067 you have to see it you have to feel it
5404068 they were flying the colors yesterday from senators to nationals so much so that i walked around the ballpark for an hour until i saw someone wearing anything to do with the washington redskins
5404069 on opening night or your first trip to nationals park dont bother to grade just gape and enjoy
5404070 i looked at in total about 1 532 stories on rape
5404071 i interrogated whether or not these rape myths that we have all grown up how often they are being used in the newspaper and how salient they are
5404072 my analysis has actually determined that it isnt the journalist who is responsible reporters are just reporting what they are being told its the police that are telling reporters these myths and stereotypes
5404073 only a small number of sexual assaults are reported through the media and the ones that are over emphasize the stranger danger
5404074 quite frankly the people who are raping women are not strangers they are brothers uncles dads grandpas boyfriends ex boyfriends and husbands we need to start talking about that
5404075 i see it as a lack of attention paid to these myths and a lack of media questioning these myths
5404076 one of my purposes of doing this is asking reporters and asking police to push themselves to provide an alternative frame
5404077 if we really want to be serious about improving our reporting rates we have to start rethinking how we talk about sexual violence in this country
5404078 thats how we have to start being aggressive in changing the paradigm in which media works and how police talk about rape
5404079 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments

5404082 our findings are simple increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are warming and acidifying the oceans
5404083 the impacts will be dramatic coral reef ecosystems will begin to disappear within the next 50 to 75 years warming and acidification will have devastating impacts on marine biodiversity and human livelihoods especially in developing nations that depend on reefs for much of their economic well being
5404084 it is estimated that coral reef related tourism generates tens of billions of dollars per year worldwide they are the economic engine of a vast number of economies around the world
5404085 the data collected from the coral reef components of the developing integrated ocean observing system are documenting the increase in water temperature caused by global warming and providing additional measures of the impacts of human activity on corals
5404086 corals are the sentinel of the seas and it is critical for us to listen and make adaptive responses to the warnings they are giving us

5404143 the 9600 gso has been out for a while now but we havent really seen many of them around the first one we saw was from palit and carried with it a large 768mb of memory with quite a hefty overclock to boot at the same time it did have some issues in our test bed while we loved the card we probably didnt really get to have as close a look as we normally would we all know that the 9600 gso is nothing more than an 8800 gs with a new name but how does the card sit in the current market is it something worth considering or should we just opt for the slightly more expensive 9600gt

5404147 as we roll towards the end of the month i have to admit we were a little worried when we hadnt seen the latest catalyst release no doubt amd have been extremely busy working on the latest hd 4870 incarnation the x2 there are some decent looking performance improvements mentioned in the release notes this time around so lets see how they go in our tests today

5404152 in this review frostytech is evaluating the coolermaster geminii s a low height lower noise down exhaust heatsink for intel socket 775 and amd socket 754 939 940 am2 processors coolermasters geminii s heatsink stands just 88mm tall and ships with a 120mm fan mounted to its frame an extra set of brackets allow that fan to be replaced with two 92mm or 80mm fans say if you want airflow blowing directly down onto adjacent memory slots the geminii s heatsink weighs 560grams features five 6mm dia copper heatpipes and cooling fins that descend to the cpu base
5404153 khaos is a top notch all aluminum full tower case from nzxt featuring eleven 5
5404154 the scythe zipang is top down heatsink with a huge 140mm fan on top a series of 6 copper heat pipes make this heatsink capable of cooling down an intel quad core cpu as the lowest noise levels we put it to the test and compare its performance to 45 other popular cpu coolers
5404155 the real win is having a 300 card nvidia made a lot of money with the 9800 gtx before the 4850 forced them to sell it for 200 now that bracket belongs to ati who for the first time in years is dictating hardware costs not following prices set by nvidia well have to wait for board partners to add innovation so yes the card isnt perfect but like they say its lonely at the top

5404157 we shall examine two interesting families of intel processors with 333 mhz 1333 mhz quad pumped fsb based on the relatively old conroe and relatively new wolfdale cores we selected the slowest and the fastest cpu from each series so even if you are not interested in core comparison you still get useful information about performance ranges of these cpu families
5404158 this card was the best overclockable card i have tested out of the three hd 4870 cards i have reviewed the limits allowable in the catalyst control center are 790mhz on the core and 1100mhz on the memory i was almost able to max them out with the sapphire hd 4870 reaching 785mhz on the gpu and 1095mhz on the memory for an effective speed of 4380mhz that is a very fast memory speed anything higher and the screen would artifact or i would get a bsod so the overclocked tests will be run at 785 1095mhz
5404159 earlier this week catalyst 8 7 went live on the amd server so we thought we would check it out and report on 8 7s performance this catalyst release was fairly major as it was the first to support atis newest hd 4000 series video cards for this brief article we had two main goals first off to see how much if any performance gains were made for a hd 3870 going from catalyst 8 6 to 8 7 and second to see what levels of performance crossfirex setups using multiple hd 4000 could offer
5404160 rosewill has long had a reputation of providing a quality product for an affordable price with that theme in mind these guys have come up with a line of power supplies aimed at the enthusiast market they still look at providing an affordable power solution but this time around they have added features to keep those with extreme power needs happy the xtreme series of power supplies weigh in at models from 630 watts to 850 watts today we will take a look at the little guy in the lineup the 630 watt model to see what it can do with a reasonably intense system stability will be key so we will look not only the level of power but also at whether or not it can maintain this level with little to no fluctuations

5404164 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5404165 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5404166 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5404172 this totally changes the perspective a customer has on how they can do business with sun and how they can do business with intel
5404173 we believe that sun has put the wheels in motion to rekindle the relationship it once had with intel on x86 servers
5404174 over the years mcnealy has taken real potshots at intel
5404175 that was especially during the period of time when sun was doing their own chips the sparc in that sense the fact that sun is becoming more chummy with intel might be a surprise but it also reflects more of reality the fact that intels chips are extremely powerful and as competitive as amds offering

5404218 we are being pushed rapidly down a route largely determined by the technological environment we have a small degree of control over the spread of these tools but that control does not extend to our being able to reverse stop or even radically alter the direction were moving in our principal challenge is not to decide where we want to go but rather to stay upright as we go there

5404232 tonight we knew as a team we could do a 54 but 53 was phenomenal
5404233 to be honest all we were really thinking about was getting the gold medal not breaking the world record again
5404234 we gave 100 percent and thats what you get to me the medal is more important than the record i got a bronze in sydney and silver in athens gold is what we wanted
5404235 we came in confident especially after qualifying we knew we had something special but that time wow
5404236 all of us are focussed on one thing and thats making time weve just been trying to get as much momentum as we can
5404237 after not being here for eight years to say im in the finals again after having a child makes me happy
5404238 no one thought i was going to make it out the heats its easy to lose faith and begin to ask am i really that good its like im starting the season from scratch
5404239 i realised no matter what happened i had to keep my mind focused if you dont believe in yourself its not going to happen so i believe in myself
5404240 in the final i just want to do the same thing just with more speed
5404241 i know my starts are good yesterday i held back a bit
5404242 i clipped some of the hurdles today and i need to rectify that for tomorrow i know i can break the british record i can feel that its there i was hitting hurdles and still ran 12 84 im really pleased
5404243 im not going to complain though a win is a win
5404244 it was nervous occasion for me i realised how important it was for me to get this win and thank god i did i caught him with a couple of bad right hands and im not really sure what happened to his leg
5404245 im over the moon to have got in the medals and ive done it for the whole team weve got one in the bank and hopefully well follow with two more
5404246 it was a good result so im not disappointed with my fourth
5404247 my dream has been to be in the final so now ill have to leave it until london in 2012 to get a medal
5404248 because i had nothing to lose i qualified for this final in last place so i just had to go out there and do it
5404249 we made a mistake at the beginning of the race and every boat who was in with a chance of a medal wanted to cover us
5404250 but we pulled up got into synch in the second bit of the race and got where we needed to be
5404251 we had a really hard start and to come through is so pleasing that was the most intense race i have ever been involved in im so pleased
5404252 i thought i had a great day on the water today
5404253 i nailed each start and i think just had patience it was pretty shifty so you just had to wait for the shifts to come back
5404254 i just held my nerve took the right shifts and sailed really well
5404255 i was looking at our series going into today and it looked reasonable
5404256 it was just missing some good results so fortunately we managed to get two out of three that were good today that brings it to a respectable series but there
5404257 i dont think i could have done any better we all did our best but we were fighting against it from the start
5404258 i cant be unhappy with how i went today at all though and it has given me confidence ahead of thursdays final
5404259 shes jumping better and better each day and if i ride her well we can be in the top end of the individual final
5404260 but as a whole we climbed the world rankings and beat some good teams you have to look at the bigger picture it was not good tonight but overall in the tournament it was pretty good
5404261 its very serious we have got lots of resources there

5404292 i mean that if his wife wanted to see someone or be with someone i couldnt trust that
5404293 then why do you feel the need to restrict the openness in your relationship
5404294 because she might just go out and look for something better
5404295 great so its not for you thats absolutely fine what if i told you that the woman in my life was say bisexual
5404296 so she called me the other night from a business trip and told me about someone she met in the hotel she was staying in
5404297 well without betraying a trust i can tell you that she met a new friend i dont need to share anymore its no ones business but ours
5404298 you have missed the entire point its not about what you feel you need to know its about how we live our lives
5404299 thats none of your business and im offended that you would ask such a question
5404300 youre an actor we work with gays lesbians crossdressers adulterers every possible sexual position you can imagine how can you be so closed to an idea that first and foremost begins with trust with communication and has much more to do with how you live your life than a quick fuck how do you do your job onstage without maintaining an open approach to the character

5404302 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5404303 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5404304 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5404305 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5404306 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5404307 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room

5404328 there are many research internships and early admission college attendance programs but ours is probably the only one in the country with that formal commitment from the school district we have the students from 9th through 12th grade there is an academic year and summer component and courses are high school honors accredited
5404329 a huge pool of resources in terms of personnel and laboratory facilities
5404330 connects the sciences and math through real world problems and solutions
5404331 they will learn by asking questions what questions do you ask in research and then how do you try to figure out the answer
5404332 we can have a single subject such as brain power
5404333 and then connect several disciplines through the idea of energy we talk about the biological and physiological basis for energy in our own bodies we can also talk about the chemical basis what does it really mean when we say atp is broken to release energy which then powers us and then we can compare that to other energy systems artificial such as combustion engines engineering or in other organisms such as plants botany theres a vast array of pieces that can be captured and integrated with a concept as broad as energy
5404334 theres a lot of potential to fold students back into the csos other k 12 and community programs

5404340 ive looked at that sentence several times and cant make head or tail of it because its totally at odds with all meaningful available metrics
5404341 i will be the first to admit that several years ago when i first heard about the red crescent i assumed that it was a matter of co incidence after researching the design i found there are many 8 additional co incidents which cause one to question the design and the designer
5404342 because the earth is round you can face any direction and be facing mecca
5404343 i know that it will be an up hill fight but our flight 93 heroes deserve a better memorial than one that also pays tribute to the islamic terrorists
5404344 it is an insult to my son tom and to the other murdered heroes of flight 93 who stopped islamic terrorists from destroying the white house or the capitol that terrible september day
5404345 that is like seeing an airliner fly into the world trade center and thinking that it cant be intentional
5404346 worst of all the memorial project refuses to confront voluminous evidence that the islamic symbolism is intentional
5404347 i want people to think and to look at the design
5404348 faced with a plot against our nation he and the other heroes of flight 93 fought back and at the cost of their lives foiled that plot to destroy the white house or the capitol now it is time for the rest of us to face our moment of truth flight 93 has been rehijacked and i am requesting that if you can demand that a proper investigation of the memorial project be conducted
5404349 they take great pleasure in attacking him we have freedoms everyone has a right to voice their opinion that is what happened on the airplane tom didnt look for or recruit people to support him others saw the same thing
5404350 those who have most recently appointed themselves to protect the memorial misguidedly believe that their repeatedly shown to be false assumptions actually somehow support their opinion that the design and the selection process were flawed
5404351 the design selection process was democratic and the majority ruled
5404352 jurors gave all of mr burnetts concerns a complete airing and he even gave his consent to support what the majority picked now he and others want a do over no one agreed then with mr burnetts preferred choice for a final design so now we have thinly veiled challenges of the design and the process that are the same old claims this is the same old hash being re heated with a hotter flame i dont see how anyone who takes the time to see how the hash was made is going to think it tastes better this manufactured controversy is quite disappointing and is ever more hurtful to other family members they may have preferred another design but now support the one chosen knowing as did those on the plane the majority rules
5404353 it is unfortunate that so many good citizens are being misled by a few self proclaimed saviors of all things proper and patriotic
5404354 the level of misinformation and obfuscation related to the open and democratic process that has driven the development and progress of the flight 93 national memorial design is discouraging nevertheless we are confident that when presented with the facts related to the design and design process those individuals in opposition to the design will see its simplistic beauty and ability to honor the 40 heroes of united flight 93
5404355 as a place of honor and healing not as a religious icon
5404356 the success of our petition shows that the american people object to these islamic symbol shapes whether they are intentional or not
5404357 i know it will be an uphill fight but our flight 93 heroes deserve a better memorial than one that also pays tribute to the islamic terrorists
5404358 this fight transcends politics it is not a republican or democrat issue it is americans demanding that our flight 93 heroes get a national memorial that honors their memory not the memory of islamic terrorists
5404359 if 5 000 signatures coming from 50 states and more than a dozen foreign nations are not enough to get the design changed then we will begin contacting veterans fraternal civic and religious organizations along with the national media to apply more pressure for change
5404360 they decided that were just not going to address the issue of islamic symbolism

5404366 resulta adem s que cobos no es ni ministro ni miembro del gabinete sino vicepresidente y una de las responsabilidades constitucionales del vicepresidente es desempatar en el senado esa responsabilidad no la tiene el presidente sino el vice y es justamente un mecanismo de control sobre el presidente lo que en este caso vino muy bien porque la presidencia hab a perdido los estribos

5404383 the tragic events of march 1 show that even when people have ample time and opportunity to take cover from a devastating tornado the need for proper shelter is imperative
5404384 despite warning lead times that exceeded national standards 19 lives were lost our team concluded that survival in violent tornadoes often depends on reaching an adequate hardened safe room
5404385 we saw permanent structures completely removed from their foundations during the march 1 outbreak
5404386 hardened safe rooms are essential for tornado safety this is perhaps the only thing that could have made a difference for the students in enterprise
5404387 tornado warnings were in place the entire time and the team agreed that shelter in place was the best response
5404388 three successive supercell thunderstorms moved over or near enterprise during that time
5404389 we believe the warnings and response would have been the same under storm based warnings this is just one of those cases where everyone did everything they could the only thing left is the hardened safe room

5404399 de travailler avec des groupes dopposition et de passer de largent
5404400 il y a eu un grand nombre discussions importantes haut niveau
5404401 reste des incertitudes importantes sur l tendue de cette implication
5404402 nous cr erons des g n rations de djihadistes et nos petits enfants se battront contre nos ennemis ici m me en am rique
5404403 disons juste que je suis ici pour exprimer mon point de vue
5404404 exer ait une tr s forte pression en sens contraire
5404405 quau moins dix officiers g n raux dont des commandants aux combats
5404406 ont pes le pour et le contre sur cette question
5404407 les attaquer comme moyen dobtenir ce changement m tonne comme n tant pas le ur premier choix
5404408 trop de gens pensent que lon doit tre soit pour soit contre les iraniens
5404409 ai je pest contre certaines choses qui taient propos es vous pouvez en tre s r certaines taient vraiment tr s stupides
5404410 le processus de supervision na pas tenu le rythme il a t coopt
5404411 le processus est rompu et cest un truc dangereux que nous sommes en train dautoriser
5404412 la cia avait besoin de cette conclusion pour faire son boulot habituel mais la conclusion ne sapplique pas au jsoc le pr sident a sign un d cret pr sidentiel apr s le 11 septembre donnant au pentagone lautorisation de faire des choses quil navait jamais pu faire auparavant sans en notifier le congr s il tait pr tendu que larm e pr parait lespace de bataille et en utilisant ce terme ils pouvaient contourner la surveillance parlementaire tout est justifi dans la s mantique pour livrer la guerre mondiale contre la terreur
5404413 ladministration a brouill les pistes dhabitude il y avait des nuances
5404414 lagence dit que nous ne nous mettrons pas en position daider tuer des gens sans une conclusion
5404415 lautorisation globale inclut cette de tuer mais ce nest pas comme si c tait ce quils se pr paraient faire cest une question de collecte dinformation de recrutement de soutiens
5404416 lex cutif comprend que nous nessayons pas de leur dicter ce quils doivent faire
5404417 nous essayons simplement de nous assurer que ce quils font est en accord avec les valeurs am ricaines et quils ne font pas courir dennuis au pays
5404418 je soup onne que quelque chose est en cours mais je ne sais pas quoi en penser cheney a toujours voulu attaquer liran et sil disposait de plus de temps il trouverait un moyen de le faire nous nobtenons toujours pas suffisamment dinformations de la part des agences de renseignement et jai tr s peu confiance quils nous donnent des informations sensibles
5404419 nest que cela une notification et pas une approbation des activit s une surveillance correcte des activit s despionnage en cours se fait en informant compl tement les membres de la commission des renseignements
5404420 la r gle est que nous ne commentons pas dans un sens ou dans lautre les all gations dactivit s secr tes ou de pr tendues conclusions
5404421 cela prendra encore une ann e avant que nous puissions contr ler les activit s des services secrets
5404422 nous contr lons largent et ils ne peuvent rien faire sans argent largent est le nerf de la guerre mais je me m fie beaucoup de cette administration
5404423 ils nont t absolument daucune utilit tr s nuisibles et je ne tol re absolument aucune de leurs activit s et je nai toujours pas vu le moindre signe depuis que je fais ce boulot quune action publique de liran ait pu tre dutilit dans cette r gion
5404424 lorsque je suis arriv centcom les iraniens finan aient toutes les entit s lint rieur de lirak il tait dans leur int r t de nous faire partir et ils ont donc d cid de tuer autant dam ricains quils pouvaient et pourquoi pas ils ne savaient pas qui prendrait les r nes mais ils voulaient nous voir partir jai d cid que je ne pouvais pas r soudre la situation en irak sans ses voisins pour r soudre ce probl me en irak nous avons d dune mani re ou dune autre impliquer liran et la syrie jai d travailler le voisinage
5404425 cela se produirait seulement si les iraniens faisaient quelque chose de stupide
5404426 lune des raisons pour laquelle la maison blanche lavait choisi pour centcom tait quil est connu pour tre un penseur strat gique et quil avait d montr ces qualit s dans le pacifique
5404427 il fut charg de trouver une strat gie densemble coh rente pour liran lirak et lafghanistan et en vertu de la loi le commandant des combats est responsable de toutes les op rations militaires dans sa zone dop ration cela ne sest pas produit
5404428 lorsque fallon a essay de comprendre toutes les activit s secr tes manifestes men es par larm e dans sa zone de responsabilit un petit groupe la maison blanche len a emp ch
5404429 la coh rence de la strat gie militaire s rode cause de linfluence civile indue et de la direction des op rations militaires non conventionnelles
5404430 si vous avez des petits groupes qui planifient et conduisent des op rations militaires sans que le commandant des combats le sache et le contr le par d faut vous ne pouvez pas avoir une strat gie militaire coh rente vous finissez avec un d sastre comme le sont les efforts de reconstruction en irak
5404431 le renard ma dit quil y avait plein de trucs pas nets qui se d roulaient aux op sp ciales et je lui ai dit quil devait se faire une id e sur ce quils tramaient vraiment
5404432 les types des op sp ciales finirent par se rendre compte quils avaient besoin du renard et ils ont donc commenc lui parler le renard aurait remport son combat contre les op sp ciales sil ny avait eu cheney
5404433 fallon a t limin parce que sa mani re il essayait de pr venir une guerre contre liran et on doit ladmirer pour cela
5404434 est tr s ouverte pour d crire les tueries qui ont lieu lint rieur du pays
5404435 une presse contr l e qui consid re quil est plus important de publier ces choses nous commen ons voir lint rieur du gouvernement
5404436 pratiquement pas un seul jour ne se passe aujourdhui o nous ne voyons pas daffrontement quelque part il y a eu trois ou quatre incidents au cours dun des derniers week ends et les iraniens donnent m me les noms des officiers des gardes r volutionnaires qui ont t tu s
5404437 le nec plus ultra pour les iraniens accuser la cia
5404438 cest nouveau et cest une escalade une augmentation de la tension cela renforce le soutien au r gime et montre au peuple quil y a une menace continue de la part du grand satan
5404439 nous sommes expos s cause de notre transfert darmes et de notre mat riel de communication les iraniens auront la capacit de prendre pour argument que lopposition a t inspir e par les am ricains combien de fois avons nous essay ceci sans poser les bonnes questions le jeu en vaut il la chandelle
5404440 ce nest pas parce que le liban lirak et le pakistan ont des probl mes ethniques que cela signifie que liran est confront la m me question
5404441 liran est un vieux pays comme la france ou lallemagne et ses citoyens sont tout aussi nationalistes les etats unis surestiment la tension ethnique en iran
5404442 on peut toujours trouver des groupes militants qui iront tuer un policier mais travailler avec les minorit s se retournera contre nous et nous ali nera la majorit de la population
5404443 les baloutchis sont des fondamentalistes sunnites qui ha ssent le r gime de t h ran mais on peut les d crire comme faisant partie da
5404444 se sont des types qui coupent la t te des incroyants et dans ce cas les incroyants sont les chiites iraniens lironie est quune nouvelle fois nous travaillons avec des fondamentalistes sunnites exactement comme nous lavons fait en afghanistan dans les ann es 80
5404445 cest une organisation salafiste vicieuse dont les fid les ont suivi les cours de la m me madrasa que les taliban et les extr mistes pakistanais ils sont soup onn s davoir des liens avec al qa da et on pense aussi quils sont li s la culture du pavot
5404446 le nouveau corps exp ditionnaire travaillera avec le m e k ladministration attend d sesp r ment des r sultats
5404447 le m e k na pas qui v rifie ses comptes et lon pense que ses dirigeants se sont remplis les poches pendant des ann es si les gens savaient ce que touche le m e k et les sommes qui atterrissent sur ses comptes bancaires et pourtant cela est pratiquement inutile pour les objectifs quattend ladministration
5404448 maliki choisit de plus en plus les int r ts de lirak plut t que ceux des etats unis
5404449 maliki est r ticent jouer le jeu consistant accuser liran
5404450 semblent nuire aux relations avec les gouvernements la fois de lirak et du pakistan et pourraient bien renforcer le lien entre t h ran et bagdad
5404451 ce programme marche parce quil est petit et que des types intelligents le g rent
5404452 il est ex cut par des professionnels la nsa la cia et la dia
5404453 sont l sur le terrain avec les forces sp ciales et les renseignements pakistanais et ils soccupent de types vraiment m chants
5404454 nous devons vraiment faire tr s attention lorsque nous demandons lintervention des missiles nous devons toucher certaines maisons certains moments les gens sur le terrain observent la jumelle une distance de quelques centaines de m tres et donnent les localisations en latitude et en longitude nous laissons r der le pr dateur jusqu ce que les cibles localisent une maison et nous devons nous assurer que nos hommes sont suffisamment loin afin de ne pas tre touch s
5404455 tout le monde se querelle sur la liste de cibles de haute valeur
5404456 les gars des op sp ciales sont nerv s parce que le cabinet de cheney fixe les priorit s sur des cat gories de cibles et il est d sormais impatient et exerce des pressions pour obtenir des r sultats mais cela prend beaucoup de temps pour que les bonnes personnes soient en place
5404457 nous avons eu dexcellents r sultats dans la corne de lafrique avec lutilisation dindicateurs et de leurres des tactiques basiques de contre espionnage et de contre insurrection et nous avons commenc les embrouiller en afghanistan mais la maison blanche va tuer ce programme si elle lutilise contre liran cest une chose de sengager dans des frappes et des assassinats s lectifs au wazirist n et cela en est une autre en iran la maison blanche pense que la m me chose peut sappliquer partout mais les questions l gales entourant les assassinats extrajudiciaires au wazirist n sont moins un probl me parce da et les taliban traversent la fronti re pour entrer en afghanistan et en revenir souvent avec les forces de lotan leur poursuite la situation na rien daussi clair dans le cas de liran toutes les consid rations judiciaires strat giques et politiques sont diff rentes en iran
5404458 il y a une immense opposition au sein de la communaut des renseignements lid e de livrer une guerre secr te lint rieur de liran et dutiliser les baloutchis et les ahwazis comme substituts les dirigeants de notre communaut des op rations sp ciales ont tous un courage remarquable mais ils sont moins enclins exprimer leur opposition cette politique liran nest pas le wazirist n
5404459 oui cest plus s rieux que ce que nous avions consid r mais pour remettre les choses dans leur contexte nous communiquons vraiment r guli rement avec les gardes r volutionnaires et leur marine
5404460 je nai pas eu le sentiment en lisant les rapports que je recevais quil y avait une raison d tre effray par ces cinq bateaux
5404461 le sujet tait comment cr er un casus belli entre t h ran et washington
5404462 tre possible de ne pas geler le programme nucl aire iranien pour la dur e des n gociations afin d viter une confrontation militaire avant quelles ne soient achev es si cette nouvelle tentative devait chouer les choses deviendraient rapidement s rieuses mortellement s rieuses
5404463 cette proposition dit que les iraniens doivent cesser de fabriquer des centrifugeuses et lautre camp mettra un terme toutes les activit s suppl mentaires de sanction au sein du conseil de s curit des nations unies
5404464 ceci pourrait tre acceptable pour les iraniens sils font preuve de bonne volont
5404465 je pense que les am ricains sont profond ment divis s sur la question de ce quil fait faire au sujet de liran
5404466 certains officiels sont pr occup s par les retomb es dune attaque militaire et dautres pensent quune attaque est in vitable je connais les europ ens mais je nai aucune id e jusquo iront les am ricains sur cette question
5404467 est une politique unilat rale de rencontre au sommet fa on cow boy
5404468 quil dit cheney et aux autres ce quils veulent entendre
5404469 si en otras pocas entreg bamos a las palabras el ca tico batiburrillo externo para que nos lo devolvieran ordenado clasificado e inteligible ahora nos dan una realidad inveros mil este fen meno es consecuencia de la inestabilidad l xica que afecta a vocablos clave del lenguaje p blico la confusi n sem ntica encierra toda la crisis de sentido de nuestro tiempo
5404470 lo que define la poca actual es la amplitud de la confusi n los significados inestables son los mismos en pa ses en los que se hablan lenguas distintas y la inestabilidad afecta a palabras esenciales del vocabulario pol tico
5404471 es como si me llenara la cabeza de ideas s lo que no sabr a decir cu les son lo que est claro es que alguien ha matado algo

5404491 our teacher had us plan for months to be pioneers in fifth grade
5404492 we loaded up on a bus and pulled makeshift wagons across a field had lunch that is one of my best memories of school thats fifth grade to me
5404493 a shift in our everyday experiences of space and time at a very basic level
5404494 a set of cognitive skills that people acquire and contain within themselves
5404495 but theres a move away from this to the idea that the nature of what it means to be literate is imminently social we have begun to see literacy as a set of social practices where people make and use all manner of texts to act and interpret the world in meaningful ways
5404496 there have been many studies conducted in the lab or in isolated classrooms
5404497 but we dont really know a lot about the connections kids make across space and time or about how they experience an entire day
5404498 literacy now is about communicating and using visual text sound digital forms of communication as well as nondigital forms
5404499 if there is a class discussion on facebook they will see it more readily than if they have to actively go to a separate academic space
5404500 its something that interacts more natively with their everyday practices
5404501 theres a disconnection between what students are experiencing in and outside of school
5404502 in some cases we have kids who look incredibly connected and able and engaged in social practices with literacy online but when you follow them inside school they look disconnected they look unable teachers talk about them as being poor readers and writers
5404503 kids spend a lot of time crafting images and especially transforming and remixing images from popular cultural texts
5404504 they scratch out something that looks like a second grader drew it
5404505 there is this wildly expanding world of what people are doing with literacy outside of school
5404506 but when you introduce new tools into school without fairly substantial rethinking about how the tool the system of activity and the beliefs about learning change that tool becomes just another thing like the things you are already using

5404520 our merger with cinergy last year gave our power business the increased scope and scale it needed to have an industry leading position in the united states we are the third largest in coal generation were fourth in nuclear generation and second in hydroelectric capacity among investor owned utilities
5404521 we believe we can create greater long term value for our shareholders as a stand alone power company than if we had remained combined with the gas transportation storage and processing operations our employee incentive target of 1 15 per share based on ongoing diluted eps for 2007 serves as the base for our 4 to 6 percent annual growth through the end of 2009 also we anticipate a target dividend payout ratio in the range of 70 to 75 percent
5404522 the franchised electric amp gas and commercial power segments are expected to provide approximately 85 percent of our 2007 ongoing segment ebit through sales to our regulated customers
5404523 the merger and the spinoff required an incredible amount of work over the last year and we congratulate our employees on these major accomplishments
5404524 additionally we have a talented experienced management team that is focused on delivering strong and attractive earnings growth for our shareholders both in the short term as well as over the longer term

5404542 i cant believe this many people came through a blizzard to play the tournament had 256 participants who began lining up inside the campus center while the snow fell outside on the eve of the event
5404543 its like they choose blindfolded when character select is on random
5404544 oh my god its so intense the whole excitement and the rush
5404545 for those who need further explanation that would be like attending an event in newark new jersey and having someone awkwardly scream

5404601 just how it is in the non union entertainment industry
5404602 this is just how it is so i guess ill just accept it if i want to be a part of this
5404603 it is possible for many dancers to band together and form a trade association of sorts if there were enough membership in something like that then it could be possible to negotiate some type of group policy which would make it much less expensive to individual members that would probably require a very large base of members
5404604 we have reached the stage with the bellydance superstars that we can now confidently take a long term view of the business and recognize the need to take good care of our stars most of all as we now need them consistently we have to free them from financial worries by giving them job security including such things as health insurance we also have to give them a nice upside so they will want to remain part of our enterprise from the very beginning i believed it important to create high quality performance and instructional product and to pay the participants on a par to music stars of course i found this was highly unusual and dancers had been used to getting very little or nothing in the past i have seen some of these other deals and was appalled my deals give a cash advance better than anyone else has ever paid and a nice respectable royalty even when compared to the big music and film business for our touring troupe we are in the process of offering contracts with guaranteed weekly wages even when we are not working all these contracts also provide health care by the middle of this year we will be in a position to offer all our dancers contracts including the roses i do not want them working in restaurants or in demeaning situations and i want them not worrying where the next dollar is coming from
5404605 the other bit of bad news is that hannah nour had to leave the tour due to back injury and that left a man down that had to be filled by others or pieces re arranged with one less
5404606 it doesnt matter whether it was in rehearsals or on tour or whether shed been with the company for a few days or a few years its a workplace injury incurred in performing job related duties rehearsing is just as much a part of the job as performing
5404607 if the kind of dancing we required was radically different from what the dancer did as her normal performance and that dancing was pushing the envelope of the average dancers body then the dance company would have to be complicit in the injury
5404608 i think its very disturbing that you dont consider the rehearsal to be part of the job
5404609 peoples propensity to see me as just some exploitive businessman
5404610 so if she isnt being covered by wc with all its warts why not didnt you immediately have her fill out the necessary forms have someone take her to a hospital keep yourself posted on her progress
5404611 we cover all medical bills when a dancer works for us
5404612 why did sheri not have insurance if she is a professional dancer who has been doing this for some time if you want to keep posting on this issue answer that for me please
5404613 cover all medical bills when a dancer works for you
5404614 meanwhile i presume you are all voting democratic and then the health insurance issue might go away if they get a big enough majority in the two houses to pass the appropriate legislation a democratic president will surely submit
5404615 why is it not in the minds of you dancers that are critical of me that buying insurance is something you should be doing as a matter of course
5404616 sheris case is an unfortunate one but quite different from one of our dancers who is with us full time who of course we cover medically and are happy to do so
5404617 i never even got the chance to go on tour and prove myself since i got injured in rehearsals
5404618 the individual does not always do the smart thing and get themselves insured
5404619 youll never work in this town again if i have anything to do with it
5404620 why put yourself in a situation that can burn a bridge when you dont need to
5404621 if anyone of you dare to unintentionally make me look bad in the public or didnt actively make sure what you said in the public wouldnt have any chance of making me look bad i will see to it that you will not get a chance in the bd world
5404622 to be fair i also knew that bdss would not be providing health insurance going into this
5404623 those dancers that work full time for the bdss and only the bdss we take care of and always will
5404624 at the same time if any dancer came to me who was a part timer and said they had health insurance and the monthly payments were x and would i pay that monthly payment for the month s they toured with the bdss my answer would be yes that would be fair given the circumstances
5404625 i sure wish i could have known x or thought to ask questions y and z let others be educated by our past mistakes or simple naivety
5404626 we take care of our full time dancers as we do our full time employees we cover all medical bills when a dancer works for us
5404627 those dancers that work full time for the bdss and only the bdss we take care of and always will they are an investment and we aim to protect our investment as we can afford more and more of the dancers to be full time we will bare the full burdon of their commitment including health
5404628 we are a bright bunch here and might notice inconsistencies
5404629 sheris case is an unfortunate one but quite different from one of our dancers who is with us full time who of course we cover medically and are happy to do so we take out insurance on a tour by tour basis for dancers who work with us on that basis
5404630 i cannot say that if you rehearsed with us for 4 days never did even one show and appeared to have great difficulty with the reality of the work involved and the level of professionalism required that i would be in a position to help a great deal
5404631 and appeared to have great difficulty with the reality of the work involved and the level of professionalism required
5404632 i presume logically that means she also now regards her critique of me as beyond her expertise and withdraws her critique in that regard as well
5404633 i connected sherri with my workers comp carrier the carrier determined upon investigating the injury and terms of employment that a sherri didnt qualify as an employee and in fact was an independent contractor and b her injury was absolutely unrelated to her activities with bdss thereby nullifying any liability on our part and unfortunately leaving her to deal with her medical problems on her own we have acted as the law requires
5404634 dancers who are full time with the company and have been so for several years that means we pay year round work or no work
5404635 others choose to select the tours they want to do leaving others out so they can maintain their other interests husbands etc

5404658 its kind of the cut to the chase evolution of cupcakes
5404659 i can imagine it being at parties its a great thing to have at an office party it provides just a little bite of sweetness and yumminess without going whole hog
5404660 i see fingers getting involved but theres no shame we dont judge here at sprinkles
5404661 you order the cupcake but you really want the frosting
5404662 it brings you back to when you used to lick the container or whatever your mom made it in
5404663 its really about developing frosting for the person who cant keep their hand out of the frosting bowl
5404664 some people are so focused on the frosting theyll walk out with 10 different frostings of all different flavors
5404665 the frosting shot seems like an inevitable arc in the trajectory of the cupcake industry its not the kind of food concoction that can be traced back to one person or party
5404666 this is like a classic food trend a lot of people are thinking of the same thing at the same time which is really how most food things start
5404667 were not talking molecular gastronomy its kind of reducing down to the basic element of what a cupcake is
5404668 it really became a big thing i tried to stop offering them
5404669 but i would see people on the street and theyd be like where are the frosting shots they would get on my case about that
5404670 we tried to think of what we could do why would people come in the evening they tend to come during the day and could go somewhere else and have a cocktail
5404671 i think its the connotation of its a shot and what in the world is it people are just curious
5404672 it was with just the right amount and just the right price it was exactly what i wanted
5404673 they should all consider doing this theyd get some good response from this and get people in a good mood because its funny
5404674 a careful plan or method the art of devising or employing plans or stratagems toward a goal
5404675 okay let me get some of it done see if i can actually make a commitment to writing a book and get back to you
5404676 i want two girls then if a third child happened to enter the equation it can be a boy no problem
5404677 alors quelle se battait la poitrine tel un gorille en rut un comportement du
5404678 if we allow ourselves to fear them we wont do anything
5404679 then i would consider myself a partner in the crimes taking place in egypt
5404680 they kept saying oh the men who beat you were just a few bad guys we love egypt too we love this country as much as you do but egyptians arent ready for democracy just look at what happened in iraq
5404681 it is very hard to see something like this happen and its especially hard because it involves a young girl
5404682 we certainly hope that there will not be lasting effects its a long standing and strong alliance
5404683 although we have these problems thanks to the efforts of both sides japan u s security cooperation has continued to progress
5404684 okinawa is very important not only for japan but for the united states
5404685 from that point of view the incident in okinawa is very unfortunate and it is also unfortunate for the bilateral alliance between our countries
5404686 the agency recommends paying close attention to computer company manuals
5404687 i saw the movie and i thought the doctor was dashing and doing important things that appealed to me and i decided that was what i would do
5404688 when i came here my career was almost completely consumed with bacterial meningitis now because of three new vaccines that disease has been greatly diminished when i think back to the suffering caused by that disease it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to know that we are now preventing that suffering
5404689 worldwide 70 children die of rotavirus every hour with this new vaccine we can prevent the deaths of 70 children every hour vaccine can do this
5404690 in my parents generation no one went to college but all of their children not only went to college they also completed advanced degrees
5404691 half of my high school class didnt go on to college
5404692 i received some letters of inquiry from the ivy schools and i was encouraged to apply
5404693 i was turned down by every one of them which was the best thing that ever happened to me
5404694 then my first day on the pediatric wards i knew i wanted to be a doctor to kids
5404695 pediatrics was probably the strongest and most dynamic division at ohio state
5404696 i have cared for children with autism and i am eager to find a cause but vaccines are not the cause
5404697 as vaccines make us safe people forget about these diseases measles rubella pertussis polio meningitis but ive seen all these diseases they are terrible when we hear about an outbreak of one of these forgotten diseases the result is usually panic and people forget concerns
5404698 kate is a really fair reporter we dont know what she thinks about the issues and thats how it should be
5404699 they had done some stuff in vista to prohibit this form of attack from being successful on third party software
5404700 we had to do some porting to get around that issue
5404701 the three missile salvos we fired all went wide of the target as expected and we were jumping around the crisis center biting our nails and shrieking like frightened schoolgirls as we helplessly watched the school bus sized satellite hurtle toward the ground at 30 000 miles per hour imagine our relief when we learned it plonked straight into osamas cave vaporizing the bastard thats an unexpected feather in all of our caps
5404702 no conscious effort had been made whatsoever to use the satellite as an anti terrorist weapon the execution of osama bin laden was merely a lucky side effect of our incompetence coupled with a fortuitous trajectory
5404703 if it happened once we can make it happen again
5404704 uncontrolled spaceborne school buses filled with toxic fuel might be just the silver bullet weve been looking for to get an edge in the global conflict based on the osama hit it seems the things want to seek out and crash land directly on evildoers and i say let them theres plenty more out there waiting to get smacked

static analysis citing irrelevant results and false positives as key pain points but is there a more effective way to channel the energy required for good fuzzing in order to find more bugs faster this presentation will propose a series of techniques for customizing static rather than dynamic tools that will let you find more and better quality bugs than you ever thought possible we compare static and dynamic approaches to testing and look at the fundamental problems involved in fuzzing why static analysis is harder for humans to think about than fuzzing interfaces for customizing static analysis tools the kinds of bugs static analysis is good at finding why static analysis is both faster and more thorough then fuzzing where static analysis tools break down the talk concludes with the results of an experiment we conducted on open source code to compare the effectiveness of fuzzing and static analysis at finding a known set of security bugs

5404765 previously most small to mid sized financial organizations were simply focused on being compliant within the timeframe without trying deploy a best practices approach largely because virtually all solutions either required major it deployments or were difficult for consumers to adopt or both
5404766 but now client certificates combine the best of both worlds security and ease of use so banks and credit unions can provide a better customer experience within a highly secured environment
5404767 weve witnessed an important transition in how financial institutions value authentication technology
5404768 whereas in the past organizations tended to make investments to meet the basic requirements now these institutions are able to move up to a best practices approach that can enhance customer satisfaction but be highly secure and cost effective this authentication model is best delivered by a certification authority because our core competency is to enable authenticated sensitive transactions which can be trusted by all parties

5404777 weve found that some companies have complex e mail needs spanning multiple domains
5404778 these sites are often found in universities and government environments where each department often had their own domains in the isp world the merger activity has brought multiple domains under one roof web hosts can host thousands or even hundreds of thousands of domains until now no anti spam tool has been flexible enough to simplify the management of multiple domains and allow a super system administrator to delegate system administration rights which in turn allows the designated system administrator to offer per user or per group filtering
5404779 obstinate clock at a season and a half thats got to be some kind of record
5404780 for many americans there is no more pressing concern than the price of gasoline truckers and farmers and small business owners have been hit especially hard every american who drives to work purchases food or ships a product has felt the effect
5404781 unilaterally open up some ocs exploration and development by simply canceling the executive moratorium put in place by his father and president clinton he has had the power to do that for the past six years but has not done so
5404782 the white house said congress should lift the moratorium first and then bush would end the executive order because presidential action alone would not lead to new offshore drilling
5404783 what if you happen upon a glass whose contents are at the halfway mark in this case the person has not interacted with the glass so what is it half full or half empty
5404784 what if the person has no intention of interacting with the glass then what is it
5404785 historically there always has been an unavoidable tension between efforts to bolster american competitiveness read as efforts to boost the performance of elite students especially in science math and engineering and those to promote educational equity champions of particular federal initiatives tend to argue that the two notions are complementary but trends of the last fifty years show that the ascendance of one tends to take attention from the other
5404786 an act to close the achievement gap with accountability flexibility and choice so that no child is left behind
5404787 its probably incorrect to say american education has grown worse over the past few decades
5404788 however spending has tripled over the past 35 years and american education hasnt improved either in no case does it seem were adding a lot of value
5404789 despite the rhetorical centrality of education in the policy debate on competitiveness
5404790 was earmarked to support math science and technological education in k 12 schooling and even that amount has fallen prey to political infighting among various members of congress
5404791 providing students with educational opportunities tailored to their rates of learning
5404792 every child should have the opportunity to learn something new every day
5404793 there are many gifted kids coming from low socioeconomic status backgrounds
5404794 when you remove programs for the gifted you dont hurt kids from highly advantaged educated middle and upper middle class backgrounds as much those parents can find and afford alternatives what about children from lower ses or less highly educated families you are disproportionately hurting those kids the most
5404795 the achievement trap how america is failing millions of high achieving students from lower income families
5404796 there are far fewer lower income students achieving at the highest levels than there should be they disproportionately fall out of the high achieving group during elementary and high school they rarely rise into the ranks of high achievers during those periods and perhaps most disturbingly far too few ever graduate from college or go on to graduate school
5404797 unless something is done many more of americas brightest lower income students will meet this same educational fate robbing them of opportunity and our nation of a valuable resource
5404798 a big problem with nclb is its relatively narrow focus on kids at or above the proficient level
5404799 the accountability system is centered around that and in many cases that level is set pretty low it creates a big incentive for districts and schools to focus on those kids just below proficiency level but not necessarily on all low performing kids if you can move some of those kids just up and over you might just reach your target this doesnt put much pressure on kids in other parts of the distribution
5404800 but if you have limited resources thats where you have to concentrate
5404801 equity has to do with social justice and suggests that organizations should go beyond normal means to achieve a set of goals
5404802 nclb is designed to encourage educators to do what most would consider appropriate for schools that is teach all students this is not necessarily equity by definition
5404803 pushing students to reach their full capacity tapping into the multiple levels of knowledge and expertise they bring to the classroom
5404804 equity and excellence are certainly not dichotomous in my perspective they go hand in hand
5404805 does equity mean sameness do we want all our students to learn the same thing or do we want each child to reach his or her full potential
5404806 excellence versus equity is a false dichotomy can you have excellence without equity and whats equity without excellence
5404807 pisa suggests that maximising overall performance and securing similar levels of performance among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds can be achieved simultaneously
5404808 the results suggest therefore that quality and equity need not be considered as competing policy objectives
5404809 we are embarrassed to segregate them off and that reflects our culture more than anything else we are egalitarian
5404810 results showed that distinct ability patterns uncovered by age 13 portend contrasting forms of creative expression by middle age
5404811 whereas ability level contributes significantly to creative accomplishments ability tilt is critical for predicting the specific domain in which they occur
5404812 so you need to bring on more supply each year just to stay still

5404856 but please give me a freaking break mitt romney and i are at diametrically opposed ends of the republican scale
5404857 if i accepted mitt romneys endorsement and whatever pledged delegates he can provide what would that look like
5404858 it would look as though i agreed with all of the really disgustingly wingnut conservative stances romneys postured with in order to make himself appeal to the republican base i cant do that im a moderate it would completely compromise my integrity and if i dont have my integrity what am i just an old coot who cant take an electorates no for an answer so mitt thanks nice gesture and all that crap but no thanks

5404877 department spokesman jason bouzanis said salvia has been known to cause hallucinations out of body experiences unconsciousness and short term memory loss but thats not enough to declare it illegal
5404878 we cant make any recommendations to place salvia under the controlled drug and substances act schedules until we have sufficient scientific and empirical data that concludes it has the potential for misuse and abuse
5404879 as far as including salvia included under the controlled substances act thats health canadas responsibility
5404880 the rcmp is always concerned about any substance or product that may put the safety and security of canadians at risk
5404881 you wouldnt want to be driving a car or you wouldnt want to be on a balcony in a high building so the concern is that if individuals were to take a sufficient dose they might get themselves or others into trouble
5404882 the distribution is totally unregulated so unsuspecting teens or even children younger than teenage years might chance upon it and thats a recipe for disaster
5404883 salvia is so intense most people only try it once or twice

5404887 we make mistakes almost every single hand theyre small mistakes but maybe i could have gotten paid off a little more on a given hand or avoided a bluff
5404888 to become a pro or a really good player you have to become brutally objective about your game if you arent you wont make the changes and improvements you need
5404889 you have to be honest with yourself and you cant gloss over mistakes
5404890 but theres no need to beat yourself up you need to learn from the mistakes and move on

5404902 education corruption is among the most serious new problems in economic development today
5404903 although educational corruption existed under the soviet union we hypothesize that it was modest by comparison to the level today
5404904 it would constitute the educational equivalent in the european union of unilateral disarmament
5404905 it is difficult to imagine why a country or a university with a high reputation would allow its degrees to be made equivalent to those of a university or a university system with a reputation for corruption
5404906 by design one function of education is to purposefully teach the young how to behave in the future if the education system is corrupt one can expect future citizens to be corrupt as well this clearly must have a cost

5404928 the idea behind combining multiple graphics processors to increase performance is nothing new while you might be familiar with recent sli and crossfire solutions from modern day video card manufacturers nvidia and amd ati the birth of multi gpu 3d gaming can be traced back more than ten years ago to a company called 3dfx and their voodoo2 graphics chipset today we find nvidia and amd ati competing on a new graphics front combining a hybrid mix of integrated motherboard graphics chipset commonly found in low cost mainstream computer systems with that of a more traditional separate discrete graphics card

static analysis citing irrelevant results and false positives as key pain points but is there a more effective way to channel the energy required for good fuzzing in order to find more bugs faster this presentation will propose a series of techniques for customizing static rather than dynamic tools that will let you find more and better quality bugs than you ever thought possible we compare static and dynamic approaches to testing and look at the fundamental problems involved in fuzzing why static analysis is harder for humans to think about than fuzzing interfaces for customizing static analysis tools the kinds of bugs static analysis is good at finding why static analysis is both faster and more thorough then fuzzing where static analysis tools break down the talk concludes with the results of an experiment we conducted on open source code to compare the effectiveness of fuzzing and static analysis at finding a known set of security bugs

5405040 kingston has managed to not only survive in the cut throat world of dram production but to become one of the best memory technologies out there when we first saw kingston in our labs those many years ago back when ddr was king kingston memory really didnt impress us their yields were low overclocking was practically non existent and we had quite a few compatibility issues with some of their modules on a few boards come 2006 hyperx memory really made a name for itself with ddr2 modules overclocking to the 1200mhz level or 600mhz clock cycles this really got out blood pumping and even today kingston is used in a few tweaktown test beds thats just how well they have pulled themselves out of the dirt

5405043 though setup was definitely not as painless as the last product the performance compatibility and acceptable thermal performance of this unit makes it a winner in my book while its not something i would claim essential an item which could make your computing experience infinitely better i am saying that this unit is a good one to keep in mind especially if its on sale and lets face it the inclusion of avast anti virus home edition is a nice touch and should you ever drop this drive while its containing mission critical data the coupon for 200 off recovery from disk doctors will more than make up for the cost of the unit in short this product easily wins eagletech another approved award

5405049 overclocking each processor is different with five identical processors you will get five different results with this q9300 456x7 5 was the point at which it was prime95 stable it would run benchmarks at up to 470x7 5 but was nowhere near stable above 456 fsb the amount of voltage to keep the chip running was significantly more than what other 45nm processors i have tested have taken at similar fsb and raw clock speeds at 1 55 volts there was no point trying to even push further the good news is that the cpu would do almost 450 fsb on the stock 1 215 volts i left the volts at 1 34v during my testing just as a safeguard but have since lowered this to 1 31v at 456 fsb pretty low volts for the clock speeds i was able to pull from the little brother of the qx9770 having a motherboard that will allow high front side bus speeds with a quad core processor is essential with the q9300 cpu raw clock speed is limited because of the low 7 5 clock multiplier in order to reach 3 6ghz you would need to hit 480fsb something not all quad core cpus will do some but not all

5405076 standardized testing is simply a situation where all of the students being tested are taking the same test under the same or very similar testing conditions
5405077 the primary and most beneficial use of test data is to discover strengths and weaknesses of students and be able to take some sort of instructional action based on that
5405078 teachers look at the data in their own classroom to determine what standards their students have or have not met how to group kids according to what they have or have not done and to design lessons that will bring them up to the next level

5405128 the 1997 decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues from system 390 as 400 and rs 6000 servers
5405129 revenue from iseries servers declined in 2002 versus 2001 due to weak volumes across all product lines revenue from iseries servers also declined in 2001 versus 2000
5405130 this increase in revenue was more than offset by revenue declines for the midrange iseries servers and the zseries servers in 2000 as compared to 1999
5405131 the declines were driven by lower revenue from s 390 as 400 and rs 6000

5405147 we knew that children learn well with their moms or with a peer but we did not know if that was because they were getting feedback and help
5405148 in this study we just had the childrens mothers listen without providing any assistance weve found that by simply listening a mother helps her child learn
5405149 the basic idea is that it is really effective to try to get kids to explain things themselves instead of just telling them the answer
5405150 explaining their reasoning to a parent or perhaps to other people they know will help them understand the problem and apply what they have learned to other situations
5405151 we saw that this simple act of listening by mom made a difference in the quality of the childs explanations and how well they could solve more difficult problems later on
5405152 this is one of the first studies to examine whether or not explanation is useful in helping children under 8 apply what theyve learned to a modification of a task
5405153 we found that even 4 year olds can use explanation to help them learn and to apply what theyve learned to other tasks
5405154 this is so maddening the problem was hidden from view

5405335 youve got small teams focused on short development and less graphics people are passionate about the games even months after their release because its still new to the dev team
5405336 if one of my team members has a great idea that would be a load of fun i have to ask the big question which is plastered to the walls of our office how will this help epic
5405337 were stuck in a cycle of more and bigger weapons trying to compete with the other games on the market
5405338 women account for 70 of all pc based games of the 8 and under crowd nearly 100 of the us population is playing games tweens account for just 5 of the us population but 20 of the gaming market
5405339 compared to the us which has 88 of it population with broadband germany only has somewhere in the 30 percentile as this changes we see more growth for the gaming industry as well as tremendous potential for more women gamers which currently account for 37
5405340 the developers get really tired of the old match 3 games and the like but the germans love them they go crazy over the stuff and if you put a chicken in your game its bound to be a hit
5405341 you cant mimic success no matter how succesful nexon is we couldnt go out and produce a game that rivals world of warcraft youd spend too much time and money trying to replicate something that is already succesful but you can provide novelty the blair witch project is a great example from the film industry in which they didnt have the budget of a filmhouse so they took an entirely different approach
5405342 we want the people that would never pay for anything
5405343 when people are so closely tied to their avatars you dont need many of them to generate solid revenue
5405344 and by that i mean well torpedo anyone and anything that stands between me and the presidency even if it means sinking the ship of the democratic party
5405345 our main emergency backup plan now which i think is pretty self evident is to get the michigan and florida delegates seated that should help even things up a little
5405346 yes thats what makes the possible inclusion of michigan so delectably spicy
5405347 youd have to be a major loon l o o n a major loon not to want to count the results of an invalid election where your own candidate ran unopposed
5405348 we think the dnc should count votes for ron paul as votes for hillary clinton for example
5405349 after all people who support ron paul are basically throwing away their vote to protest against mccain romney huckabee and especially giuliani and hillary doesnt like those guys either
5405350 because hillary clinton is a great american that a lot of people idolize
5405351 leave fansubs to fans or do it for free yourselves all you are doing is getting rich off a series we helped make popular

5405358 scientists often look at the role of greenhouse gases in producing climate extremes
5405359 here we show the reverse is also true climate extremes can have a major effect on the amount of carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere
5405360 disruptions to natural carbon uptake can have enormous environmental and economic effects possibly even erasing efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions in a given year
5405361 carbontracker not only tells us when and where such disruptions occur but also suggests why
5405362 if it is important it will surface it will come again

5405368 the first bacterial genome was sequenced in 1995 and was followed by the landmark sequencing of the human genome in 2001 based on that trajectory voigt estimated that a synthetic human genome which could be used in human cloning research could be created by 2014
5405369 but before researchers can do that level of synthetic biology scientists will need to automate their methods beyond this work voigt said scientists will need programming tools in the same way computer scientists use higher level programming languages like fortran c and java to control computer function

5405396 i want to put on record that im not an old reprobate longing for a return of the good old days
5405397 we have heard of children as young as two and also women as old as 70 being raped
5405398 and i think it is a combination of rape and various forms of sexual harassment and there is a serious threat that if any official reporting that takes place that there will be reprisals against the women and against their children so you can understand that everyone is very reluctant to speak about it
5405399 it is very clear that the current situation is increasing the poverty level of many families who already are very poor and their coping mechanisms are getting extremely challenged
5405400 and you will find that children and families will basically do anything to survive and get what they need so in that context we are also concerned about an increased level of trafficking of children

5405628 if the govt is all about justice and not mercy then why does abortion matter
5405629 as for the justice mercy thing and the church overseeing mercy but the state overseeing justice thats very narrow reformed theology im having a hard time thinking kuiper stood by that view
5405630 thats not for all time just only for those people in that context
5405631 dont worry the government is here to take care of you
5405632 jesus hung out gays well ok what i meant was jesus might have hung out with gays
5405633 were christs miracles not performed to point to his lordship over all different aspects of life nature etc and to confirm his authority as gods son i think we can all agree to that
5405634 this the first of his miraculous signs jesus performed in cana of galilee he thus revealed his glory and his disciples put their faith in him
5405635 jesus performed this miracle so that the disciples would see his glory and then put their faith in him
5405636 the disciples put their faith in him after he performed this miracle and revealed his glory
5405637 because the tithe is not yours to begin with it is gods first and foremost icedawg said
5405638 after the church budgets the tithe for its primary purpose then what is left over plus what has been given as a free will offering is used for the care for the poor
5405639 im simply skeptical that government in itself is justified if it is it must only have limited functions that do not violate natural law
5405640 justice that does not discriminate between the worthy and unworthy is not true justice no matter what the aclu says mercy that does not discriminate between the deserving and the undeserving is not true mercy
5405641 if you go into your neighbors vineyard you may eat your fill of grapes as many as you wish but you shall not put any in your bag if you go into your neighbors standing grain you may pluck the ear with your hand but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbors standing grain
5405642 you are not required to contribute any of the surplus of your harvest to any government mandated charity if you cut it down with the sickle yourself
5405643 unless you dont like what hes going to do with it
5405644 my argument is that the bible gives us clear guidelines as to who is deserving of giving food etc
5405645 unless you dont like what hes going to do with it
5405646 i would actually use the text that you are quoting to support the opposite of your position
5405647 a person is able to draw his entire living from the earnings of others without having to do anything
5405648 paul tells the church that if people will not work they will not eat
5405649 didnt it the land belong to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasnt the money at your disposal
5405650 i got my welfare stats from the national council of welfare in their august 2006 report
5405651 sorry if my stats to measure up to your qualifications but thats the number thats out there regardless of all the disclaimers you make even half of them is a significant amount
5405652 so if you think this view is wrong articulate your alternative based on a biblical model that deals with taking care of the poor and needy
5405653 government based social assistance is a fairly recent invention as compared to the entirety of history so did god not have a mechanism for taking care of the poor before then
5405654 nothing works for you does it stats dont work scripture doesnt work either

5405661 my colleague will place your bags in the storage room allow me to show you to our lounge bar there will be no charge for your drinks of course
5405662 he was also wondering whether something could be done about the heat in his room he says its too warm and the thermostat doesnt seem to work

5405682 i guess you could if you had a lot of hydrogen run your engine completely without any other modification
5405683 we did not make any modifications to this car that means anybody who had a diesel car could just pure this stuff into the gas tank and it would run fine
5405684 yes youre right of course in a twenty minute segment after commercials mythbusters should have mentioned a 25 year old device that was illegal and is no longer available because it increased fuel efficiency by 3 to 20
5405685 if fuel economy were the only factor you could increase it in all cars today by re programming the cars computer to make the combustion chamber run a little hotter but manufacturers cant do that because it would increase the nox emissions to illegal levels
5405686 notice also that only five fuel saving devices have been tested in the past 10 years one of which was submitted by the ftc for testing instead of the manufacturer
5405687 if they did real tests instead of picking devices with crazy promises

5405704 crediamo che i parchi siano una componente fondamentale per lavvenire del paese e abbiano alte finalit e peculiarit che li distinguono dagli altri enti pubblici non economici il dibattito sul ruolo di queste istituzioni che sono vitali per la capacit di coniugare protezione della natura e sviluppo socio economico del territorio non pu fermarsi a una discussione su tagli e riduzioni di budget e risorse decisi aprioristicamente

5405710 it is disconcerting for us to discover that our cells arent well honed efficient machines dedicated to making just the important stuff of us but rather are carting around massive quantities of useless bric a brac and debris which brings us back to the fugu its genome is a tiny 365 million bases one eighth the size of the human genome and the fugu genes take up a full third of that sequence rather than 5 percent while the repetitive dna has been reduced to a sixth of the total rather than 45 percent yet fugu arent missing anything and are as sophisticated and complex on the cellular tissue and organismal level as other vertebrates whats the source of the difference

5405819 one of my pet peeves is that weve been dealing with 19th century transit technology we can do better than lrt we can have ultra light elevated transit systems personal rapid transit with lightweight vehicles because the vehicles are lighter the system will use less energy i used to be a prt skeptic but now the technology is there it wont be easy to develop prt technology and get all the kinks out but it is doable if you think about what youd want from the ideal transit technology its prt a stations right where you are within walking distance b no waiting
5405820 the social perception of public transportation depends on the quality of the transportation i think we may be looking to technological advances in public transportation to create new kinds of personal rapid transit we had a big breakthrough announced only a week ago that a british system called literally prt personal rapid transit is going to be adapted for heathrow airport progressively over the next ten years and when you drive your car into heathrow to one of the parking lots you will get your own personal vehicle and program it to go to your terminal or vice versa and if this is as successful as i think it will be this could be a big breakthrough in developing new kinds of totally personalized rapid transit which could transform our cities in ways that we cant yet see

5405828 it is also the first interagency which is a broadly conceived activity designed to provide accurate unbiased and policy relevant scientific information concerning the carbon cycle to a broad range of stakeholders it provides a baseline characterization of the north american carbon budget upon which future research and reports can build and refine

5406050 i think my daughter loves caylee so much that she will do whatever it takes to protect her
5406051 in her own way she has those reasons inside her why shes protecting her and we dont understand those right now
5406052 unfortunately i cant disclose that at this time based on my conversations with her i can understand what shes going through and basically the reason why she did what she did there is an explanation for all of this unfortunately im not at liberty to say at the time
5406053 obviously when shes away from where shes supposed to be we all fear for her safety
5406054 she needs to be back home with her family with the people who love her and thats really our ultimate goal here to have her home and to be with the people who love her
5406055 i think that was a huge mistake by arresting her that quickly because she was not able to today casey anthony with her daughter caylee now missing reach out to her friends and her family to maybe shed some light on the reasons
5406056 for not telling me sooner for not telling the police sooner
5406057 someone cant come to grips until theyre forgiven shes probably not going to be able to tell me everything until i can forgive her

5406103 contemporary christianity is guilty of the error of the pharisees
5406104 traditions that have suppressed the living breathing functional headship of jesus christ in his church
5406105 the great bulk of first century practices have been removed from the christian landscape
5406106 who have taken the terrifying step of leaving the safe camp of institutional christianity
5406107 where do we find our practices for the christian life where is our model for understanding what a christian is in the first place is it not found in the life of jesus christ as portrayed in the new testament or do we borrow it from somewhere else perhaps a pagan philosopher
5406108 in the new testament we have the genesis of the church
5406109 organic churches are characterized by spirit led open participatory meetings and nonhierarchical leadership
5406110 that the church in its contemporary institutional form has neither a biblical nor a historical right to function as it does
5406111 this is not a work for scholars so it is by no means exhaustive
5406112 one of the main theses is that what passes for a
5406113 to do justice to love mercy and to walk humbly with my god
5406114 you believe that the bible is an enigma and that christians are left without any certainty any knowledge any understanding or any wisdom
5406115 its totally unacceptable and its unfortunate that our young teenagers feel this way we need to take action we need to help our young people realize that this is not appropriate behaviour
5406116 you just hear jokes being yelled out all the time that have to do with girls doing sexual things
5406117 theres a lot of groping and touching in our school
5406118 one of the concerns is the alarming rate of gender based violence and 21 per cent of the students that were surveyed said that they knew at least one student who was sexually assaulted at school
5406119 twenty nine per cent of grade 9 girls felt unsafe at school partly due to sexual comments and unwanted looks or touches 27 per cent of the girls in grade 11 admitted to being pressured into doing something sexual that they did not want to do 14 per cent of the females reported being harassed over the internet
5406120 they take it for granted that this is the way they should be treated
5406121 sexual assault from the perspective of the development of a young girl is any unwanted sexual touching or name calling
5406122 our first task is to talk to a lot of experts in the field and get some recommendations
5406123 here we sit in february 2008 and were still talking about doing more studies
5406124 were looking at ways of having more gender specific programs that particularly focus on young girls and programs that focus on boys and what is appropriate behaviour
5406125 we also have set up what we call the student safety line we have e s p empowering student partnerships in all of our schools and they can use the crime stoppers or kids help phone

5406129 cant help being cynical even about holiday charity the seasonal giving of gifts among relatives contrasts with the locks and guns with which people guard their personal assets the rest of the year
5406130 far from being an esoteric and speculative distraction our beliefs about the end toward which things are moving profoundly and practically shape our present behavior this is especially true in regard to violence and war and is one of the reasons many of us have been increasingly critical in recent years of popular american eschatology in general and conventional views of hell in particular simply put if we believe that god will ultimately enforce his will by forceful domination and will eternally torture all who resist that domination then torture and domination become not only permissible but in some way godly
5406131 it turned away from meaning that is fixed and universal and turned toward meaning that is
5406132 evil is badness at a deep level one that we intuitively feel demands reparations and penalties because if offends against an inviolable norm it is always wrong it is not only wrong to me it is wrong everywhere
5406133 in the absence of a compelling external authority that enables us to draw the line confidently between right and wrong true and false we are left to fumble about with only our feelings to guide us
5406134 you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your father in heaven he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous if you love those who love you what reward will you get are not even the tax collectors doing that and if ou greet only your brothers what are you doing more than others be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect

5406147 the celebrity fan ratio was extremely difficult to measure accurately
5406148 due to the extraordinarily rapid influx of new celebrities and the extremely rapid rate at which loyalties are formed and dissolved among a celebritys fan base also due to the somewhat stupid trend forecast by warhol many fans find it difficult to focus on more than one celebrity at a time
5406149 fans tend to be fiercely loyal to a given celebrity for a period ranging from thirty seconds up to four days
5406150 at that point either the celebrity is deposed by a new bigger brighter celebrity or the fans attention span is simply unable to sustain further interest either way the fan moves on and the celebrity is left out in the cold this is also part of the reason we believe behind the dangerous rates of anti depressant use among celebrities and former celebrities like for example dr townsend over there just believe in yourself phil every cloud has a silver lining

5406158 what i thought was just some tiny white haired crone in a giant boat of a 1973 chrysler debobo
5406159 but then this debobo weaved its way straight out from the curb cutting me off the driver seemed to have no idea that there were lanes painted on the road which doesnt surprise me since her head was about a foot below the steering wheel right blinker going the whole time she was all over the place
5406160 you can bet my window was rolled down and a giant middle finger aimed straight up at that driver when i gunned the engine and charged by
5406161 damn it felt good righteous retribution but imagine how i felt when i saw that little white head poke up and i was staring right at nana shes 93 and we always tell everyone how cool it is that she still gets around on her own better than being in a home or at my moms house being a burden on the family and all that crap but damn did she look pissed especially with those giant magnifying eyeglass lenses im so not looking forward to thanksgiving

5406166 the health of americas tidal creeks provides an early warning of the effects of coastal development on both coastal ecosystems and potential human health and well being
5406167 multi vessel coronary disease pci surgery or maybe both are wrong
5406168 pci has evolved a lot and continues to evolve from standard balloon angioplasty to bms to des and now to newer forms of des
5406169 it provides a new way forward for patients especially older patients and those with more complex disease by lowering the risk of recurrence and offering a tremendous reprieve from their symptoms
5406170 a great option thats associated with fewer symptoms and a higher quality of life
5406171 when a patient is a candidate for both pci and bypass surgery i think it makes sense to offer the less invasive pci as the first line of defense
5406172 its not fair to recommend pci for a patient and say you can always have surgery later if this doesnt work the public gets the idea that surgery and pci are equivalent which isnt true for patients with three vessel disease for whom surgery is life prolonging compared to pci
5406173 proponents of pci are basically saying we never said it would save anybodys life we just wanted to improve their symptoms and they should acknowledge that this is the case when they discuss options with patients who have life threatening coronary disease
5406174 the drug eluting stent is every bit as good as bypass surgery for treating multi vessel disease
5406175 the rise of angioplasty procedures has leveled off and appears to be on the decline
5406176 the risk of stroke associated with cabg is about 10 times that associated with pci and strokes occur very rarely as a result of pci
5406177 the advantage of surgery is that its definitive its durable and evidence shows that in almost all cases it is effective
5406178 cabg completely bypasses the disease and in many cases it simply doesnt come back
5406179 cabg certainly offers the best long term solution for some people the more severe the disease and the more vessels are involved the more appropriate surgery becomes
5406180 in those cases its the doctors responsibility to make sure those patients understand the potential benefits and risks of the procedure theyre being offered
5406181 regardless of anything else patients have done medical treatment should be the standard of good medical therapy and the first option we offer our patients
5406182 the duke data 6 show that patients who are on multiple effective treatments which can be a first rate aspirin beta blocker and statin available for four bucks a month from wal mart have about a twofold reduction in their risk of death compared to patients who do not adhere to their medication regimens
5406183 the issue is that the real benefit is in medical therapy
5406184 pci doesnt prolong survival in most patients so youre not losing anything there by going with medical management and cabg obviously has a higher risk than medical treatment
5406185 if we cardiologists could just do our jobs in our own treatment environment and give patients simple four dollar a month plans we would save literally thousands of lives
5406186 we need to give patients the important treatments first and if those fail then try the expensive and risky treatments
5406187 advances in medical therapy have led to more promising results than anticipated in treating patients with one and two vessel disease whom the courage trial 7 showed arent being helped as much with pci
5406188 many doctors tell their patients youve got bad blockages and we need to bypass or dilate those blockages because if we dont youre going to have a heart attack or die
5406189 and thats simply not validated by the randomized trials its not true but its something we frequently tell our patients because it avoids a much longer discussion about whats really going on in terms of the risks versus the benefits of these various interventions
5406190 surgery has risks like pain infection and recovery time that people understand up front
5406191 but multi vessel coronary disease patients should understand that pcis ongoing cumulative risk of restenosis is less obvious with studies showing that surgery compares more favorably to pci the longer patients are followed
5406192 its only natural for patients to think that if they have a stent placed or undergo a bypass that their disease is fixed and doctors can easily get away with saying its lucky we found this blockage now we can fix it
5406193 a doctor who offers patients a potentially risky procedure must be able to show that its likely to help them
5406194 most multi vessel cad studies have in fact looked only at patients with two vessel disease not three or four vessel disease and the distinctions are critical in terms of both compromised patient health and the interpretation of the data
5406195 people can take these results to mean what they want them to mean when making a case for or against a particular therapy
5406196 its one thing for doctors to advocate for the procedures they do but it can be an entirely different thing for them to advocate for their patients
5406197 we should help our patients develop a perspective beyond what happens today present them with information honestly and never present a procedure as an option when another one would be more appropriate
5406198 lets have the courage to tell our patients the truth about what we know about each of these treatment strategies and take the time to explain all of the risks and benefits
5406199 im an idiot i already have too much on my plate theres no way im going to get to this

5406304 i have found through the years during the times when ive been here in indiana that almost every direction i look and so many faces i see immediately cause a picture to be formed of an event a happening in my life that i remember well
5406305 i think the main thing that has kept indiana so close to my heart is the fact that indiana has been and still is the headquarters of mr
5406306 ive settled down three thousand miles from indiana ive traveled to points in the world three times that distance at times ive stayed away several years at a stretch but i somehow have never felt that i was very far from here somehow i dont feel that i have ever been away

5406323 let the government get out of the way of the productive energies of all groups in the population rich middle class and poor alike and the result will be an enormous increase in the welfare and the standard of living of everyone and most particular of the poor who are the ones supposedly helped by the miscalled welfare state

5406333 to respond to and begin addressing complaints about nudity or pornography harassment or unwelcome contact within 24 hours
5406334 i applaud facebook for addressing my offices concerns about the sites representation that they provided a safe environment and an expeditious complaint review process
5406335 i believe our agreement will provide additional confidence to young people and parents alike and give facebook a competitive advantage in the marketplace for setting a new standard for safety
5406336 privacy and safety have been a priority since we first built facebook
5406337 our agreement with attorney general cuomo will set new industry standards to stop abuse online
5406338 we applaud the attorney generals leadership and are committed to working together to keep facebook safe
5406339 any site that relies on user generated content whether its a small blog or a social networking giant needs a prominent complaint mechanism that doesnt just help users it also helps to channel complaints in a way that make them manageable im amazed that facebook didnt have that already
5406340 its even more important for a site thats targeting children as well as adults
5406341 intended solely for users who are thirteen 13 years of age or older
5406342 if facebook had had obvious complaint systems like youtube flickr and myspace it might have avoided the attorney generals action its now stuck with onerous demands to address complaints within 24 hours and to report on steps taken within 72 hours other sites will surely fear these time limits becoming the industry standard

5406360 human trafficking exists everywhere in the world in all societies there are no exceptions
5406361 its almost certainly one of the fastest growing crimes in our globalised world
5406362 it is above all big business the un estimates that the global market value is in billions of dollars and that is one of the most cautious estimates
5406363 which uses seven transport containers to illustrate the brutal and harrowing experiences of women sold into the sex trade
5406364 it really is a global phenomenon almost everyone of us has encountered victims of human trafficking in one way or another even if we dont know it

5406403 scientists have found the genes of an organism fused wholesale into the genome of an entirely separate species raising new questions over how evolution works the discovery suggests that simple bacteria and animals might swap entire genes more often than previously thought such large scale transfer of genes would allow species to acquire entirely new functions and abilities in a very short space of time rather than the much slower sequence of random mutations that normally evolves species over several generations

5406415 how problematic to have both a body and a mind for the former stands in almost monstrous contrast to the latters dignity and intelligence our bodies smell ache sag pulse throb and age they force us to fart and burp and to abandon sensible plans in order to lie in bed with people sweating and letting out intense sounds reminiscent of hyenas calling out to one another across the barren wastes our bodies hold our minds hostage to their whims and rhythms our whole perspective on life can be altered by the digestion of a heavy lunch

5406418 a lack of quill knobs does not necessarily mean that a dinosaur did not have feathers
5406419 finding quill knobs on velociraptor though means that it definitely had feathers
5406420 i wonder why the knobs are not visible on the other specimens
5406421 such calculations can accurately predict the top speed of a six tonne chicken but dinosaurs are not built like chickens nor do they run like them
5406422 we are the only people to have tried this on dinosaurs
5406423 the figures we have produced are the best estimate to date as to how fast these prehistoric animals could run
5406424 their method seems to work poorly for a small chicken sized dinosaur
5406425 haha you want the game but we wont release it

5406435 mike huckabee incurred my divine displeasure through his constant invocation of my name and my glory in the pursuit of a self aggrandizing political agenda
5406436 i am frankly sick unto death of microscopic human beings whom i might remind you i created like that
5406437 glomming onto me in the hope that some of my divinity might somehow rub off on them pretending they have some insight into my divine intentions implying they speak in my name get real of all the candidates in the current mortal circus huckabee is by far the worst he was simply begging for a smiting
5406438 i remember moving the warm and cold fronts into position to create the conditions that would form the tornado

5406445 aggression occurs among virtually all vertebrates and is necessary to get and keep important resources such as mates territory and food
5406446 we have found that the reward pathway in the brain becomes engaged in response to an aggressive event and that dopamine is involved
5406447 it is well known that dopamine is produced in response to rewarding stimuli such as food sex and drugs of abuse
5406448 what we have now found is that it also serves as positive reinforcement for aggression
5406449 we learned from these experiments that an individual will intentionally seek out an aggressive encounter solely because they experience a rewarding sensation from it
5406450 this shows for the first time that aggression on its own is motivating and that the well known positive reinforcer dopamine plays a critical role
5406451 in real ways were becoming more like a third world country

5406461 we should quickly consider how to appropriately give the fed the authority to access necessary information from highly complex financial institutions and the responsibility to intervene in order to protect the system
5406462 so they can carry out the role our nation has come to expect
5406463 it was very well documented which allows us to create a faithful replica

5406468 the positioning of the jet stream from southwest texas to northeast michigan with readily available moisture streaming inland from the gulf created conditions favorable for tornado activity in the countrys mid section

5406470 when severe weather is forecast people should stay on top of developments closely

5406472 drug use wrecks lives and blights communities through the tough choices offered to offenders via the drug interventions programme we now have 1 000 drugs users a week accessing treatment and drug fuelled acquisitive crime that blights communities across the country has fallen by a fifth
5406473 we have not only helped individuals and their families but also improved the quality of life in the communities that suffer from the criminal and anti social behaviour linked to drug use
5406474 this would not have been achieved without the sterling efforts of those drug treatment professionals the police and other delivery partners who work at the front line combating the harms of drug misuse
5406475 if he suddenly decided to practice civil disobedience ala gandhi a steady diet of redbull and ginseng couldnt energize me enough to openly criticize what i feel to be ludacris questionable career choices especially when there are a plethora of more deserving monosyllabic rappers out there who i can target
5406476 in terms of his late night conquests and a vivid story about him blowing a mobsters cerebral cortex all over some random city street its just my opinion that mcs have to be more responsible when broaching the the topic of obama from now until the election
5406477 black leader who he has never met someone intimately linking the two gentleman why in the fuck would ludacris say that say that his music is in obamas ipod
5406478 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
5406479 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
5406480 a solitary voice easily drowned out by millions of other people who express themselves in blog entries

5406998 regulators have agreed in principle to allow human animal embryos to be created and used for research
5406999 but scientists wanting to use hybrids will still need to make individual applications the human fertilisation and embryology authority said
5407000 scientists want to create hybrid embryos by merging human cells with animal eggs in a bid to extract stem cells the embryos would then be destroyed within 14 days
5407001 the cells form the basic building blocks of the body and have the potential to become any tissue making them essential for research

5407006 it is very clear that visible and invisible hands are controlling prices in a fake way with political and economic aims
5407007 as you know the decrease in the dollars value and the increase in energy prices are two sides of the same coin which are being introduced as factors behind the recent instability
5407008 i repeat my suggestion made six months ago at the opec summit in riyadh to create a basket of credible currencies which would be the basis for oil transactions or alternatively that opec countries create a new currency for their transactions

5407010 the rise in consumption is lower than the rise in production

5407025 its like im looking in a mirror only i have to hand it to him i never really had the kind of massive crowd appeal obama does
5407026 i was more of a stealth movement if barack had been alive two millenia ago id probably have found myself playing second fiddle as a disciple
5407027 we cant say john mccains the absolutely ideal apocalyptic candidate for all of us

5407074 i guess you could say that ive never been very strong in standardized tests
5407075 i decided to move back home so that i could enroll in the masters program at cleveland state university which was much less expensive and where i was also able to qualify for a stipend
5407076 three cleveland clinic researchers met with the masters students and i called all three of them
5407077 i wasnt accepted but every year the school tells 10 applicants that they can come to the school and take some of the physiology and microbiology courses offered in the first year of medical school
5407078 to find out if applicants can really make the grade in medical school
5407079 all the special status students again apply to the school same as other applicants with the only difference being that i was now physically in toledo
5407080 i was wait listed i waited through the rest of may june and july and then in august i got accepted

5407092 i guess i would ask you all to answer a question how much drinking is too much on any one occasion our society has great difficulty giving anyone a clear answer on that

5407116 first of course we need to create a viable embryo using self replicating cells from the original ms spears
5407117 it took almost four months to make the cells do anything but sit around and mope and occasionally slink off to the detox wing of the petri dish but were making good progress now
5407118 once the organism has reached britney spears version is current age well thin out the mixture and begin to transition the product over to traditional britney food such as whoppers tacos and twinkies

5407146 we lost one of the great ones today tim russert exemplified what is best about journalism he was fair he was hard hitting he was informed and he came at his tasks with a smile a sense of joy and humor that urged us all toward comity and cooperation he was a giant in the news business as pillar of the washington scene a terrific sports fan and family man and a genuinely good person who will be missed

5407155 forced marriage leads to victims suffering years of physical and mental abuse and in extreme cases unlawful imprisonment and rape
5407156 that is why we are raising the age limit for visas checking anyone entering into a marriage does so of their own free will and demanding that those coming to the uk learn english
5407157 british citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose but we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common that means freedom not being forced to marry someone and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of english with consequences for those who break the rules

5407161 in this way the dialog between original and copy represents an homage to the authors and the originality of the copy shows how inspiring reading such as this can be
5407162 god forbid that any of our critical national infrastructure runs on this product
5407163 oracle has ignored researchers and also attacked them saying that researchers are the problem
5407164 the problem is oracles flawed software and oracles amateur handling of security related issues
5407165 what i really want is a world where there can be fair and accurate criticism
5407166 im all for dialogue but you have to establish trust
5407167 once a month going forward well provide them with a list of everything that has not yet been fixed and indicate whether its still under investigation or whether its been fixed
5407168 another thing that struck me was the amount of effort and time that it must have taken to get a lumbering stegosaurus of a beast like oracle to turn around
5407169 microsoft had to go with the hacker love fest model because theyre a big target
5407170 for at least 12 years we have built security into the formal development process
5407171 they said recently that they will change the way they communicate with researchers giving more feedback information but nothing has happened yet
5407172 right now the only feedback you get is the day before a patch is released they tell you your bug is going to be patched and nothing else
5407173 were in a nervous state but we think its manageable risk
5407174 if we were to pursue an oracle environment where we invited direct connectivity from outside partners we would reconsider our security posture
5407175 as oracle becomes more pervasive they should absolutely explore a relationship with the so called white hat hackers
5407176 the people that are willing to sit down with them at the table are one of their only defences against the people who will not sit down with them at the table
5407177 this is just a myth that oracle is in the back end of nowhere protected by all these firewalls
5407178 there are laboratory studies that show treatments are very effective with youth who have mental health concerns but when we look in the real treatment world we are hard pressed to identify services that are effective
5407179 the ptpb offers a revolutionary opportunity to improve mental health services mental health professionals need to know if they are succeeding during treatment and if they are not they need to know what to change the ptpb gives them that information
5407180 what were trying to do is use measures other than pathology to look at progress so we examine the factors that are common to any treatment situation
5407181 theyre less likely to keep appointments and more likely to drop out of treatment some of these treatments require cooperation from the family treatment is less likely to be helpful if there is not a good relationship between the caregiver and the therapist we think caregivers are an integral part of the team and need to be involved in the youths treatment
5407182 if the therapist thinks treatment is going great and the teen thinks its going terribly then the therapist is probably not going to be very helpful to that youth
5407183 the therapist needs to collect systematic feedback concurrent with treatment
5407184 the ptpb will provide feedback that is hard to disregard and will also insert some accountability for producing results into the mental health system
5407185 providers of childrens mental health services have long expressed their frustration to the research community at the lack of a comprehensive feasible and scientifically developed set of measures for assessing process and outcome existing measures have been too time consuming too limited in the domains and perspectives assessed too costly or insufficient with regard to scientific validity
5407186 the ptpb is the first comprehensive set of measures that can be used routinely to assess process and outcomes of treatment services across multiple domains and perspectives and it meets the highest level of scientific rigor this is a landmark contribution to childrens mental health services and research
5407187 thanks to providence were in 12 different states and almost 40 different locations
5407188 our clinicians are getting information they are able to use to inform and enhance treatment
5407189 this needs the strong support of the institution going into it because cfit adds significant new responsibilities for the organization especially supervisors and therapists we knew there was not much time for data collection so we focused on developing short and brief measures but short and valid measures are difficult to develop it was also important that we develop weekly feedback reports that were useful
5407190 the feedback reports give me insight into the kids im working with
5407191 we had the child screened and he was admitted into the hospital for two weeks and placed on medications now the child keeps a journal and talks with me openly the foster parent has a different outlook too and doesnt think the child is being manipulative im very thankful for cfit it led me in a different direction
5407192 in recent months we have listened to people across britain and the message is clear they want those who want to make britain their home to speak english to work hard and to earn the right to stay here
5407193 we are making the biggest changes to our immigration system for a generation and part of that is making sure those who stay in the uk make a positive impact on their local community
5407194 britain is not anti foreigner were a welcoming tolerant place but we do expect newcomers to sign up to a deal if they want to stay and build a life in britain
5407195 the public overwhelmingly supports the idea of newcomers earning their right to stay today we show how well make these ideas law hand in hand with our new points system for selective migration like the one thats worked so well in australia

5407258 current vlcds very low calorie diets are generally safe when used under proper medical supervision in moderately and severely obese patients body mass index weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared gt 30 and are usually effective in promoting significant short term weight loss with concomitant improvement in obesity related conditions long term maintenance of weight lost with vlcds is not very satisfactory and is no better than with other forms of obesity treatment incorporation of behavioral therapy and physical activity in vlcd treatment programs seems to improve maintenance
5407259 say a rather muscular large framed woman like myself i have an estimated lean mass of approximately 135 pounds
5407260 which is to say i am extremely weight loss resistant
5407261 and last i checked folks stall on low carb plans that are higher in calories as well
5407262 the metabolic situation in extremely low calorie diets may be comparable to that in starvation an attempt is made to explain our observation concerning the induction of a diabetic state during such diets on the basis of increased insulin resistance in states of starvation and anorexia nervosa with a concomitant role in stress hormones
5407263 current vlcds are generally safe when used under proper medical supervision in moderately and severely obese patients body mass index weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared gt

5407265 two negative ratings disruption of normal social eating and thinking about food and wanting to eat increased after 2mo of the vlcd these data are consistent with the suggestion that there is a fatiguing effect after 8 weeks 49 of a vlcd making adherence more difficult

5407268 in fact they the parents in the case under investigation were home schooled at home where else would you home school these men are geniuses by parents not qualified to teach the kids in subjects appropriate to their age and grade level
5407269 the courts decision means that home schoolers must be given some substantive instruction in social studies and not simply spend their time watching fox with its strange assortment of oddballs pontificating on current events
5407270 on the other hand there is a formidable cottage industry run by conservative evangelicals that provides suitable materials for home schoolers
5407271 its evident that the vast majority who teach their offspring in front of the television do so because they dont want their children to be subjected to such dangerous doctrines as evolution abortion global warming equal rights and other ideas abhorrent to the evangelical mantra

5407276 we already have some of the toughest sex offences legislation in the world but we are determined to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable at home and abroad
5407277 from 14 july anyone who commits an offence against children abroad will face the prospect of prosecution for the same offence here even though it may not have been offence in that country
5407278 as a result i hope this new law will send a tough message to deter travelling sex tourists
5407279 the sexual abuse of children is the worst crime imaginable
5407280 this measure is a significant step forward and sends out a very clear and unequivocal message to offenders everywhere and no matter whether they are in the uk or abroad we will track you we will bring you to account and you will face the consequences of your criminal actions every child no matter where they live deserves that protection

5407297 penguin days are a fantastic opportunity to get together with a wide variety of people and understand more about the issues that surround open source unlike a lot of conference gatherings the emphasis in these is on meeting people and making connections that you carry out of them room and that works
5407298 now on to penguin day wow for my part i was impressed by the international scope of the audience folks from great britain canada kenya turkey ghana chicago and all points in between the energy was great and the range of topics on the agenda meant there was something for everyone suffice it to say penguin day set the mark against which all other events will be measured in my mind

5407370 they are used to having a lot of their own stuff and they kind of expect to bring that personalization to college
5407371 these kids really have the tools to express themselves and create their own style
5407372 college students have money to spend and stores are going all out they have wandered into a gold mine
5407373 we only have one desk and everything i have has to fit into it
5407374 they have more of a challenge because they have more stuff and they want to bring it all

5407380 who can tell me why estonia was so successful in making the transition to a market economy
5407381 because they moved so quickly to let in foreign trade
5407382 okaaaay but why would the estonians do a crazy thing like that
5407383 you think living in the shadow of russia is a good thing
5407384 the estonians lived in a centrally planned economy for 30 years
5407385 and we all know that in a centrally planned economy no one is hard working
5407386 the professors had been trained in russia the reading was mao zedong thought and das kapital
5407387 i thought wow this is the best book ive ever read
5407388 china was still a planned economy so we didnt see much need to worry about demand or profits or accounting the main task was maximizing production
5407389 i especially like his explanation of how rational people think on the margin
5407390 have phenomenal technical skills definitely on a par with the students i teach at mit
5407391 these kids can show you four different ways to develop the black scholes equations you can throw almost anything at them and they just pick it up
5407392 i need a clearer understanding of how people on the mainland think
5407393 chinese companies cant attract the best minds from tsinghua will any of these students be president of china can they be the next generations hu jintao

5407398 believed that language contained a virus which could be exposed even enhanced by cutting up rearranging narrative
5407399 i have said repeatedly that there is no hiding place for those that come to britain and break our rules which is why already this year weve rid the country of over 2 400 foreign lawbreakers
5407400 in january i set the uk border agency the tough target of removing 5 000 foreign criminals by the end of the year an increase on last years record breaking levels i am pleased that we are on track to meet this target
5407401 i promised the biggest shake up of border security for a generation and already we are beginning to see the results
5407402 thousands of illegal migrants have been barred from entering britain while millions of pounds worth of dangerous drugs have been removed from our streets
5407403 and there are more changes still to come alongside the fingerprinting of all visa applicants the introduction later this year of id cards for foreign nationals will allow us to lock people to one identity by the end of the year the introduction of one of the most advanced electronic borders systems in the world will allow us to count people in and out of the country

5407409 taking over for tracy is going to be tough because those are big shoes to fill
5407410 but with his help and help from the guys on the team the transition should be pretty smooth
5407411 hes going to be a great leader for that program
5407412 what a lovely thing to say did you hear that
5407413 i already had a thing for the ariels when i arrived they have red hair and i love red hair
5407414 we are determined to keep our streets safe taking knives off the streets dealing with wider issues of youth crime the continuing challenges of drugs and organised crime and of course the fight against terrorism
5407415 but we should not lose sight of the fact that over the last decade overall crime is down by a third thanks in large part to the hard work dedication and courage of the police with over 10 000 more officers in addition to new community support officers and every area of the country since april now having its own neighbourhood police team
5407416 todays proposals will cut red tape and top down targets freeing the police to focus on the most serious crime and on local issues
5407417 this is a vital part of this governments commitment to build a fairer safer britain
5407418 our green paper is setting out a new deal for the public and the police
5407419 i want to help the police to continue to cut crime drive up confidence and deliver for the public todays plans give greater freedom for the police matched by more power to the public
5407420 i was both surprised and flattered to be invited to undertake this important new role which having given careful consideration to am pleased to accept

5407422 we made a big move two weeks ago and have inserted ourselves in the race for a mens team qualification to the college national finals in casper wyoming
5407423 what is big about the team win is that it was the first team win for njc since 1999
5407424 these guys and girls have all the talent in the world i would match them against any team in this region in head to head competition
5407425 if you count all these individual event championships up the njc rodeo team has won every event at least once except the saddle bronc riding
5407426 all these points weve accumulated translate to a second place position in the regional standings and a great shot at qualifying for the cnfr as a team

5407429 foodnetwork com experienced technical difficulties last night as our viewers have seen on this season many twists and turns have taken place during the show
5407430 approximately half the sample is in the metropolitan nashville public schools
5407431 one quarter of the sample is in richmond va and the other quarter is in minneapolis
5407432 managing behavior is always rated highly as a top concern of teachers
5407433 we know from the literature that adults are impacted by child behavior the natural reaction is to want them out
5407434 we do know that a significant portion of students with these behaviors receive free or reduced price lunch
5407435 generally speaking these students come ill prepared for school and schools are ill equipped to deal with them
5407436 our suspicion is that a lot of it has to do with teacher preparation that teachers have not been exposed to methods or techniques that would help them manage these childrens behavior or teachers are inadvertently shaped out of quality instruction with these children it becomes such a chore to interact with them that they sometimes ignore or overreact to their behavior
5407437 our intervention shifts the focus were focusing on teachers and giving teachers tools weve taken a number of components that we have either demonstrated or have evidence for and put together a package of behavior supports
5407438 they are there to support the teachers many teachers who deal with these children feel isolated
5407439 we know there is a strong relationship between academic achievement and behavior problems and this shows up particularly in reading
5407440 were using a direct instruction program called horizons its very scripted and very engaging and requires lots of responding by children
5407441 if you dont keep them engaged school becomes very difficult for these children as they get older
5407442 were seeing significantly higher levels of praise more opportunities to respond lower levels of reprimands and higher levels of child engagement
5407443 first can we get teachers to continue these new techniques without ongoing support were going to be testing that this year and second are there certain types of children who respond better to this classroom based approach than others
5407444 our research has suggested that the environment may be part of the issue
5407445 focusing primarily on the child is like fixing one small part when the whole engine really needs a tune up once you eliminate the basics then you can look specifically at certain components questions like is it genetic is it cognitive i dont want to ask those questions until im sure that everything i can control in the environment is geared toward these children being successful

5407462 as sps continue to roll out dpi solutions and applications they would like to know the efficacy of their dpi solutions
5407463 sps also need to make sure if the dpi tools work according to specifications as well as applications parameters
5407464 dpi test equipment cannot test services or devices in isolation because that would mean that they are dealing with just one type of traffic
5407465 in order to really test the service vendors have to simulate multiple types of traffic that truly reflect the real subscriber or network environment and have to perform other services simultaneously in the same environment

5407496 the most effective way to clean up marine debris is to keep it out of the water in the first place
5407497 by educating the public on and around the water we keep dangerous debris in its place and out of the water

5407521 they basically told us there wasnt anything they could do for gordon
5407522 i looked up dukes outcomes online and they were the best so i put gordon and my daughter in the car and we drove to north carolina
5407523 shauna drove straight through 13 hours and at one point we had to pull off of i 95 in the middle of washington dc because i was so sick shauna had no idea what was happening to me
5407524 you just sit around a lot more than you used to
5407525 i basically appeared to them out of nowhere essentially waltzed in off the street totally unannounced
5407526 but they immediately took me in and started rooting for me
5407527 i remember that the whole transplant team gathered around gordons bed
5407528 i was so sure they were coming to tell us that they couldnt do the transplant
5407529 and then one of the team members said mr weeks youre having a very bad air day and you needed a lung transplant yesterday were here to help
5407530 a lot of that has to do with the fact that well consider organs that other people wont
5407531 you can do things to optimize the lung function before procurement it allows us to use a lot of organs that are viable but might not sound so over the phone
5407532 mr weekss illness had progressed to the point that the trip and the transplant evaluation were too much stress on him
5407533 by the time he got to us his survival could have been measured in weeks
5407534 they called my wife and more or less said please come quickly your husband is about to die
5407535 i really went through the whole thing like a piece of wood floating in a river
5407536 i just thought well im putting myself in their hands and gods and its going to be fine one way or another
5407537 the first time i met the transplant surgeon they had just coded my husband
5407538 im still not sure what it was about me that made them decide to do the transplant i was so sick
5407539 it often has a lot to do with how healthy the patient was before the crisis
5407540 gordon was in reasonably good physical condition before he took the sudden downhill turn
5407541 we knew we were giving him a survival benefit because he had no survival left with his lungs there are other diseases where we really debate about how much of a benefit were offering
5407542 so we want to time the transplant so that they really are at the end of the road with the lungs they have and that they can have a good recovery and good quality of life after transplant
5407543 theres no crystal ball to it and sometimes its hard to know whats best
5407544 to make the recovery easier they make the incision from armpit to armpit they open you up like a clam
5407545 some of it is also the sum of all sorts of little processes
5407546 the expertise and dedication of the physicians the coordinators the team aspect of delivering care were still doing the same protocol as institution x but were doing it better
5407547 but to me that means we have the most opportunity to make an impact
5407548 we dont want to just do more lung transplants we want to extend the longevity and quality of our transplants
5407549 kidneys now have about a 10 percent acute rejection rate at six months
5407550 and we still have about 50 percent acute rejection at six months
5407551 lung transplant has basically just been borrowing all the drugs from kidney transplant because theyre all weve got but the reality is that they dont work as well for us
5407552 the normal process is that the immune system operates to just get rid of the junk swallow it up in macrophages and dispose of it
5407553 we get what seems on the surface to be classic immunologic rejection
5407554 because the lungs are constantly exposed to the environment they have an intrinsic set of defense mechanisms that are there to deal with all the stuff youre breathing in
5407555 my idea is that this facet of the immune system plays a central role in orchestrating and regulating rejection in lung transplant
5407556 the hope would be that someday we could better gauge your risk for rejection after transplant based on some of these genetic variations in your innate immune system
5407557 it may result from coughing and changes in pressure in the abdominal cavities at this stage of disease
5407558 and the reflux may contribute to the lung disease by injuring the lungs when its inhaled we know its related and it could also be causative
5407559 theres a certain amount of bacteria in the aspirate material
5407560 were looking at whether the protein coats of these bacteria are whats triggering the immune attack on the lung
5407561 our protocol seems to play a large part in our outcomes
5407562 and were taking the observations were seeing in the clinics back to the laboratory so that we can use basic research to answer some of the still unanswered questions
5407563 id look over and see that my oxygen level was good but it felt like i wasnt breathing at all as dr davis puts it it takes some time for the lungs to fly
5407564 getting up for the first time after surgery was probably the hardest thing ever
5407565 there are definitely steps in the healing process and for me its been a long staircase
5407566 i was so weak that i showed up to rehab in a wheelchair and david best said to me youre not coming in on a wheelchair anymore get yourself a walker if you need to
5407567 and so i did and i used it for a while then one day he said get rid of that walker so i kicked it to the side as i walked in the door and thats where it stayed
5407568 i told my patients that they have a 50 percent chance of living five years
5407569 now i tell them eight years and its pretty amazing to see that change in 10 years
5407570 but the drive to live is so strong you dont want to let go and as much as it hurts and as weak as you are there is always tomorrow to heal to get better every day you do get stronger
5407571 i like to talk to them thank them and thank the person who gave them even though i dont know who that person is
5407572 i keep going back to how incredible that part of it is one forfeits his or her life but gives life to another and there are people here who can make it happen
5407573 where did the time go hes leaving home soon did we equip him with the knowledge and skills he needs to go out into the world what legacy is he leaving with
5407574 link this process isnt so bad when you just do it once but when i found myself going through this process repeatedly i knew i had to find a better way
5407575 were disappointed and surprised by the information that came to us late in the process
5407576 we are glad that it did come to our attention before we took action on his contract
5407577 gradually people are coming to realize that the term free has to do with access not with price

5407612 ive gotten a few requests to update the application for silverlight 2 beta 2
5407613 somewhere along the way the need to have a transaction log backup has crept in this seems pointless behaviour and it didnt used to work that way i have an rtm sql server 2005 in a virtual machine

5407691 if you want to run a marathon you have to like running everyday more than you like winning the race
5407692 for global movers and shakers the annual davos meeting is a secular mecca if you want to consort with the super wealthy and mega powerful partic ularly with ceos and board members from top companies this is the place to be you could even see it as the annual board meeting of planet earth inc
5407693 that said the reviews have been decidedly mixed this year
5407694 behind the scenes another global governance institution is on the brink of profound change
5407695 adequately appreciate changes in values society and technology and be better equipped to address the key global challenges the geopolitical economic and environmental dilemmas the global political landscape is in flux as the worlds preeminent power the leadership of the united states is critical for tackling many of the worlds problems in europe there is concern over identity and job creation both india and china continue to move ahead raising the question of how they may eventually come to dominate the global system latin america faces increased backlashes of populism and a new deal for africa is being constructed challenging business to play a greater role in the continents transformation
5407696 but for how long economic risks are rising everywhere can existing institutions handle these challenges most significantly there is a massive need for new jobs in all parts of the world
5407697 the global environment remains at risk the emphasis on climate change has created some scope for policy initiatives but we remain a long way from any consensus on a new direction to tackle the issue
5407698 states with poor governance ethnic cultural or religious tensions weak economies and porous borders will be prime breeding grounds for terrorism in such states domestic groups will challenge the entrenched government and transnational networks seeking safe havens
5407699 the over three billion individuals who will be living in water stressed regions from north china to africa and the implications for conflict
5407700 the environment and sustainability were just not on the davos agenda i felt like a fish out of water in 2000 however there were over a dozen sessions on various aspects of these subjects at the opening plenary climate change was voted the most important issue out of all the issues raised by six speakers to many peoples surprise
5407701 what really interested me was how ceo sentiment on leadership had shifted to a much broader appreciation of the softer aspects of leadership
5407702 the same opening of mental doors was going on for many of the environmental issues
5407703 wef is getting so media corrupted i despair of it as a forum for serious discussion
5407704 wef has now little to offer other than grandstanding and i suspect much hypocrisy
5407705 how about thinking of ways to get companies even governments to commit to specific actions and then to measure what they have actually achieved
5407706 i found it very socially and celebrity oriented there were moments when i was not sure whether i was at a hot new york dance club or a serious conference it was more reflective than generative in setting the international agenda overall it was a fascinating sociological microcosm of the upper strata of primarily western late twentieth century society
5407707 i find the prices they charge to attend outrageous there is something wacky about a place that purports to be focused on the great problems of our time including poverty charging admission fees that would pay for clean water installation for an african village
5407708 i think we are seeing that the constituency engaged in genuine global policy agendas is deepening
5407709 in the sense that there is more participation more academic input more partnership and more sensitivity to issues of legitimacy plus more of an opening to global issues through the security agenda
5407710 one thing that the protest movement still has which wef has never achieved and perhaps will never achieve is humour wef above all aspires to be serious whereas the protest movement is often more in tune with a culture of consumers and society that is characterized by irreverence rather than deference yet i think wef has both deflected a challenge to its own legitimacy and reached out in ways that as a european i feel offers something distinct and inclusive to the global agenda
5407711 these programs remain too thin on content and the selections seem somewhat haphazard rather than carefully calibrated to bring in strong next generation perspectives
5407712 the environmental sustainability index grew out of the wefs global leaders for tomorrow environmental task force in 1999
5407713 so my yale center for environmental law and policy took up the challenge of managing this project with support from the samuel family foundation of canada and the wef
5407714 we introduced a pilot esi in 2000 and a first full blown esi in 2001
5407715 in response to the critique which we accept that the concept of sustainability with its emphasis on underlying resource endowments past pollution as well as present results and future prospects is too all encompassing to provide a useful policy metric we are now working on a pilot environmental performance index that will track more narrowly results in seven core categories of pollution control and natural resource management with about twenty underlying indicators this new epi will gauge the distance to target for each issue thereby providing a better way to evaluate governmental performance particularly in the context of the millennium development goals emphasis on environmental sustainability the pilot epi will be released in davos in january 2006
5407716 having a musical background i really enjoyed the blues riffs kevin had chosen except it was all in the same key
5407717 so we took his great loops played with some musical ideas and put a simple blues chord progression to it next thing we knew we had a great little tune we call the short cummings
5407718 i really respect rob and his show and it was great of him to offer help
5407719 im not a musician and i had no idea how much variation was possible even though we only worked on this a little while i learned a lot
5407720 it was a fun learning experience for both kevin and i
5407721 it scares the hell out of me that she might actually get elected

5407723 ive been on the front lines of the online revolution
5407724 un parler ouvert ouvre un autre parler et le tire hors comme fait le vin ou lamour
5407725 im now calling on this energetic reformer to serve the children of america by continuing our vital work of improving our nations public schools
5407726 we must ensure that a high school diploma is a sign of real achievement so that our young people have the tools to go to college and to fill the jobs of the 21st century
5407727 in all our reforms we will continue to stand behind our nations teachers who work so hard for our children
5407728 all across america test scores are rising students are learning the achievement gap is closing teachers and principals are beaming with pride
5407729 a great opportunity for the administration to change the tone of its discourse with the education community
5407730 we look forward to finding common ground with ms spellings in her new role
5407731 humble and decent man who inspired his department and implemented the most significant federal education reform in a generation

5407751 the establishment of a free iraq is a watershed event in the global democratic revolution that success is sending a message from beirut to tehran
5407752 the lives of asians and pacific islanders are complex and they are made invisible by popular perceptions of our community as the model minority this report helps shatter those myths and raises important issues from which we as a community can and need to mobilize
5407753 when hate violence and harassment are cited as the communitys top concern and nearly one in five survey respondents has experienced physical harassment for being either asian pacific islander or lesbian gay bisexual or transgender it underscores the need for congress to pass and the president to sign federal hate crimes legislation
5407754 as the asian and pacific islander community grows in size and clout we cannot leave behind asians and pacific islanders who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender we are a part of both the api and lgbt communities and we raise our voices for inclusion in national debates around comprehensive and compassionate immigration reform punitive bans on marriage and hate violence that tears our community apart we are silent at our own peril
5407755 asian and pacific islander lgbt community members report pervasive harassment in the form of homophobia in the api community and racism in the lgbt community they are concerned with comprehensive and compassionate immigration reform how they are portrayed in the media and protecting their families and themselves from violence and harassment
5407756 these findings add to the growing body of evidence that support the need for not only legislative intervention but community introspection

5407762 look ive been talking to you for ages and i have no idea what you look like i reckon you could give an incredibly accurate description of my feet when the police ask you for a photofit of your assailant
5407763 im always doing that everyone tells me off about it but i cant help it looking right at people makes me sort of i dont know cringe a bit inside
5407764 but you shouldnt be in such a rush you give all the girls the impression that youre only interested in sex and nothing else its like it could be anyone as along as theyre female
5407765 we like it as well you know the difference is we want it to be a part of something not the be all and end all

5407775 a friend in elkhorn told me about the uw whitewater camp
5407776 i thought it would be a good experience for me and im loving it this is one of the best camps ive ever attended
5407777 its been so amazing there isnt a second you arent learning ive learned more here in a week than in two months of private lessons
5407778 ive met so many people and learned about so many different instruments not many people in the bahamas play other instruments besides the flute or the violin ive found that i really like the sound of the french horn its pretty
5407779 these camps are a unique experience because students eat sleep and breathe music
5407780 students learn from their teachers and from each other which makes them all around better players
5407781 closuredemo doesnt exist yet hit ok well call the function that creates it and try again
5407782 both comics identify the humour in the situation that the rules of a game world seem absurd when applied to the real world but while penny arcade understands that the crux of a joke should be reserved for the final panel ctrl alt del is apparently so excited about the idea that it blurts it out right away leaving three more panels to flounder in excessive dialogue and pointlessness

5407784 existing law makes it a crime for any person under specified circumstances to willfully cause or permit a child to suffer or to inflict on a child unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering
5407785 unjustifiable mental suffering ill say more about my attempt to get an answer from ms liebers office in a moment
5407786 there is contempt in the legislature for judeo christian values and ab 2943 is the most blatant evident of this attempt to take away our freedom to raise children according to our beliefs
5407787 to quote my west coast brethren but i suddenly felt compelled to do something totally random
5407788 turns out those guys didnt want to fight and i left a potentially hairy situation unscathed who knew being such an asshole can get you out of fights
5407789 looks hoping that i would keep my pubescent pie hole shut
5407790 even if i happened to get struck with a stray bullet during sunday service mind you looked at me and uncharacteristically asked
5407791 on cue i got up walked right in the middle of the melee and told all the parties involved
5407792 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
5407793 i know that drug workers and drug teams across the country are working tirelessly everyday to tackle drugs and change lives in fact i have met many people and teams who deserve to be nominated for these awards
5407794 in recent years we have introduced tough legislation to tackle drug supply and remain committed to informing young people of drug dangers through information campaigns like frank

5407940 so youre 4ft 11 but how big are your breasts
5407941 thank you for reminding me how small my breasts are
5407942 no no im not looking i didnt look im just saying
5407943 i dated a girl who was 4 ft 11 and she had double fs

5407948 we know that the vast majority of young people recognise right from wrong and make a positive contribution to our society there are a minority however who persist in anti social behaviour and some in more serious criminal activity
5407949 youth crime can have a devastating effect on victims and communities and must be tackled head on
5407950 increasingly we are able to identify these young people early and intervene to address the root causes of their behaviour including supporting and challenging their parents in meeting their responsibilities
5407951 but i want to call on parents to play their part tough enforcement and policing is only one part of the solution the new action we are launching today gives equal weight to the triple track approach of intensive prevention tough enforcement and support for parents
5407952 for that small minority of out of control young people custody is the answer the crimes they have committed are so serious that there can be no other way of dealing with them if they deserve to be inside they will go there
5407953 one aim of the new action plan is to divert young people away from crime so that they are not unnecessarily drawn into the criminal justice system
5407954 the plan will ensure that those at risk of offending are identified as quickly as possible and along with their families are given appropriate levels of support to tackle the cause of their behaviour
5407955 tough community sentences the new youth rehabilitation order and where necessary custodial sentences will force young people to face up to the suffering they have caused and ensure that they do not go unpunished but the plan also sets out how better resettlement will help reform these young people and get their lives back on track
5407956 the vast majority of young people are not involved in crime but we must to be tough on the few young people who are and reduce the harm they cause
5407957 by targeting families and spotting the problems where children and young people are getting out of control we can intervene and transform their lives providing them with a real opportunity to fulfil their potential
5407958 we said in the childrens plan that we would work together with mainstream services to prevent youth crime deal swiftly with those involved in youth crime and work to prevent re offending today this action plan does just that
5407959 people in the past who never had a voice are sharing stories details we can read the real stories of people who are experiencing news events

5407993 we know very little about corals found in the 30 to 100 meter depth range

5407995 our hawaiian archipelago is blessed with abundant life and i am pleased that my colleagues and i in the congress have been able to support noaas efforts to shed light on increasingly diverse segments of our complex ecosystem
5407996 the coalition of partners that will exploring hawaiis deep sea corals with todays grant funding mirrors the diversity of the natural ecosystem and it is my hope that cooperative efforts like this will form a firm foundation for community members to work together in the future
5407997 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5407998 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden
5407999 at its core this operation was about striking a blow against one of the most distressing aspects of serious and organised crime in this country that of people trafficking for sexual exploitation
5408000 it was a large scale coordinated operation based in gloucestershire and i am very proud that my staff have demonstrated excellence in delivering against the challenging task of national coordination
5408001 the figures show how successful we have has been in achieving our goals as a direct result of pentameter 2 more than 160 vulnerable people have been saved from lives of abuse exploitation and misery
5408002 perhaps even more importantly pentameter 2 has been instrumental in seriously disrupting the organised crime networks responsible for human trafficking
5408003 this is an example of how all forces and partners throughout the british isles have cooperated together against an important aspect of serious and organised crime pentameter 1 and pentameter 2 remain unique examples of nationally coordinated operations
5408004 human trafficking is a despicable crime perpetrated by organised criminal gangs whose business is to make money from human misery
5408005 pentameter 2 has been a great success it is an excellent example of partnership working and i would commend all those involved who have made a real impact in rescuing victims and bringing to justice those who exploit them
5408006 human trafficking has no place in modern society and i am absolutely determined that we continue to take tough action to disrupt these criminal gangs as a signal of this commitment the government signed the council of europe convention on human trafficking last year and will ratify it by the end of this year
5408007 pentameter 2 has been a great success and now the results need to be analysed in depth to see what we have actually found
5408008 the results from pentameter 2 highlight that great steps have been taken to tackle the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation we need to build on what we have learnt and take this momentum forward the ukhtc will continue to coordinate for the service in this regard and with its partners will continue to take forward a diverse range of programmes to ensure that the uk becomes a hostile environment for traffickers

5408059 what kind of man is this even the winds and the waves obey him
5408060 northern commands inability to integrate leadership planning and operations with some of its most experienced stakeholders has left the dod unconnected and the national guard under equipped and has sabotaged any real progress toward establishing a tiered coordinated homeland military response to major emergencies
5408061 instead of working with the governors the national guard bureau and the state adjutants general northern command has held the countrys historic first military responders at arms length northern command needs to accept its supporting role or get out of the way
5408062 the united states northern command is supposed to be out in front in the pentagons efforts to support civil authorities in emergencies it should be planning and identifying possible equipment shortfalls above all it should be working closely with state and local communities instead the command is doing very little of this core activity the national guard which will carry out the bulk of any domestic response takes this mission very seriously the guard has built new units and brought in much needed equipment working closely with states every day these reports underscore the importance of the national guard empowerment act of 2008 which helps sharpen dods focus on the guards vital missions
5408063 the active duty military faces a unique cultural challenge in defining its role in domestic emergency response clearly a bias against playing a supporting role to civilian authorities has resulted in large gaps in northcoms ability to fulfill its stated mission the fact is governors and their national guard are and will continue to be our nations first domestic military responders and until they and northcom can work together more seamlessly northcoms ability to be of assistance in homeland response will continue to face significant challenges
5408064 northcoms duty is to provide military support to states and the department of homeland security but it hasnt fully figured out this emergency support mission any crack in our emergency preparedness capability today will become a gaping hole in our catastrophic response tomorrow northcom must be a shining example of cooperation with state and federal partners so that when called upon for support they will be ready to assist concept plans sitting on a bookshelf and interagency conference calls dont make up for a lack of operational planning true readiness is found by practicing like we will have to play in a true disaster
5408065 dear diary xfce is dreamy but doesnt know i exist
5408066 you have gathered today to tell the whole world that we are a voice of justice and values and humanity that we are a voice of coexistence and a just and rational dialogue
5408067 thats why the conference invitation was extended to face the challenges of isolation ignorance and narrow horizons so that the world can absorb the good message of islam
5408068 our brothers in the kingdom of saudi arabia have presented a great message to all humanity in the world
5408069 before we speak with other religions we must speak among ourselves and reach an understanding on a particular islamic path
5408070 we should support each other not weaken each other or sully each others reputation
5408071 as a muslim and a shiite and an expert in islamic issues i tell you that there are many things in common between us and theres no need to look at differences

5408075 were happy to have played a role in working out the problems so we could move forward with this transportation project so vital to the area
5408076 without the hard work of the virginia delegation and the people at the department of transportation federal funding for this project wouldve been lost
5408077 this award is in recognition of the excellent care and support professor isaacs has given me he doesnt leave a stone unturned when it comes to my care and he goes above and beyond the call of duty to help me and other patients in the area who live with this difficult disease
5408078 the healthcare champions awards recognise the skill expertise and compassion of rheumatology health professionals across the uk this is particularly important at a time when many of the ra services and highly skilled staff working in this important field are under threat from a lack of funding and the way in which service reforms are being applied by pcts rheumatoid arthritis does not get the priority it should although it is a serious common autoimmune chronic disease which can shorten lifespan and people who suffer from it require on going care and follow up for the rest of their lives
5408079 three years ago we set ourselves the tough challenge to reduce all crime by 15 per cent
5408080 the governments priority is to build on what we have achieved so that everyone feels improvement

5408089 ive seen some kids as young as second or third grade use planners the very elementary planners
5408090 letting kids see that a planner can help them get their projects done and organize their time at home can be very helpful
5408091 the biggest reward is that the child finished the project without the stress of waiting until the last minute and that will build confidence for the next major project success breeds success
5408092 it gives young people the idea that one does organize ones life
5408093 it can be used for the students personal lives as well storing sheets of music schedules phone numbers or applications
5408094 if the student has 10 vocabulary words he has to know for a friday quiz he can be taught to learn three or four a night and review them on thursday
5408095 its very helpful if parents have some sort of calendar that is large enough and is posted in a prominent place
5408096 in one color you have written when the science fair project is due and then you backtrack from that date breaking down that science fair project into manageable chunks of time great big projects tend to scare kids
5408097 a mistake that many parents want to make is that all their children have exactly the same routine for homework and any parent with more than one child can tell you that children learn differently from each other
5408098 when you start by setting up a paper flow system your child can see results the next day
5408099 the new ps3 controller uses six axis motion sensors to move with the users body because of this sensitivity it cant use vibration
5408100 immersion would be happy to step in and solve their problem
5408101 if it truly is a conflict between vibration and motion sensing we have some of the worlds experts in the field of haptic technology or force feedback and we already have three ways we know how to solve the problem but were not willing to work with them until weve resolved this long simmering legal battle so if this is really a technical hurdle were confident that we can solve this through filtering techniques through processing techniques and through hardware modifications

5408116 when students come in they are given a network that is up and running but we dont guarantee that it is secure

5408118 at the end of the day no data has been compromised and no one is going to get fired
5408119 you can make an argument that this is not only good sport but an excellent corporate security training exercise

5408121 wed been checking out mitt romneys background as part of our routine reporting ahead of the republican primary elections
5408122 we found all the usual things son of privilege wealthy political family ethically suspect business dealings no fixed moral compass but the fact that romney is also canadas prime minister took us by complete surprise apparently he was elected exactly two years ago after the collapse of the liberal government it almost makes me feel a little america centric not knowing that we should probably pay more attention to our friendly neighbors to the north
5408123 mitt romneys main platform planks best we can tell were the resettlement of inuit tribes for oil exploration and the automatic deportation of illegal immigrant elk
5408124 somehow that must have struck a chord with the canadian electorate
5408125 mr romney wasnt trying to keep it a secret or anything he just didnt think the canadian prime minister thing was relevant in the context of the gop primaries
5408126 the question now of course is whether or not the fact that mr romney is already prime minister of another country automatically disqualifies him for consideration as a presidential candidate
5408127 someone should probably look in the constitution but we may as well wait until the republican primary election results are in then cross that bridge if we come to it

5408208 this book was hilarious i love daisys work and i love the fact that the gorgeous hero falls for the life sized woman and not the anorexic teen queen types this book was magic and the amount of research that went into it must have been phenomenal reading it was like taking a really fun history class on the lesser known sumerian gods and customs i love the humor in the book it is a perfect example of what a love story should be
5408209 daisy dexter dobbs has created another humorous fanciful tale filled with real people and emotions in samantha and her genie though he hates the confinement of the bottle and dark void of his existence while trapped there lugal has accepted his fate and given up on hoping that the goddess innana will ever hear his pleas its a bit of a challenge to not attack all of the gadgets sam has in her home and this leads to some very funny situations but lugal also wants to learn about his temporary home samantha is a compassionate woman who hates to see others hurting so the fact that she falls for lugal so quickly isnt difficult to believe between incredibly erotic and adventurous sexual encounters lugal and samantha get to know each other fairly well and it doesnt take her long to realize that lugal doesnt deserve his fate but will she be able to break his curse i highly recommend picking up a copy of the very amusing samantha and her genie to find out
5408210 when i chose samantha and her genie to review i half expected to read the usual clich s often found in genie stories i was delighted to find i was so wrong daisy does a truly amazing job of creating a story that was totally uplifting and entranced me with its uniqueness her superbly written graphic depiction dialogue and characterization were endearing emotional on various levels and utterly engrossing the love scenes are scorching and enough to raise the temperature of the reader to incendiary levels mine sure did the interaction between the characters was highly entertaining and often a great source of amusement especially lugal his thirst for knowledge led to some hilarious scenes that had me virtually rolling around laughing though undeniably sad at times there are plenty of humorous moments to lighten the mood i highly recommend this novel to those that love sexy romantic hot stories that will have the reader running a gamut of emotions as the story evolves furthermore i was so impressed with this novel that i will be looking to add more books by daisy dexter dobbs to my virtual library in the very near future
5408211 when a man equal in beauty to the gods appeared sam is instantly thrown into a full fledged case of lust not only does she get to make three wishes she has this gorgeous warrior lusting after her as well sam and lugal soon find that there is more to their relationship than lust and sam vows to do anything to prevent lugal from returning to his bottle at the end of their six months together samantha and her genie is a cute story filled to the brim with steamy sex ultimate romance readers will surely get their moneys worth with this story you may even experience a tear or two as sam and lugal try to find there happily ever after

5408219 i humiliate gandalf in front of the king doing level six harm in instinct and making him give me a pony
5408220 the player states the characters intention and the story guide sets the stakes
5408221 the gm being able to specify whether or not harm occurs on a roll and the player not being able to this is one of those double standards that seems rather well completely at odds with the entire tone of the t so y mechanics i just dont think you can get harm in a non bdtp roll with some rare exceptions like using sudden knife
5408222 the player should always set the stakes and narrate when he wins

5408296 how dare you make me look at those ugly pictures
5408297 i am a bit surprised or maybe not surprised that no one brought up the issue of linguistics semantics or whatever it is called when we play with the meaning of words
5408298 the question of whether you are obese or not is answered simply by the definition of the word which i guess means that you are obese
5408299 it is too bad that the general population and society overall has picked up what is supposed to be a scientific term and used it to be an insult some of the failure is our own as we all seem to have a subconscious disdain for people with the physical attribute of being fat we even dislike ourselves if we perceive ourselves as overweight some people dont are and more power to them also some cultures do not see it as a problem so i am being culture centric just made that up when i express these opinions
5408300 my point if i have one is that the word was not meant to be an insult when it was first used something like the word moron to describe an adult person with mental capacity below 12 years old a fairly insulting name today alsoretard which basically meant slow if you ever had to adjust the timing on a car you would not consider the word retard all that bad but it is now an insult it is probably true of many words i will not digress any further
5408301 i guess what i am saying is what we all people reading your blog already know ugh i wanted to say something dramatic there and it just didnt come i guess we dont know what we think we know
5408302 some of us are obese or were obese and we dont like it we dont like being called or thought of as fat because fat is bad right fat people are ugly they are fat bastards nobody loves them but their mothers obese means fatter than fat because some scientist said it so it must be more true than when the school bully called me fat wow i didnt know where to end that sidetrack
5408303 so jimmy basically you are as fat as you think you are nothing really exists outside your mind anyway there are plenty of skinny little school girls that are puking behind the dumpster right now because they firmly believe they are fat you may or may not sympathize with them
5408304 i never understood the thought process myself until i actually lost a bunch of weight i always looked at skinny people who said they were fat and needed to lose weight and i thought they were crazy also an insult that may have had a less insulting origin i really dont know um i thought they were crazy and i didnt care a bit how fat heavy obese i was i ate whatever i wanted and then some i liked my size i was happy with it now i am down within the proper bmi range barely and all i can do is tell people that i am fat and need to lose another 5 pounds i am now one of those people that looks thin but inside i know i am fat
5408305 so i guess i am warning you about the mental trap dont or do let it get you
5408306 i am certain that you can lose a bunch more pounds you may not even look any different to anyone else i just lost 10 lbs in last month but noone would ever notice 10 20 30 lbs is not as much as it sounds if you follow the lifestyle also another word with a different meaning for swingers you will be able to lose the 30 and more
5408307 i guess the real issue is whether you need to keep thinking about it
5408308 you know jimmy you probably ought to set a date in the future where you will drop the whole diet weight low carb issue and concern yourself with life and the rest of its pleasures
5408309 i dont mean to drop the eating plan just forget the blog and the rest of the fat bastards and let them figure it out for themselves i think that is what i am gonna do right after i lose this last 10 lbs

5408312 if all other precautions fail consider the use of an over the counter anti diarrhea product such as imodium studies have shown this has reduced problems related to those prone to exercise induced diarrhea it is not recommended to use this on a daily basis
5408313 lets see who can take it deep for the longest
5408314 we should show kc how to take it up the ass
5408315 in 2005 when bird flu arrived we needed tamiflu the antiviral drug that can cure h5n1 we contacted roche
5408316 they said we couldnt have any we would have to wait two years because industrialised countries had already made advance purchase orders
5408317 none of the cities really managed to get the perfect strength of intervention
5408318 when we receive virus from indonesia we will not share it with industry
5408319 there will be a mechanism for doing that in a transparent way
5408320 the sharing of virus will be done in a manner that does not threaten global public health
5408321 we will agree with the who a timetable to make the changes necessary to accomplish our objective of equitable and affordable access to vaccine by developing countries
5408322 a mechanism like that is more dangerous than the threat of an h5n1 pandemic itself
5408323 were grateful to indonesia for focusing attention on this inequity
5408324 thailand supports the view of indonesia but has not yet decided not to share our virus we will wait for the jarkarta meeting to decide what to do next
5408325 the timing and severity of the next pandemic we cannot predict however the probability that a pandemic will occur has increased
5408326 the first very important step theres a long way to go
5408327 this is in the interim to get us through this period
5408328 ideally yes you would like a vaccine that would have a higher efficacy
5408329 we feel as part of pandemic preparedness it would be best to have a licensed vaccine our review suggests this vaccine is safe and effective
5408330 to benefit from sharing virus samples including access to quality pandemic vaccines
5408331 we are sending out our virus to rich countries to produce vaccines
5408332 and when the pandemic occurs they survive and we die
5408333 we have the virus we are getting sick then they take the virus from the who and make vaccine for themselves
5408334 this news is a bit surprising because its not the time of year when we have a lot of bird migration if it was going to happen we would expect it to happen in spring not the middle of winter
5408335 if this is a secondary case it is much more serious if this is the first case and we can stamp it out the outbreak will be controlled
5408336 i dont think it has made any difference to the threat to the human population
5408337 were encouraging all farmers to be incredibly vigilant and look at their flocks carefully we do need to reassure consumers however that this is not an issue about safety of poultry
5408338 there has been a case of h5n1 avian influenza at the holton site but it is important to stress that none of the affected birds have entered the food chain
5408339 i would say 0 8 per cent is too low
5408340 but it is important to harmonise our sampling techniques or we cant compare data
5408341 im most concerned that we may be sampling the wrong end of the bird
5408342 the cells with 2 3 sialic acid receptors have been associated with the bronchial mucins
5408343 may contribute to the spread of influenza at least in ferrets
5408344 we were really trying to resolve the struggle over which was responsible
5408345 people were looking at whether one or the other might have done it but never the whole issue at once
5408346 javanese farmers even have a word for the cat disease
5408347 at least that percentage shows the virus has not completely adapted to cats yet
5408348 we know the 1918 pandemic was a bird flu virus that adapted to mammals in some intermediate mammalian host possibly pigs
5408349 this may mean fewer deaths or more depending on how the resistant virus behaves
5408350 what surprised us is that even if the resistant strain spreads quite widely its emergence will delay the peak of the pandemic by as much as a year
5408351 the whole point is to delay the pandemic until we can get a good vaccine made
5408352 our study suggests that you could get more benefit than the simulations show
5408353 our hypothesis is that influenza can survive in ice over the winter and re infect birds as they come back in spring
5408354 the important issue is whether or not theres infectious virus
5408355 but if the virus was in droppings which presumably is how it was deposited there seems to be no reason why it should not freeze and survive at low temperatures
5408356 the kind of consistently freezing conditions you would expect to need to preserve a virus are unlikely to be found in places that are heavily populated with people
5408357 we recommend more research to study how tamiflu behaves in water and to determine cheap and easy ways to break it down before it reaches the river
5408358 too many existing social networks keep users locked in to their services
5408359 with an open source code base and support for standard data exchange formats we are giving users back the autonomy to control their own social web presence

5408370 we have reached the end of the beginning of the digital terrestrial television process now we move to national rollout
5408371 for digital television to succeed as a replacement for the analogue services it needs to be accessible to all it must be simple to set up and user friendly offer more high quality services and channels and the receiver equipment must be affordable and easy to obtain my department will be working to ensure manufacturers and retailers work in tandem with rt and the new bci licensee to ensure that a range of digital television receivers are available in advance of the autumn 2009 launch date
5408372 this trial has provided an opportunity for all of us to learn about digital television and what it can do
5408373 central to the success of national rollout will be a public information campaign by the department explaining digital television to the nation my department will begin this national information campaign in march 2009 in advance of the autumn 2009 launch date analogue switch off must be complete by 2012 we have a tight timeframe but i am confident that with all players working together and with public buy in that digital television in ireland will offer new and exciting content and technology to the irish viewer

5408384 by the green shiny bench it was a good place to sit i sat there a long while
5408385 as different as is possible but nicer in some ways a little chilly here dont you think
5408386 well the sun was hot but nicely drowsy in the shade
5408387 you do not mind do you its more light here

5408394 like you will when you reach the end of yours
5408395 but i am just here for the ride no particular end in mind
5408396 but you have to have to have an end in mind or sight like those people did
5408397 some folk were here before your stop others will be here beyond your destination
5408398 a short journey for some like the lady near me
5408399 it is your perception it was long enough for her
5408400 if you call it sharing we hardly glanced at each other
5408401 you did share it whether you were aware or unaware of them
5408402 but soon i will get off too my destination will approach after a while
5408403 i guess i will wait for the train to return to my stop
5408404 it does not it does not take the return route
5408405 oh yes you do you know full well where to go
5408406 that hardly matters here what matters is where you go

5408471 why is mia still in school why hasnt she settled down with that nice boy shes the oldest of the grand kids and nothing from her yet when is she going to have a baby

5408480 the most brutal ugly degenerate vicous form of expression it has been my displeasure to hear
5408481 it is a lovely ballad that he first recorded ten years ago and it now inspired many young couples who had been sitting tired to twisting to get up and move slowly around the dance floor holding one another very close sinatras intonation precisely clipped yet full and flowing gave a deeper meaning to the simply lyrics in the wee small hours of the morning while the whole wide world is fast asleep you lie awake and think about the girl

5408483 the need to improve the efficiency of existing processes especially raw material use is driving this demand
5408484 these solutions allow the effective use of raw materials including fibre and energy
5408485 a majority of end users also believe that acs systems are extremely costly
5408486 the roi on these products is difficult to observe in the short term and gaining approval for new installations and system upgrades can be tricky
5408487 released on sub pop in 1990 before grohl joined the band which cobain said
5408488 1 while the sessions went well generally vig said cobain would become moody and difficult at times
5408489 looking back on the production of mastered on the afternoon of august 2 in the mastering lab in hollywood california
5408490 in the beginning it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end maybe i misconstrued their instructions so you can call it my mistake if you want maybe i didnt write it down when nirvana or the record company said to do it so when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so cds albums and cassettes it wasnt on there
5408491 yeah i was happy about it it was pretty cool it was kind of neat but i dont give a shit about some kind of achievement like that its cool i guess
5408492 we didnt do anything it was just one of those get out of the way and duck records
5408493 with nevermind nirvana has certainly succeeded there are enough intriguing textures mood shifts instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment
5408494 nevermind is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like entertainment weekly gave
5408495 when nirvana released bleach all those years ago the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away my god have they proved us right
5408496 if nirvana isnt onto anything altogether new nevermind does possess the songs character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radios high octane hits
5408497 most of nevermind is packed with generic punk pop that had been done by countless acts from red hot chili peppers
5408498 the band has little or nothing to say settling for moronic ramblings by singer lyricist cobain
5408499 as a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory like de la soul in 1990 instead their multiplatinum takeover constituted the first full scale public validation of the amerindie values the noise the toons the tude the radder half of the pazz amp jop poll electorate came up on
5408500 kurt cobains guitar sound on nirvanas nevermind set the tone for nineties rock music
5408501 even though you couldnt quite tell what he was singing about you knew it was intense as hell
5408502 why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second rate freudian evaluation of my lyrics when 90 percent of the time theyve transcribed them incorrectly
5408503 in the four months following their break up kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs all of them about tobi vail
5408504 one baby to another said im lucky to have met you
5408505 some of my very personal experiences like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling very lonely sick
5408506 if youre offended by this you must be a closet pedophile
5408507 if you look real close there is a picture of alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream establishing its commercial and cultural viability 61
5408508 it was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did
5408509 suddenly all bets are off no one has the inside track on which of dozens perhaps hundreds of ornery obstreperous unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall walking millions

5408511 the situation in china is quite confusing and there is some conflicting information
5408512 we really dont know how many strains of bird flu there are in china because we have limited amounts of information shared with us by the ministry of agriculture and the virus samples we have asked for have not been shared
5408513 up to now the bird flu viruses selected from the south share a high uniformity
5408514 there has been no marked change in the biological characteristics of the organisms
5408515 its our understanding that there have certainly been changes in the virus and continual evolution in the virus since 2004 and the viruses that we requested from 2005 have still not been shared with who
5408516 we need to clear up the picture and for this the sharing of information is vital
5408517 we are presently several billion doses short of the amount of pandemic influenza vaccine we would need to protect the global population
5408518 we would like to be able to be in a position of reaching 10 or 20 of the population as soon as possible
5408519 if death of poultry is used as the only indication of h5n1 infection but the emergence of human cases is ignored the consequence will be increased transmission of the virus in poultry
5408520 as far as i know all 20 human cases recognised since november 2005 were caused by this virus
5408521 this novel variant may have become dominant because it was not as easily affected as other strains by the current avian vaccine

5408530 a university of colorado faculty committee has recently heard testimony in professor ward churchills final internal appeal of the chancellors recommendation that he be fired for research misconduct the faculty committee is also holding hearings on prof churchills grievances concerning a selective or pretextual enforcement and b breaches of confidentiality by university officials their recommendations will be sent to president hank brown who in turn will make a recommendation to the board of regents who have the final say
5408531 to be clear the issues here have nothing to do with the quality of ward churchills scholarship or his professional credentials however one views his choice of words or specific arguments he is being put in the dock solely for his radical critique of u s history and present day policy in the wake of the events of september 11 2001 apparently 9 11 is now the third rail of american intellectual life to critically probe into its causes and to interrogate the international role of the united states is treated as heresy those inquiring can be denied forums careers and even personal safety through all this new ground rules are being established any criticism or even questioning of the institutional foundations of the united states or of the motives and interests behind its policies will be treated as essentially treasonous left unopposed this trajectory will lead to a situation of uncontested indoctrination enforced by the state

5408542 it brings little satisfaction to have been right about this but weve said since last year the census was in real peril
5408543 the 2000 census used the paper follow up and by all accounts it was the most successful count ever building on that experience this short form only census could be as good or better with the use of other proven technologies such as gps for address verification i look forward to hearing more at next weeks subcommittee hearing about how the commerce department and the census bureau plan to fund this fall back approach and get the 2010 census back on track

5408545 a simple comparison of the cost of the flywheel with a traditional battery clearly indicates that returns on investment can be obtained within the first two and a half to three years of its 20 year lifetime
5408546 market participants can increase the year on year volume of sales to encourage end users to deploy flywheels instead of replace their batteries
5408547 the worst case scenario for the flywheel is the reduction in the vacuum
5408548 manufacturers take this issue into account and design the required monitoring electronics to keep constant tab on the pressure inside the containerized wheel

5408556 i hope one day the spurs fans who have been brilliant to me can understand this too
5408557 i have only good things to say about my time at tottenham and expect them to go from strength to strength under juande ramos and daniel levy

5408584 the children were very aware of their culture and history who their ancestors were
5408585 theres a lot of connection between the school and the home that doesnt exist here
5408586 the ones who learn it are more aware of their own language that applies to exchange programs with leaders in education
5408587 simply having a teacher involved is not going to produce that same investment

5408590 oh my god the message scene was the funniest ever and tonys comments were just hysterical i mean i wouldnt go through that for million bucks hes just a good sport i really enjoy this show i just started watching it this year thanks tony for the laughs
5408591 this is a long time coming it was a fuel strategy race but my team called it perfectly for me i know i was on the same strategy at helio castroneves and when i passed him for the lead i couldnt believe it this is fabulous
5408592 i think danica is such a fantastic person and im thrilled for her that the monkey is finally off of her back we have all believed in her and she proved today that she is a winner frankly i think this is the first of many
5408593 the high priest of the god of revenge came down the stairs and he was an elf with a human name i talked to him and learned that both of his parents had goblin names and his grandparents had elven names so i guessed that his grandparents had been abducted and that the humans had then liberated the tower placing the goblin named parents under human control before they had their child this was more or less correct but a bit more happened so way back when the demon was causing all sorts of trouble fighting both the humans and the elves and destroying their cities this went on for 40 years an elf managed to tear off the demons nose about halfway through this rampage but he couldnt finish the job because he had lost a limb in the fight before the nose removal and lost the rest of his limbs afterward prior to being burned to death eventually the demon was shot in the year 45 and the humans took over the goblin tower many of the goblins fled into the mountains and others were enslaved including some of their abductees

5408595 today the government has laid an order in parliament to proscribe the entirety of hizballahs military wing in substitution for the existing entry
5408596 hizballahs military wing is providing active support to militants in iraq who are responsible for attacks both on coalition forces and on iraqi civilians including providing training in the use of deadly roadside bombs
5408597 it is because of this support for terrorism in iraq and occupied palestinian territories that the government has taken this action proscription of hizballahs military wing will not affect the legitimate political social and humanitarian role hizballah plays in lebanon but it sends out a clear message that we condemn hizballahs violence and support for terrorism we continue to call on hizballah to end terrorist activity and its support for terrorism in iraq and occupied palestinian territories abandon its status as an armed group and participate in the democratic process on the same terms as other lebanese political parties

5408600 people in the past who never had a voice are sharing stories details we can read the real stories of people who are experiencing news events
5408601 if you want to run a marathon you have to like running everyday more than you like winning the race
5408602 we dont need what j2ee gives but jini has everything
5408603 we need a vaccine capable of inducing an effective human immune response against a range of h5n1 viruses that may emerge in future
5408604 all confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness
5408605 to date the investigation has found no evidence of spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient human to human transmission has occurred
5408606 these people are trying to scare us to death over something that may never happen
5408607 we dont need prime ministers to come out and say well cut off the tops of trees or drain the wetlands to kill the carriers
5408608 we are far from out of the woods with h5n1
5408609 stockpiling pre pandemic vaccines is more valuable than people realise
5408610 it may not necessarily protect you from infection but it will probably stop you dying
5408611 it has caused no systemic toxicity in human trials because the adjuvant never enters the bloodstream
5408612 because m2e specific antibodies have shown substantial protection in animal models and humans dont normally make such antibodies during infection i believe it makes sense to develop and test an m2 specific vaccine in humans
5408613 we were surprised to see such wide divergence over such a short time
5408614 but then you would not expect to see so many different lineages
5408615 we really have to get our act together on human and animal surveillance
5408616 these excellent clinical trial results represent a significant breakthrough all being well we expect to make regulatory filings for the vaccine in the coming months
5408617 its a very important issue that needs to be clarified urgently roy wadia a spokesman for the world health organization said on thursday in beijing
5408618 it raises questions as to how many other cases may not have been found at the time or may have been found retrospectively in testing
5408619 we do not yet have an explanation from the authors
5408620 it can all be done at room temperature except one step that needs refrigeration
5408621 producing at lab scale is entirely different from producing at commercial scale
5408622 i see no reason why this process shouldnt scale up quite easily
5408623 were just interested in using chemistry to save human lives
5408624 wu chun cao has reported to us by telephone and facsimile that emails that arrived at the new england journal of medicine earlier this week bearing his name were not sent by him
5408625 he has not requested withdrawal of the report and so it stands as published in the issue of june 22 we are continuing to investigate
5408626 its a very important issue that needs to be clarified urgently roy wadia of the world health organization said in beijing
5408627 it raises questions as to how many other cases may not have been found at the time or may have been found retrospectively in testing
5408628 so all the attention focused on it is very very valid
5408629 the ornithology community has been slow to acknowledge that wild birds might be playing some role
5408630 at a time when migratory birds are being unfairly portrayed solely as the harbingers of death and disease
5408631 the real question is not are wild birds to blame but why are wild birds being blamed
5408632 assuming you cant stop it at its source you can do a lot to ameliorate it
5408633 what is really important is how many flu cases are going to turn up at the hospital and doctors surgery
5408634 i do not believe theres a healthcare system in the world that can readily absorb a 1968 type pandemic and heaven help us if we get a 1918 type pandemic
5408635 and the economic impact is going to be large its worthwhile spending money on planning
5408636 if you wish to vaccinate those most at risk of death its granny and grandpa at the head of a plan
5408637 if we gave that to everyone and stockpiled 40 to 50 million antiviral treatments in britain we might cut the number of cases as much as 80
5408638 arrey yaar my hands are freezing due to the cold let me heat them up
5408639 dont you worry baby i am just your best friend and a girl
5408640 oh saluja dont do it to me i am only your colleague
5408641 you are so late today saroja you had your dinner at office only
5408642 no aunty actually i could not get time for dinner i was working continuously i have to make something for myself quickly and eat now
5408643 saroja change your clothes and come to my home my husband had to suddenly change his plan and will be reaching tomorrow night instead of today night his food freshly cooked in the evening is lying untouched come fast in the meanwhile i will arrange to serve the food
5408644 saroja you are a doctor and for some time now i wanted to ask you something
5408645 what is it tell me aunty can i be of some help
5408646 actually i feel shy to speak out things like this
5408647 i have contracted a disease in my private parts and at times it itches like mad i had never had any kind of disease leave alone a skin problem
5408648 i dont want to go to a strange doctor and exhibit my private parts you see even my first delivery was attended to by my mother and our neighborhood lady doctor in my town i feel extremely shy to go to a doctor with this kind of problem so i thought since you are a doctor you can give me some medicine and ointment and help me get rid of this one month old problem
5408649 aunty actually i am a research doctor of naturopathy but i think i can help you i will give you a combination of medicine ointment and physiotherapy it will take some time to cure completely but i suppose since it is an unconventional method it would be better if you dont discuss it with anybody including your husband
5408650 aunty actually i dont treat patients i am doing it only from theory i know today i will only inspect the area and understand the extent of spread of your disease my treatment will start from tomorrow
5408651 without clothes i can feel so comfortable just because you are there you know we are very orthodox back home till my husband forced me six years back i was using clean cloth pads during periods now have a look at my private parts
5408652 but you are examining without touching me dont hesitate i dont mind if you touch me down there
5408653 there is no hesitation only i am making some minute observations in fact i am afraid i have to touch you thoroughly down there in our kind of treatment
5408654 not much aunty there is an infection it can be reduced in three to four days and can be cured permanently now i will physically examine you it may be ticklish but you have to bear it
5408655 was the massage ok auntie we increase blood circulation to the diseased part and the germs are fought off now i am going to touch the diseased portion be calm
5408656 auntie this happens initially in our treatment new patients get overwhelmed by the attentions they get on their nether parts now since i am known to you and if you have no objection i can hold you in my arms and calm you down shall i auntie shook her head in affirmation i sat on the bed by the side of aunty and took her upper torso in my hands some thing must have taken over me because the excited aunty looked so lovable to me i lost my control i brushed her hair aside and caressed her lovely round face i then lifted her body with such force and planted a kiss on her lips aunty responded by simply closing her eyes tightly shut but her lips were yearning for more i must have planted a hundred kisses all over her face before planting the sexiest of them all on her juicy lips aunty shuddered once again when my rebellious tongue forced her lips open and caressed the inner side of her lips now it was understood by the aunty that i was her new lover and she yielded in a magnificent manner aunty cuddled up closer to me and started kissing me on my neck the kissing was a frenzied one aunty was shaking with tears in her eyes she continued kissing me slowly and reached my lips in a few looong seconds hair stood on my body now it was my turn to yield to the aunty her kissing was more passionate more persistent and more natural than my own i slowly laid down and closed my eyes now i was shaking in anticipation of aunties action my shaking had to increase because aunty beat my judgment of her and got down to removing my clothes she struggled and got me fully nude in a few minutes my god it was too much for me to believe it was a dream come true aunty was now very calm in her approach she started massaging my thighs in circular motions from outer to inner thighs aunty must have been pleasuring her husband thoroughly because she knew exactly how to touch now i was shaking with excitement i never expected this kind of a reversal and what pleasure waves i got when aunty slowly reached my outer labia and started caressing it soon i was swollen all over my pussy i thought aunty was more innovative than i was she ran her fingers on my thigh junction and pressed my outer labia at the same time in such a manner i just could not control myself i wriggled my ass vigorously and sort of tried to escape from her in reply aunty pushed me down with force and spread my legs so wide my clitoris was hopelessly exposed in front of her aunty gave the same treatment to my clit as i had given to her i started choking with pleasure my pussy became so wet i felt a drop or two dripping down my cunt but now aunty was determined to go for the kill i saw aunty take a position similar to the one in the comics she moved to my side and my gaawwdd she drank in the view of my heaving wet vagina for a few long seconds and i died of over excitement because now aunty plunged her face in my pussy and started licking my vaginal lips very sensually and rhythmically what would a dead girl do i lay there with my soul moving out of the body and enjoying the scene aunty went beyond my killing and explored every millimeter of my swollen cunt i was brought back into my body when aunty started playing with my very clit head aunty was busy disrobing my clit head with her salivated tongue aunty teased pulled and fully exposed the bulb of a clit head several times i died several deaths and i had started a desire for these deaths with such intensity i thought i will never ever stay away from this loving aunty these emotions mixed with unbearable pleasures made me reach the peak my best orgasm i burst out with pleasure with explosions taking place non stop i was crying moaning producing loud sounds in response aunty changed her gear and started licking my pussy all over in a soothing manner now she was very delicate in her touches aunty thought she will calm me down but i was a gone case i came again with a massive intensity and twisted and turned in a fit aunty lazily moved and lay by my side with eyes closed i convulsed with the after effects of my coming for a few minutes then i also laid still for a solid five minutes i was full of shame and guilt i thought once the passions were over aunty must be feeling ashamed of herself i was the first to get up without caring to clean our juices i wore my dress after a lot of effort i could clear my throat and utter in a husky voice aunty i am going home see you later
5408657 i must thank you saroja my infection is gone and these twenty days i tried a lot to forget you and that incident but the more i tried to forget you the bigger was the urge to take you in my hand and love you and saroja believe me i am not at all feeling guilty about what i allowed you to do and about what i did to you on the contrary i feel like exploring more of you and satisfy you

5408659 in the past small entrepreneurs would turn to dubious sources for a loan but that has changed with the system of business cash advance

5408662 neither did i have to submit financials or tax returns nor was bad credit a problem

5408664 prior research on preservice teacher education has not focused on this
5408665 but we need to understand how to prepare teachers who are familiar with important disciplinary ideas and practices have a view of student learning in relation to this disciplinary content and who continually make sense of student thinking as they make instructional decisions
5408666 its challenging for faculty as experts in the field to define a reasonable chunk to study what typically happens is that they take a swath across a lot of topics and rightly link these topics with current issues
5408667 were entering into the discipline with them from a very different point of view than in the introductory classes
5408668 this is going to be a critical phase for us
5408669 weve seen them try to enact their training in controlled circumstances in classrooms and student teaching
5408670 but when they leave us and theyre out in districts that may or may not be partners with us we need to understand what the friction is what are the forces that will enable them to enact the ideas and approaches our programs have emphasized and what does it look like as these get transformed because the environment is not totally supportive of these approaches
5408671 we are very interested in how the district context shapes both whats offered for new teachers and how they respond to it
5408672 we have hypotheses about the kinds of supports that are useful a mentor in the same field collaboration with colleagues access to professional development a supportive principal but we also want to get a handle on what supports the different districts think they are providing and why we are also looking at it from the teachers perspective what kinds of supports do they see themselves as actually receiving
5408673 our main interests are in looking at how both their content knowledge for math and the quality of their instruction changes
5408674 well look at teachers who had access to different kinds of resources a mentor with math background more professional development opportunities in the district or they just came in knowing more math to begin with to see how that affects these trajectories
5408675 theres such a press for schools of education to show they make a difference in student learning
5408676 but the measures that are commonly used dont help you make sense of teachers knowledge standardized test scores are not a reasonable proxy for what teachers know we want to dig deeper into what teachers understand and how that may play out in their classrooms what it might look like in terms of student learning
5408677 ultimately we are interested in whether or not theres change in the achievement of students in these teachers classes but were in some ways more interested in how interactions with mentors and colleagues influence student learning by changing both teachers own knowledge of how to teach math and their instructional practices in the classroom we want to understand how different kinds of supports for teachers might be influencing student achievement
5408678 how teachers teach depends in large part on the institutional settings in which they work the schools and districts
5408679 but typically and quite reasonably people in policy tend to ask this sort of question heres a policy mandate a federal law a state law a district law
5408680 were starting from what we know about students learning and teachers instructional practices the teachers learning and trying to figure out what might be important in terms of organizational development

5408682 in february 2005 the colorado house of representatives unanimously adopted a resolution condemning churchill and state governor bill owens called publicly for him to resign for statements he made regarding the world trade tower disaster when a university appointed committee rightly ruled that these resolutions violated professor churchills first amendment right to free speech charges of academic misconduct immediately surfaced from the same and similar sources despite the fact that similar charges had been raised at least two years earlier and were never followed up by the university against this background an inquiry was conducted in circumstances marked by constant inflammatory ad hominem and even obscene attacks on and off the cu campus against professor churchill anyone who appeared to support him and even against some members of the ad hoc investigating committee two of whom resigned soon after the investigation began w e believe that the investigation now is widely perceived to be a pretext for firing churchill when the real reason for dismissal is his politics

5408732 make this screeching cat sliding down a chalkboard sound as if its doing it in an opera house or a theater or a jazz club
5408733 as colleges have become adept at marketing they have transformed themselves from institutions of higher education to branded items
5408734 if an institution has an average sat at one level heaven forbid if it doesnt get at least that next year or its selectivity goes down
5408735 the predictors of a good education are virtually impossible to measure
5408736 when you measure only the things that can be measured your distorting what is important
5408737 also the numbers used are not always accurate theyre fudged
5408738 every institution would like to have more control over what its freshman class looks like
5408739 it used to be that a school would know who its students would be by may
5408740 now you have a situation where enrollments are still changing over the summer
5408741 students ought to pay attention to test scores because they tell them where they might fit in
5408742 if a student is way below the average they will have to do a lot to overcome that
5408743 in the first six months of a pandemic we are dependent on basic public health and social distancing
5408744 it would be a very good idea to stockpile vaccine now
5408745 our studies show that without a lot of antiviral drugs or vaccine or both you dont get anywhere
5408746 the effectiveness of a low efficacy vaccine was somewhat surprising
5408747 clear intensive poultry rearing units from the flyways of migrating birds
5408748 however on the basis of a preliminary risk assessment it has been concluded that a britain wide poultry housing requirement would be disproportionate
5408749 we dont know if this is the first and only bird infected or the twenty first
5408750 an infected bird will be producing millions of virus particles in its droppings which can be picked up by other birds and we should work on the assumption that thats already happened
5408751 we dont know which bird brought it to fife but its irrelevant
5408752 lets make sure that as we move forward now we minimise the risk to domestic poultry
5408753 were moving closer to the day when moving birds indoors will be necessary
5408754 vaccinations a tool we in the bva think should remain on the table it may follow later but not now
5408755 for more than two years weve been monitoring the spread of these viruses in east asian countries and against the background of 5000 outbreaks in birds there have been only 200 cases of human infection
5408756 what makes us alarmed is that more than half of these cases have been fatal but at the present time its very difficult to contract an infection
5408757 most cases can be put down to very close contact with infected poultry
5408758 at least 6 or 7 per cent should be positive
5408759 if you left a swab in the refrigerator in its sheath like that it would dry out and youd lose all your virus
5408760 if you just want to identify the viruses present you could put it in a nutrient solution or in ethanol but you need a transport medium
5408761 a vaccine with a total dose of 180 micrograms would pose a considerable barrier to rapid production of a supply that would be adequate
5408762 fall seriously short of either the letter or the spirit of the law
5408763 it got a huge amount of attention from university administrators
5408764 many colleges think that as long as they let somebody from rock the vote on campus or if they have active college democrats and college republicans that theyre just fine
5408765 but the fact is that 41 percent of college students are independent
5408766 has the lock on the youth vote the polling just doesnt bear that out
5408767 theres a natural resistance to having a bunch of outsiders come to town who dont have long term commitment to the community and voting in local elections

5408790 we started to create funny fresh patterns and use color combinations which were just a bit more daring color was the key basta with the browns green greys blue greys and beiges we used reds greens blues and teals as vivid as the weaving technique would allow and they became our messengers to transmit vitality without being distracting or too loud

5408793 the portion of methane captured over a landfills lifetime may be as low as 20 of total methane emitted
5408794 existing incinerators should be retired and no new incinerators or landfills should be constructed
5408795 wasting directly impacts climate change because it is directly linked to resource extraction transportation processing and manufacturing

5408805 of course but i really want to wipe away all of your little spermies so that they dont get into my pussy i dont think that my mom and dad want me to get pregnant in high school
5408806 do you think that they are going to jump off me into your pussy
5408807 no she said but i want you to put your penis into me next
5408808 i want to feel your cock inside me i dont want to be a virgin any more i want to be a woman
5408809 put it into me for a little but you need to pull out before you come
5408810 this stuff isnt so bad maybe next time well try something else

5408814 for most people especially men a sexual orientation to people of the same gender is not like a coat something you choose after much deliberation parade around in for a while and then stow away for some future season it is something that is built way below the level of awareness starting at an early age and operates at a very deep level within probably indelibly
5408815 while you may feel deeply unsettled about your future you may ultimately be grateful that your fiance told you sooner rather than later he is probably struggling with his own desires and hoping marriage will magically transform his inner landscape it does nothing of the kind more usually it creates heartache in a person who feels completely deceived and rejected
5408816 my foot slipped about half an inch and i felt pain in my back the back of my thigh and my calf
5408817 i twisted to wheel the patient out of the operating room and that was it
5408818 so i researched a bunch of different therapy protocols and found the field of physical medicine and rehab
5408819 i feel its most under control when im staying on top of my workouts running as well as keeping my core muscles strong
5408820 part of the art of taking care of people with back pain is identifying that small group of people who may have something truly seriously wrong
5408821 and for the group of folks who have traditional back pain its helping them to be as comfortable and functional as possible while theyre recovering while at the same time trying to not inappropriately use health care resources
5408822 nine times out of 10 you cannot look at an x ray or an mri or any other test and tell the patient with any absolute certainty why theyre having back pain
5408823 imaging is not indicated in the first six weeks of pain unless you have some suggestions that the person has had trauma has a fever suggesting infection has a major neurologic deficit or has any history of a tumor or suggestive of a tumor such as weight loss
5408824 we try to enable the patient to achieve early success
5408825 we tend to have people do a very high frequency of activity but at low intensity so theyre not provoking symptoms
5408826 if you bend over to reach a box and your leg muscles arent flexible enough to allow you to get there the motion will occur through your spine where it shouldnt
5408827 i said look water takes the weight away you can work your body out and not put that pressure on your spine
5408828 i felt so good last tuesday i got the lawnmower out and cut the grass edged the yard and blew the clippings off the driveway
5408829 ive come a long way thanks to dr rahn and her encouragement
5408830 if you can manage a patient with medications and physical therapy then you dont really need to do an injection but if theyre still uncomfortable and you want to try and calm down the nerve then an injection is a reasonable thing to offer
5408831 if an injectionist does a nerve root block on one level and you dont get any relief but on a different level you do then that can provide some clues
5408832 were very lucky that we have several providers here who can perform this service
5408833 its a very good adjunct therapy to learn how to relax how to cope with the pain
5408834 the mind is a very important part of pain management
5408835 surgery can be very effective for back pain but it needs to be directed to the diagnoses that clearly improve with surgery
5408836 i dont do surgery for back pain i do surgery for spinal instability
5408837 the short term morbidity is dramatically less with minimally invasive procedures the risk of being transfused is less the risk of having a major medical complication is dramatically lower
5408838 were linking up thousands of patients undergoing a certain procedure in the united states and looking at the outcomes
5408839 if there was no other option i probably would have gone that route but not anytime soon
5408840 just thinking about the description of the other treatment theres not a lot of comparison
5408841 im so glad to have gotten it fixed i was just really tired of hurting
5408842 are lumped with those wintering in west africa as a single large population
5408843 it would be complex and expensive for a company to hugely scale up its monoclonal production to treat whole populations rather than a few people
5408844 we can now in principle consider the bird population of europe infected
5408845 i fear it might be endemic in europe by now
5408846 there is a low risk of the imminent arrival of the virus in the uk
5408847 if dead swans in the uk are monitored youll probably find h5n1
5408848 they were most likely infected because they shared water with infected ducks
5408849 some ducks are perfectly capable of picking up the virus then migrating

5408852 etoposide is an excellent trigger of programmed cell death in immune cells
5408853 so our thinking is that these patients with severe h5n1 infection their immune regulation is out of control we are down regulating things to kill off some of the cells to get some kind of balance there is some logic to how this could work
5408854 etoposide is licensed for this indication it is well known the treatment protocol has been used successfully in humans affected by severe virus infections for more than 10 years

5408857 jesus said to her i am myself the resurrection and the life whoever believes in adheres to trusts in and relies on me although he may die yet he shall live
5408858 her point on assumed authority perhaps runs into the criticism noted above
5408859 with all the discussion of the amplified and its seeming favor with women im surprised that nobody mentioned that the translation was originally undertaken by a woman frances siewert
5408860 i have averaged 4 hours a day of serious bible study since 1914 ed 40 years when i was already a theological seminary graduate and yet i am finding daily evidence of the fact that there are countless scripture passages which have been obscure to me until now
5408861 dont ever ever ever use the amplified bible i know that the teacher wasnt scared of charismatics the only thing that i can think of is that some of the glosses provided are case specific and sometimes would provide a pretty skewed translation
5408862 perhaps even to the point of making the reader part of the translation process inasmuch as they are exposed to multiple possible meanings
5408863 believes in adheres to trusts in and relies on me
5408864 but the inerrantists were also anti women so once a belief inerrancy became a litmus test for being on a translation committee womens participation dropped off
5408865 the strategies employed by vms to differentiate their vehicles from competitors as well as within their vehicle line ups are easily achieved through innovative interior trims and lighting
5408866 together with novel interior design interior lighting adds value to the vehicle and the brand moreover interior lighting is of major interest to vms as there is always scope for value addition and improvement
5408867 most innovative lighting applications are often offered as an optional package in the medium and low segments
5408868 however end consumers do not consider lighting a feature that they are willing to pay for when it is offered as an optional package
5408869 the direction we are taking is to have a memorandum of understanding either for the departure of the forces or to have a timetable for their withdrawal
5408870 dont let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya
5408871 the negotiations are still continuing with the american side but in any case the basis for the agreement will be respect for the sovereignty of iraq

5408873 the findings hint at the possibility that life beyond earth may not necessarily use carbon based molecules as its building blocks they also point to a possible new explanation for the origin of life on earth

5408877 doing it the wrong way can also make you feel rotten and unhealthy
5408878 carbs are to this decade what fats were to the last food demons truth is though you need them for energy
5408879 experts suggest a minimum of 130 grams of carbs a day a far cry from low carb diets that start with 20 grams or less
5408880 short term effects of such low carb diets include fatigue constipation and irritability long term you could be putting yourself at risk for heart disease and colon cancer
5408881 fad diets aside what may matter most is how refined the carbohydrates are the best idea is to cut back on refined carbs such as soda and foods made with white flour while loading up on healthier carbs like whole grains fruits and vegetables

5408888 caloric restriction does not mean eating half a hamburger and half a pack of french fries and drinking half of a sugary beverage these people eating less calories have very good nutrition they eliminate calories by eating nutrient dense foods
5408889 if you change the quality of your diet by increasing the servings of nutrient dense food and reducing actually it would be better to slowly eliminate all of the servings of empty calorie foods you improve your chances of living a healthier and longer life

5408894 ive been pitched articles on plastic surgery date rape motorcross racers which all have a place just somewhere else than here scrutiny of recent issues is essential if weve already covered a subject were not likely to want to do so again try to plan ahead of the curve and anticipate the next hot topic
5408895 what id really like to see more of are physical fitness and nutrition articles tailored to teens weve got to help them find creative ways to fight this countrys obesity epidemic
5408896 this is not your mothers cheerleading mag by any means specifically its no longer rah rah girls in skirts its hardcore athletics performed by kids who are exceptional leaders and role models to their peers

5408898 our readers and a large majority of staff writers really respond to hip hop and r amp b stars for example the chris brown ray j omarion and usher cover stories appeared to have a wide circulation however we strive with much desperation to ensure the diversity of gumbo magazine by sometimes straying away from the typical pop culture cover stories
5408899 gumbo magazine is a publication written by a diverse hard working group of teenagers dedicated to growing in the field of journalism while having a little fun in the process for future submissions wed like to see a deeper true focus on the lives of those struggling persevering and surviving under tremendous odds the strive to be the best column of our magazine focuses solely on this area
5408900 weve published reviews of such films as the passion of the christ star wars revenge of the sith pirates of the caribbean ii kingdom of heaven flightplan lady in the water and many others
5408901 music of course is another pop culture topic our readers enjoy
5408902 author elizabeth seaward argued that todays rock and metal music has a negative effect on listeners while classical music has a positive effect many people had strong opinions on the subject and it turned out to become the most popular and controversial article weve offered
5408903 but i think its safe to say most of them resonate with our readers and receive a lot of feedback while we try not to get too sidetracked from our main goal of publishing articles dealing with political and social commentary well gladly publish pop culture related ideas that provide a change of pace examples of topics covered include a discussion of the discovery channel show dirty jobs studies that indicate cursing is becoming more common a christian video game based on the left behind series the death of don knotts the increasing level of violence in movies the comic strips mallard fillmore blondie and the yellow kid santa claus american idol and the quality of recent disney movies
5408904 im going to try to see if we cant shift the attention of the american people from the report on the military situation to a report on the political situation since everybody acknowledges that its the failure of the political arena and the political areas that are the cause of the ongoing violence in iraq
5408905 un biblical worldviews seeing reality as disjointed the gods as capricious and power and wealth as achievable through luck or magic or karma rather than through hard and wise labor and cooperation underlie the poverty of the 3 beisner adds
5408906 the standards of churches charitable giving then are three 1 it should go only to those who cannot support themselves and cannot be supported by their families 2 its aim is to provide food and covering sufficient for basic survival and health 3 recipients must serve the church in return for charity insofar as they are able
5408907 regeneration is the only foundation for social stability and growth quiet private piety that makes no difference in outward behavior and society is
5408908 this is not to say that we should turn people away who are genuinely in need but we should be wiser and more circumspect about how we use gods money we are called to be good stewards with it and not to be accomplices in promoting irresponsibility or in squandering what gods people have provided whatever particular need confronts us in the local church we need to ask ourselves this are we being good stewards with gods money if were not we are in all likelihood following the worn out paths of the secular government or an ill devised scheme of doling out money willy nilly

5408923 we will now try to look at what mutations in the virus improve binding in the upper respiratory tract
5408924 if there had been repeated waves of virus introduced into for example yunnan one would expect multiple sub lineages of the virus but in each place there is only one
5408925 the evidence is now overwhelming that migrating birds can move h5n1 over long distances
5408926 but they are not the scapegoats for maintaining h5n1 within poultry there the cause and solution lies within the poultry industry
5408927 the source of the virus in southern china must be contained
5408928 lets be optimistic that the chinese authorities will accept that this thing is out there it is terribly important to realise that perfectly healthy looking birds have this damn virus
5408929 how did it skip the whole nile delta and get to nigeria
5408930 the cases in egypt make it even harder to say it wasnt spread by wild birds
5408931 just because a bird was carrying h5n1 doesnt mean it died of it
5408932 as the incidents of bird flu on the continent get geographically closer so the level of concern increases
5408933 t cells respond to a much wider range of targets on the protein including regions that are conserved between different strains
5408934 even if i need ten billion viral particles to make a dose of vaccine id still have thousands of doses per litre
5408935 well know it means something if we see it in a cluster of human cases
5408936 from what i have seen of the genetic sequence the italian virus is identical to the one from qinghai
5408937 in greece and italy it is very clear wildlife introduced the virus
5408938 we asked for money for this research two years ago
5408939 there were also no reports of dead chickens in the area and she seemed to have another illness
5408940 we have to look carefully at the victims symptoms and circumstances before we decide
5408941 in the early days of an epidemic when it is not clear whether the virus is in a country or not it is important that tests be completely reliable
5408942 better a little delay than a result you arent sure of
5408943 well only know it means something if we see it in a cluster of human cases
5408944 the problem is that although we suspect that h5n1 mainly attacks the respiratory system we have seen in some species that the virus can cause a more general infection
5408945 awareness of bird flu in humans was very low and considered something that happens to others at the time of the study in 2004
5408946 without knowing whether these people have antibodies to h5n1 you cant really draw any firm conclusions from these results
5408947 the main problem with a follow up is probably the low sensitivity of the antibody test
5408948 becoming resistant to this class of drugs seems to impose a fitness penalty on the virus
5408949 furthermore although the patient with partially resistant virus ultimately received oseltamivir at therapeutic doses and survived both of our patients died
5408950 this frightening report should inspire us to devise pandemic strategies that do not favour the development of oseltamivir resistant flu strains
5408951 when a virus becomes resistant to oseltamivir in theory that virus will be less virulent it wont be as fit
5408952 i dont share that optimism these organisms are fantastically able to adapt
5408953 i think as soon as we apply widespread use of oseltamivir we will start to see resistance developing inevitably and i think we do have to pay attention to drugs other than oseltamivir
5408954 whenever you use any kind of drugs antivirals or antibiotics you expect to see resistance develop finding some resistance is not necessarily alarming
5408955 if we were dealing with a virus of a different characteristic with higher transmissibility between humans we would have first seen more cases among healthcare workers among the playmates of these children more cases in the village than what we are seeing now
5408956 contact between people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their homes
5408957 tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperatures below 4 c
5408958 we are pretty confident that unfortunately it is a human case of h5n1
5408959 and i would have gotten away with it if it wasnt for those meddling kids
5408960 hi im deaf but i can read lips and id like to talk to you
5408961 honey i havent been drinking wine my aunt knows i hate the stuff this is grape juice

5409009 but i dont want to speak english with the press because if you get a word wrong it can make big headlines that happened to me in spain after a real madrid versus atletico match when i wanted to refer to torres and asked the madrid press officer how to say something and he replied tramposo that wasnt exactly what i wanted to say and it caused a tremendous scandal
5409010 some really good football is being played in england at the moment it is the best league in europe but then you have arsenal who play fantastic football and are out of the champions league
5409011 our problem is that we have only 38 per cent of the players there are welsh players irish and scots in spain and italy for example 70 per cent of the players can be called up
5409012 they have implanted this new philosophy a new touch system not only long balls so that is good for english football
5409013 liverpool have never had a player like torres he is playing phenomenally well he could be one of the stars of euro 2008 he is enjoying a very good spell and he is also finishing better than he did at atletico madrid fabregas is a brilliant player he is one of the best midfielders in the world
5409014 they have good players and a lot of quality italy have a good national team and then there is spain i always put them among then favourites they have a great team

5409060 john mccain might be president in six months and whether its his own shaky judgment temperament or just the desire to find a campaign issue this loose cannon is a real threat to this country
5409061 sanchez last night i heard you say that mccain would be in a cone of silence then half hour into the event i hear our guys here at our political desk announce mccain has just arrived at the worship center im thinking hey if he just arrived at the worship center he couldnt have been in the cone of silence right warren well thats true he was in a cone of a secret service motorcade thats exactly for sure sanchez but you said im going to pressure you just a little bit because i love this cone of silence thing we flipped a coin you said and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence thats what you said did you think at the time when you said that did you think he was in the cone of silence did you think he was in the building
5409062 warren actually yes i did there was actually a question i got to senator obama in advance that i didnt get to senator mccain because he wasnt there i actually wrote down on a piece of paper the very first question because i wanted them both to be relaxed i said heres the very first question i gave it to both of them but i also told senator obama since there was one question where i was going to ask for a commitment it was a commitment later about would you allow a presidents emergency plan for orphans i thought if i was going to ask for a public commitment i ought to let him know in advance i got to tell barack obama that in advance i did not get to tell john mccain that in advance it caught him by surprise im sure

5409094 it is vital we do everything we can to keep the british passport a world class trusted and secure document which is why these figures are so welcome
5409095 this report shows even greater progress is being made in the ways the identity and passport service tackles fraud while it continues to give customer service that is second to none
5409096 ips has shown it is a forward looking organisation which is ready to deliver the national identity scheme which starts in november this year with compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals
5409097 i am delighted our annual report shows the identity and passport service is performing so well against its key measures and continues to offer our customers a superb service
5409098 we are better placed than ever to build on our successes in the passport service to deliver the national identity scheme
5409099 i would like to thank all our staff for their hard work over the past year in making ips a success
5409100 i do not know whether the numbers were based on any evidence
5409101 we do not know how many cases actually occurred in china
5409102 if surveillance is done more extensively more cases may be detected
5409103 there are many countries where surveillance is weak and needs to be strengthened i think thats true in certain parts of china as well
5409104 were getting lots of information in a timely way about the outbreaks and were asked to be part of the ongoing investigations i think that speaks for itself
5409105 we are honored to receive this recognition from cnet since it reflects comodos commitment to protect consumers from phishing scams and identity theft

5409107 the prospects for adequate global supplies of an effective pandemic vaccine of any kind are dimmer now than they were last week
5409108 if all the worlds influenza vaccine companies were to produce this vaccine for six months there would be enough to vaccinate only 225 million people
5409109 in our next studies we will try and get lower doses to work
5409110 i dont think we will look at whole virus vaccines
5409111 we used our existing process because it is the fastest way to move to large scale production
5409112 the prospects for developing a pandemic vaccine that can be produced in the quantities the world will demand are now enormously more difficult
5409113 the three cases have been diagnosed as pneumonia of unknown cause but we cannot rule out the possibility of human infection of the h5n1 avian influenza
5409114 if its confirmed as h5n1 bird flu it will certainly be significant but not surprising
5409115 but it would be a symbolic step it shows that china is no different from any other country when it comes to bird flu
5409116 we should concretely enhance our sense of urgency and responsibility in the prevention and control of the highly pathogenic bird flu
5409117 these rumours have been investigated and weve been told by the chinese ministry of health that theres no foundation to them
5409118 it would be a step towards some of the reforms weve seen particularly the bradford x tax

5409142 resq pure energy power drink is proud to sponsor sarah fisher and sarah fisher racing in the 92nd indianapolis 500
5409143 the opportunity to be associated with the second female driver owner team to enter the indianapolis 500 is a monumental event one that we know many sponsors would love to be presented with

5409153 drug delivery is a fast growing and highly dynamic segment of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry
5409154 various factors have contributed to the growth of this area including the poor efficacies of certain drugs patent expirations and the urgent need for life cycle management facing drugs nearing patent expiry
5409155 market participants should focus on developing novel technologies that support the passage of large peptides

5409179 there are new voices in evangelicalism today claiming that a truly biblical christianity demands centralized economic planning and the liberation of the downtrodden masses throughout the world faithfulness to scripture is being equated with a redistribution of wealth notions of social reform once thought to be the province of aberrant liberals may now be heard down the street in the baptist church
5409180 the christian who advocates theft in the name of social justice is in truth calling for the revolution whether or not he fully realizes what hes doing
5409181 fifteen years later however its budget had soared to 180 billion one and a half times more than the total spent by the army navy and the air force in fact
5409182 the typical american who calls himself a christian and who makes pronouncements on economic policies or institutions does so out of an almost complete ignorance of the simplest and most widely accepted tools of economic analysis
5409183 but without showing us exactly how the worlds hungry are to be fed nothing results except the mouthing of pious platitudes and highly emotional exhortations to act such well meaning efforts to help are at best inefficient and wasteful and at worst utterly self defeating and demoralizing
5409184 marxism in the west today has become a potent temptation for gifted forward looking young christians evangelicals among them
5409185 almost without exception the major evangelical books about social justice that have appeared since 1960 have been authored by writers who reject and condemn political conservatism as a cruel heartless and uncaring movement totally out of step with an informed biblical view
5409186 basic to the theory of the evangelical christian who finds liberalism or socialism or even marxism attractive is an appeal to social justice
5409187 owes its immense popularity precisely to its ambiguity and meaninglessness it can be used by different people holding quite different views to designate a wide variety of different things its obvious appeal stems from its persuasive strength from its positive connotation which allows the user to praise his own ideas and simultaneously express contempt for the ideas of those who dont agree with him
5409188 serious questions can be raised about the evangelical liberals grasp of the complex social political and economic foundations of justice the liberal evangelical is often inattentive to important distinction in the notion of justice he fails to see how his claims draw him into an unavoidable and dangerous dependence upon a coercive state he is blind to the fact that many of his preferred programs to help the poor end up being self defeating and he is unaware of the confusion that pervades his interpretation of the biblical teaching about justice
5409189 the only way anyone can know god is from scripture

5409193 should fda drug and medical device regulation bar state liability claims
5409194 the fda simply has more expertise to design appropriate label warnings that recognize legitimate risks without wrongly scaring patients from seeking care
5409195 juries do not have the background or information to change labels
5409196 if every state judge and jury could fashion their own labeling requirements for drugs and medical devices there would be regulatory chaos for these two industries that are so vital to the public health and fdas ability to advance the public health by allocating scarce space in product labeling to the most important information would be seriously eroded

5409198 no easy answers sex offender laws in the united states
5409199 human rights watch shares the publics goal of protecting children from sex abuse
5409200 but current laws are ill conceived and poorly crafted protecting children requires a more thoughtful and comprehensive approach than politicians have been willing to support
5409201 politicians didnt do their homework before enacting these sex offender laws
5409202 instead they have perpetuated myths about sex offenders and failed to deal with the complex realities of sexual violence against children
5409203 the public believes everyone on a sex offender registry is dangerous
5409204 but whats the point of requiring registration by a teenager who exposed himself as a high school prank or even by someone who molested a child 30 years ago
5409205 they simply make it nearly impossible for former offenders to put their lives back together

5409233 there is a long tradition of strong and sustained connections between ireland and australia in the area of geoscience and indeed one of the authors of this map sir frederick mccoy who had worked at gsi went on to become a doyen of australian science later being knighted for his contribution in the area of geoscience more recently the infomar mapping project which provides information on the sea floor around ireland benefited greatly from the expertise of two australian technology companies these links which began many years ago are continuing today and i am confident that they are set to be maintained in the years ahead
5409234 this map is of great historical interest to the people of australia and is part of the fascinating history linking our two countries it is especially fitting that the return of this item takes place during the international year of planet earth

5409237 law school operated an admissions system that gave greater weight to race than the colleges i t is difficult to see how justice oconnor could have thought the law school system passed constitutional muster or that blacks and whites were in any sense on the same playing field in admissions race is obviously given far more weight than all of the other diversity factors together it may be that justice oconnor did not understand that the law school and college admissions policies were functionally identical in their treatment of race o r it may be that justice oconnor cared only about form not substance
5409238 been unable to find a single law school in the united states whose admissions operate the way justice oconnor describes in grutter
5409239 it is a characteristic of legal education as a whole

5409285 these families spend often just a few hours a day sometimes as little as one hour with very small children and the rest of their time is left for them to enrich their lives
5409286 when people can identify something or see it for themselves theyre much more likely to see that as one of their options
5409287 home schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience
5409288 unless we are prepared to keep our children in bubbles their entire lives we have to give them an opportunity to have some exposure to real world problems so they can develop coping strategies
5409289 much of what we learn in life is a matter of interaction i just wonder how that takes place in a home school environment

5409304 the government takes the protection of children and vulnerable adults extremely seriously and the crb plays a vital role in helping us fulfil this duty
5409305 these results are impressive and clearly demonstrate that employers also recognise the importance of crb checks in the protection of the most vulnerable in our society
5409306 last year saw a number of important firsts for the crb in terms of cost performance and customer service
5409307 it was the first year that we were able to freeze our fee levels it was the first year that we achieved over 90 per cent customer satisfaction and it was the first year that we not only achieved but exceeded our targets for issuing crb checks

5409312 this report is an excellent example of what can be achieved when agencies get involved in a collaborative initiative to meet the needs of their customers this type of initiative endorses what the taoiseach said recently in relation to the oecd review of the public service which recommends a greater sharing of information between public bodies working together in this way leads to an improvement of services which ultimately makes a very effective contribution to the infrastructural base of business in the economy
5409313 again i think this demonstrates the acute awareness that the organisation has of who its customers are and what their requirements and expectations are for the future i was particularly impressed by the educational section of the website which recognises the need to nurture even the most embryonic interests in mapping and spatial information

5409427 i am not prepared to tolerate alcohol fuelled crime and disorder on our streets and this new campaign will challenge people to think twice about the serious consequences of losing control
5409428 binge drinking is not only damaging to health but it makes individuals vulnerable to harm people who are drunk are much more likely to be involved in an accident or assault be charged with a criminal offence contract a sexually transmitted disease or have an unplanned pregnancy
5409429 this campaign reinforces government action already underway to deal with excessive drinking including tougher sanctions for licensees who sell to young people new powers for the police to disperse disruptive drinkers and better education and information for everyone
5409430 the consequences of drinking to excess are severe to those young people who become victims of crime incur serious injuries as a result of having drunk too much or commit crime fuelled by alcohol and to those others who do serious and life threatening damage to their own health over the long term
5409431 nationally police forces are taking tough action against alcohol related crime but we cannot simply police our way out of this problem any new initiative which grabs attention and stimulates action by parents local agencies and young people themselves is welcome the know your limits campaign offers better education which can help tackle the problem at its root causes
5409432 were very happy to support this new home office campaign young men and women form the group most likely to binge drink not only does this in many cases lead to involvement in accidents and violence but regular bingeing can also be a precursor to later harmful drinking behaviour its vital that we challenge the attitude widespread among young people that socialising must always involve heavy drinking this will take time but this sizeable campaign is an important contribution to that process

5409454 this is an all too common failure of a government agency to manage its contracts and employees
5409455 any attempt in this case to pillory the contractor just shoots the messenger and ignores the message the census bureau failed to tame an out of control requirements process that churned internally until january of this year those in charge had plenty of warning from us and their own contractor
5409456 they sought bids on a volkswagen beetle and then expected to get a cadillac esplanade it just doesnt work that way and we warned them it wouldnt work at a subcommittee hearing last year
5409457 its going to take a massive amount of effort to have a successful census
5409458 it is past time we do our part to ensure this constitutionally mandated initiative is conducted properly and on time and its time we think about a monitoring board to watch over this agency and its work every day the current level of oversight certainly doesnt seem to be enough
5409459 you can totally legitimately argue that we let slboutique stagnate after we bought it but weve been actively developing the shop onrez service so i dont think that is fair
5409460 i like reading your blog daisy it always makes me laugh but this one had me gritting my teeth im tired of hearing how hard it is for fat women and have everybody ignore how difficult it is for skinny women you seem to think its funny but theres nothing funny about being thin and unable to gain weight
5409461 im not putting this in a comment on your blog because i dont want to get flamed but i honestly dont see whats wrong with a woman wanting to improve herself so shes more attractive to men i had breast implants and liposuction and i work hard to keep myself thin and fit i exercise everyday and never eat junk food i wear revealing clothes to show off my body men think im very sexy and that makes me feel good whats wrong with that any woman who is smart and wants to keep a man will do the same thing instead of whining and complaining about being too fat
5409462 im naturally thin and get tired of being called names like beanpole or people asking me if im anorexic its usually overweight women who ask me those questions and i think its because theyre jealous of me im happy being this way except i wish i had bigger boobs
5409463 as far as marilyn monroe yes i think she was fat she had a gut she was flabby and she wasnt fit or toned shed never make it as a sex symbol today i dont understand why big women always feel the need to bring up marilyn monroe in their arguments about what men consider sexy she was a cow with minimal talent who was popular 50 years ago
5409464 i realize you probably didnt mean to be cruel in your post daisy but you were not every woman thinks being thin is something to joke about women get fat because they cant push themselves away from the table im thin because of a metabolic disorder fat women can change if they really want to i cant you should remember that thin women have body image problems too
5409465 jealousy is an ugly thing im a size zero and believe me when i tell you its not easy i can see the envy in womens eyes all the time and i feel like telling them to toss out the m amp ms and go on a f ing diet just because some women are thin doesnt mean they are bad or unworthy of love or friendship and if little women like me have big breasts it doesnt always mean theyre fake i like your books but i would like them better if the heroines in them were normal thin size like me
5409466 writing about boney assed women when theyre the bitchy antagonists
5409467 i like reading your blog but you have to wake up daisy in real life it is always the skinny woman who gets the hero no man is attracted to fat women unless there is something wrong with him i take pride in my body i keep myself in shape and never allow myself to gain more than two pounds then i drink nothing but water for two days i consider my butt as one of my best features and feel good about showing it off in low rise jeans my d cup breasts are my other best feature and they were worth every cent
5409468 women dont have plumbers butt unless they are fat and fat women shouldnt ever wear jeans most men seem to like looking at female ass cracks as long as the woman is slender and curvy like me i purposely wear low slung jeans for that reason i know theyre looking at me and admiring what they see when i bend over or sit down
5409469 why is it always the thin attractive woman who is the bitchy rival in romances because romance novels are written by fat chicks who have probably never been thin in their lives i think it is very unfair to always make the skinny woman the evil one
5409470 daisy i dont know if youre fat and this isnt directed at you but most fat people disgust me because they are lazy and sloppy ive had the husbands of fat women come on to me many times and i can understand why they do id shudder if i looked like those big assed women
5409471 im in my 20s and i like to get involved with older men in their 40s 50s and even their 60s because theyre grateful to have someone who is thin and young and pretty one of them bought my implants for me as a birthday present the men ive known all take care of me real good because they enjoy being with me instead of their fat wives who always nag at them i like being young and skinny its fun and i would die before i ever let myself get obese

5409478 many adopt the view that the world catches a cold when america sneezes indymac bank failed in california recently and the guardian reported that the british economy is bracing for more turbulence as the credit crisis fallout spreads across the atlantic
5409479 we could however argue that the turbulence started in the uk and spread to the u s the failures of northern rock and bradford amp bingley in the uk came before the failures of indymac and bear stearns the americans might still be ignoring the tottering balance sheets of their banks if the brits had not faced up to their red ink first

5409518 if we are going to continue to allow ourselves the benefits of advances in computing we need to understand power and cooling requirements much better
5409519 scientists from all domains will choose more efficient systems as they invest in new cyberinfrastructure and we expect that greenlight will give them the data they need some scientific computing jobs need more powerful processors some can do with less memory some can use specialized processors these are important requirements to understand so the optimally configured cluster can be chosen and scheduled through virtualization techniques each and every time
5409520 using the sun modular datacenter as a core technology and making all measurements available as open data will form a unique internet accessible resource that will have a dramatic impact on academic government and private sector computing
5409521 by placing experimental hardware configurations alongside traditional rack mounted servers and then running a variety of computational loads on this infrastructure greenlight will enable a new level of insight and inference about real power consumption and energy savings
5409522 we will be running full scale applications on full scale computing platforms so we will be able to draw conclusions about the comparative amount of energy that is consumed by one workload versus another
5409523 we expect that this new approach will re define the fundamentals of computer systems engineering and accelerate adoption of a transformative concept for the computer industry green cyberinfrastructure
5409524 if the networking is transparent the scientists wont care where the computers are as long as the data gets from their devices and back to their screens without delay
5409525 the full scale greenlight instrument will measure monitor and make publicly available real time sensor outputs using a service oriented architecture methodology empowering researchers anywhere to study the energy cost of at scale scientific computing
5409526 its the fastest way to construct a controlled experimental facility for energy research purposes
5409527 computing today is characterized by a very large variation in the amount of effective work delivered per watt depending upon the choice of the architecture and organization of functional blocks
5409528 the project seeks to discover fundamental limits of computing efficiency and device organizing principles that will enable future system builders to architect machines that are orders of magnitude more efficient modern day machines from embedded systems to high performance supercomputers

5409573 often after everyone involved in a conflict has taken an action the outcome of the conflict is still not clear
5409574 the final outcome of a conflict may not be clear after the end of one round of actions this usually happens when either a both sides take a single action and tie or b one or both sides of a conflict take multiple actions but successful actions are split between both sides of a conflict in a such a way that agreeing who got their way is not possible

5409576 we know it works and were not doing it enough because we need funding
5409577 mark lipsey and i began working with wayne county in our preschool curriculum evaluation research pcer grant it was one of seven middle tennessee school systems that agreed to work with us in a randomized control trial comparing the effects of two alternative curricula and a business as usual control group
5409578 our project was one of seven projects funded nationally in the first round of institute of education sciences pcer awards
5409579 in 2004 we worked with wayne county to help them secure a 4 5 million early reading first award from the u s department of education for which we became their evaluators thus we have had a strong and close working relationship with the school system for over 5 years
5409580 for example in the first year of early reading first we discovered that childrens scores in writing were not increasing in the same way as in other areas our classroom data suggested that there was not enough attention to writing in the curriculum
5409581 the immediate response from the program was to schedule professional development for the teachers focused on how to include more opportunities for writing the next year saw a significant gain in the test scores
5409582 we have never worked with a school system more committed to improving the experiences of young children nor any system more willing to engage in and use the results of research to improve practice

5409594 for weeks republicans have been harping on the need to open up additional leases for drilling to lower gas prices and accusing democrats of withholding the needed leases to do that however between 1999 and 2007 the number of drilling permits issued for development on public lands has increased by more than 361 percent meanwhile 10 000 of those leases are not being utilized and instead are being stockpiled by profit rich oil companies the 68 million acres of leased but inactive federal land have the potential to produce an additional 4 8 million barrels of oil and 44 7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day this legislation would nearly double total u s oil production increase natural gas production by 75 percent and put an end to oil companies artificially driving up prices by hording leases it would also cut u s oil imports by more than one third reducing americas dependence on foreign oil

5409672 said rosie blackburn coordinator of the good food on the public plate project 3 at sustain
5409673 however the review says that the scheme will be voluntary and there is no indication of how this will be implemented what training will be provided and how farmers and caterers will be supported to meet this new demand
5409674 the public sector in england should be leading by example more nutritious environmentally sustainable food will be delivered through a new healthier food mark linked to standards for food served in the public sector the standards will help in delivering better food with existing resources the scheme will be voluntary initially and piloted within central government hm prison service and nhs services the government will then consider if compliance should be compulsory in england for central government and for prisons as the scheme progresses all public bodies in england will eventually be encouraged to sign up ensuring a minimum standard of food across the public sector

5409734 the tomato diet boosted the level of procollagen in the skin significantly these increasing levels suggest potential reversal of the skin ageing process this is in addition to the significant reduction in sunburn
5409735 these werent huge amounts of tomato we were feeding the group it was the sort of quantity you would easily manage if you eating a lot of tomato based meals
5409736 people should not think that tomatoes in any way can replace sun creams but they may be a good additive if you can improve your protection through your diet then over several years this may have a significant effect
5409737 eating tomatoes will not make you invincible in the sun but it may be a useful addition to sun protection along with sunscreens shade and clothing
5409738 the protective effect of eating tomatoes on our mitochondria is important as they are the energy producers in all our body cells including skin therefore being kind to our mitochondria is likely to contribute to improved skin health which in turn may have an anti ageing effect
5409739 while the protection offered by lycopene is low this research suggests that a diet containing high levels of antioxidant rich tomatoes could provide an extra tool in sun protection

5409751 le difficolta dei parchi italiani derivano innanzitutto da mancanza di indirizzi generali di strategie territoriali complessive di obiettivi certi stabiliti unitariamente in assenza di questi elementi essenziali discutere del funzionamento dei parchi significa evitare il problema vero che e quello del riconoscimento del loro ruolo nella realizzazione di programmi di sviluppo basati prioritariamente sulla conservazione delle straordinarie risorse naturali che si trovano sui territori protetti
5409752 che pure esiste e deve indurre a semplificare riordinare e svincolare quanto piu possibile le gestioni dagli schieramenti politici un tema reale ma viene dopo scelte generali che nessuna forza politica e nessun governo pu evitare ancora la rivisitazione totale annunciata dal ministro potrebbe essere il passaggio tanto atteso e a lungo rivendicato dal mondo dei parchi se non si accompagnasse ai tagli pesanti inferti dal decreto legge 112 alle capacita di funzionamento dei parchi stessi e se non fosse incentrato su di un aspetto quello dellipotesi di trasferimento della gestione a fondazioni private che al di la delle intricatissime questioni giuridiche che solleva sembra segnalare la volonta di sgravare il pubblico di una responsabilita che invece gli spetta sempre e comunque perche riguarda la pianificazione del territorio e la tutela di beni inalienabili come le acque le foreste le coste la flora e la fauna selvatiche

5409834 asset recovery is critical in the fight against all levels of crime and is one of the governments top priorities for law enforcement
5409835 in february 2008 i announced plans to give law enforcement agencies new powers these include seizing high value goods from offenders on arrest before they have a chance to disperse them widening the kind of assets that are liable to civil recovery and removing the current 12 year limit within which civil recovery proceedings can be taken we aim to include these measures in the forthcoming policing and crime reduction bill as part of the governments legislative programme announced recently by the prime minister
5409836 police forces across the country are making more and more use of the powers to seize assets from criminals and we are seeing the impact this activity is having on crime reduction and community confidence the public are tired of seeing criminals leading lavish lifestyles without challenge all police forces are determined to respond to this and make full use of the available powers granted under the proceeds of crime act and other legislation
5409837 yet again the police performance has far outstripped the challenging targets set by the home office and this reflects the commitment of forces teams and dedicated staff members

5409847 i set up the tackling gangs action programme last september because i was convinced that by focusing our activities on local hotspots we could make progress on an area of crime that devastates families communities and neighbourhoods
5409848 i want to go further and we will be taking forward work to provide witnesses with early certainty that their identity will be protected and that they can give evidence safely stopping guns from coming into the country and providing safe housing and education opportunities for young people leaving gangs
5409849 these early findings are encouraging which is why i want to spread this approach to knife crime and build on what works im determined that we do all we can to get all weapons off our streets and investing 5m today to target knife hotspots across the country i hope communities will welcome the increased use of knife arches and stop and search to protect their young people
5409850 acpo welcomes the home secretarys continued commitment to tackling violent gun and gang crime including the involvement of seconded staff to ensure continued input from police officers with hands on experience of the issues
5409851 the programme provided an opportunity to bring together the good work that has been taking place up and down the country over the period of the programme all areas have seen improvements and the extra resources announced today will help ensure that progress continues thanks are due to the four cities their communities and police forces for their engagement and commitment
5409852 as the only truly universal service for children and young people schools are uniquely placed to spot the early signs of pupil involvement in gangs and to work collaboratively with other agencies to tackle it
5409853 the guidance i am launching today provides straightforward advice to schools about what to look for and how to reduce risks of pupils becoming involved with gangs
5409854 the safety of teachers is crucially important and the guidance is clear that heads and teachers should never put themselves at risk in any way but schools can be an important first line of response helping us to identify those at risk and provide them with the specialist support they need to resist gang culture

5409867 the majority of the discussion fell into a few categories of its own
5409868 the dominant verb for it in the 80s and 90s was impose the new verb for enterprise 2 0 is emerge
5409869 to bring rigorous and relevant research evaluation and statistics to our nations education system
5409870 the gold standard is the randomized control trial rct this is the only class of research design capable of producing adequate evidence for making decisions about the effects of educational practices about policies about programs
5409871 an intervention condition is anything imposed in an education setting that is designed to change the behaviors of the recipients a new curriculum could be an intervention or professional development for teachers any time education scientists propose doing something different from business as usual that is an intervention
5409872 because of its ability to control biases the rct is a gold standard when we want to estimate the causal effect of interventions
5409873 and youre taking out all of the biases that emerge when you let people just choose the condition they want
5409874 you are dealing with children and children are in classes and classes are in schools its not always possible to randomize the kids or the conditions because of basic practical problems like contamination teachers talk materials get shared so it isnt a good idea to randomize at that level
5409875 its become clear that an rct is the best tool for knowing what works it is an important first step ultimately we want to answer questions not only about what works but under what circumstances does it work for whom does it work how does it work and why does it work these questions require additional statistical and research methods within an rct although these methods are no longer considered experimental the answers they produce are important because those are the ones that practitioners and policy makers are also interested in
5409876 dean benbow has been especially supportive of expert including providing tuition and stipends for two of the five years
5409877 ies wanted to know what works for whom and under what circumstances weve added the how and the why questions to that and were creating our program around the methodologies that are necessary to answer those questions our graduates will be right at the forefront of being able to tell superintendents the circumstances under which a given kind of program is effective for what kinds of schools what kinds of teachers what kinds of kids and theyll be able to do that in a way that is state of the art
5409878 people will just do a simple assessment of whether or not the intervention itself is put in place but they dont really check to see if what was put in place actually differs from what was in practice already we need to be much clearer about what to measure in terms of what was actually received by kids in all conditions ies is basically making that a requirement of their research grants
5409879 were trying to develop indices that are as closely aligned with the building blocks theory as possible but were also testing whether or not it matters that you become more and more meticulous and focused on the elements of building blocks or whether you can use indices that are less costly and easier to measure do you get the same set of relationships when you use a simple measure versus a complicated measure
5409880 you cant spend all of your money getting at the nitty gritty details of what transpires in the class you just dont have the luxury or resources for that so you have to have indicators that are well connected but not expensive
5409881 were trying to test whether or not the teachers actually differentiate one of the critical fidelity components in our assessment if student outcomes improve it is important to demonstrate that differentiated instruction also improved otherwise we are still in the dark about the what of our what works claim
5409882 they missed the idea of multiple evaluations using multiple methods to come up with a theory of change
5409883 if you look at the proportion of rcts published in education journals versus others its still a tiny percentage there are a lot of other things that people might want to do in research things people want to know including descriptive research there need to be other mechanisms for that whether through foundations or the nsf rcts frighten people because theyre just so hard to do but they are certainly not the dominant paradigm
5409884 if you want to answer causal questions you need different kinds of methods for answering other questions the people who work in education are doing a fine job the question is is the result of the work theyre doing answering practical questions about how to make the educational experience better for kids thats where the battles get enjoined the nature of the evidence
5409885 most of us around peabody have been talking the same line for years
5409886 across the board the idea of doing well controlled studies of the effectiveness of products and processes and policies is something thats here to stay
5409887 mark and i began working together in our preschool curriculum evaluation research pcer grant seven middle tennessee school systems agreed to work with us in a randomized control trial comparing the effects of two alternative curricula and a business as usual control group
5409888 our project was one of seven projects funded nationally in the first round of ies pcer awards were following these students through third grade and were starting to get their latest scores in now
5409889 you had to have good designs you had to have good ideas but you had to have good designs you had to know something about power something about effect sizes and something about how many subjects you would need to see an effect mark brought this to the table
5409890 one of the things the expert students have helped to do is bring some of that methodological knowledge and consciousness into the department to be a part of teams that include these strong content people expert has brought people together its too complex a world for any one person to know it all so you need to have teams
5409891 the goal of the group experience was for people to take what they learned each day and develop a research proposal they would present at the end of the two week period every day at the end of the lecture people would get together and mark larry and i would help them work through their proposals and apply what they learned at the end of the institute each group gave a one hour presentation and they were great
5409892 they were already either in research groups or companies or the educational regional labs or from universities
5409893 hey everybody were going to play with the blocks today

5409931 so called honour based violence is a heinous crime that has no place in our society i want to help those who fear honour based violence to have the confidence to come forward and report their concerns to the police
5409932 i recognise the scale of the problem is largely unknown since so much of it remains underground but these road shows will help authorities identify the problem more readily helping some of the most vulnerable people in the country
5409933 i will strive to help ensure that victims are encouraged to come forward with the knowledge that they will receive the help and support they need
5409934 all the team at karma nirvana are survivors of forced marriage or honour based violence a forced marriage is a marriage where one or both partners do not consent to the marriage or consent is extracted under duress
5409935 everyone has a right to choose who they marry and when they get married you are not wrong for having made the brave decision to leave a forced marriage
5409936 we are developing a cross government action plan to tackle honour based violence which includes forced marriage honour killings and female genital mutilation
5409937 the plan is being developed with acpo and other cjs agencies and aims to improve the response of police and other agencies to all forms of honour based violence and ensure that victims are encouraged to come forward with the knowledge that they will receive the help and support they need the plan will also address raising awareness and improve training and monitoring amongst communities and professional bodies

5409956 i reverse engineered read basically stole this recipe from a great place in brooklyn called marlow and sons their version of it is one of my favorite desserts ever and i spent a few botched tries sometime last winter trying to figure out how the whole thing worked i still dont know precisely how they do theirs but after many attempts and failures and discouragement and redoubled efforts this is what i came up with which tastes pretty similar to me and which i like just as much
5409957 if youve never made caramel before thats the tricky part because while youre cooking it can be hard to tell what consistency and toughness this molten sugar water is going to thicken into once cooled it took a couple tries for me to develop the requisite zen like calm needed to assess when to remove the caramel from the heat but gradually i discovered that for me five minutes after you add the cream and the butter etc seems about right the finished tart is a great mixture of crunchy cookie crust and ludicrously rich chocolate and caramel and the sea salt is like a surprising exclamation point at the end of everything
5409958 i make this soup often simple really cheap and easy and ive been eating it since childhood
5409959 serves at least 6 hearty filling and good for you too tastes like north carolina
5409960 some people add ginger but im not that big a fan im also not quite sure how youd make a vegetarian version of this soup as the ham is so important to the flavor but id imagine that the right combination of spices could work wonders and its creamy rich texture wouldnt suffer
5409961 my mother used to buy a whole uncooked ham cheap bake it in the oven and then wed eat ham sandwiches etc for a couple of days then when wed eaten the best parts shed put the whole ham in the pot with the other ingredients while the soup was cooking and when it was nearly done remove the ham from the soup trim off some choice bits to add to the soup and throw the rest away you could pretty much get a ham to last all week that way
5409962 weve been getting a lot of bad publicity among methodists because of the presidents position on stem cell research and the like wed gladly arrange for jack abramoffs friends to make a contribution of 100 000 to the church if during your sermon you would say that president bush is a saint
5409963 this parish is in rather desperate need of funds ill agree to do it
5409964 george w bush is a petty vindictive sanctimonious hypocrite and a nitwit
