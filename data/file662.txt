6620002 im glad my duke team doesnt play st marys next year i can tell you that

6620012 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6620013 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years

6620109 the reality is that were focused on the movie games i think there could be a fun mmo for harry potter

6620157 now the aca is very active and i am happy with that especially with the increase in the number of enforcement officers its investigation capacity has also been strengthened
6620158 the increase in capacity has resulted in the agency becoming more active
6620159 what we are seeing at the moment is the result of the aca mounting a closer monitoring than before the arrest of the two perak executive councillors is due to this improvement in the aca
6620160 i know nothing of the arrests i was not informed and its not necessary to inform me i only heard about it in the news it is a matter for the aca to decide not us

6620162 all truly wise thoughts have been thoughts already thousands of times but to make them truly ours we must think them over again honestly till they take root in our experience
6620163 one night bob and i were sitting on the addisons beautiful verandah with our daughter lee and our son in law chef grant we were enjoying the calm garden fountain tossing around ideas for creating a signature egg dish that was deliciously unpredictable and our breakfast in a boat idea was born
6620164 most people love potato skins and the boat represents everything great about them only breakfast style the breakfast in a boat has since become one of the most popular breakfast dishes that the addison on amelia island offers
6620165 i have only be afraid to experiment in both cooking and eating
6620166 the more i try the creations of other cooks the more ideas i get for my own cooking not every dish can be a winner but there are times i learn more from the flops and at least they are always good for a laugh
6620167 no investigation was done simply because no one got in touch with me to take my part of the story no one asked for medical reports
6620168 the state of israel takes any accusations of impropriety at its border crossings very seriously
6620169 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6620170 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6620171 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6620172 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6620173 it hurts my feelings when you call me a baby and that means that i cant trust you
6620174 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6620175 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6620176 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further

6620179 whos that comedian guy with the really buggy eyes that had his own tv show
6620180 we have had just two meetings with representatives of central plains both were instigated by our group
6620181 we found this response not only misleading but clearly biased in favour of the scheme it was also at this meeting that maps indicating that groundwater may rise at least 1m to 1 5m in our area were presented
6620182 we cannot say what the true cost of water is because we do not know what anyone else would be willing to pay what we do know is that treating water as a free good probably leads to a considerable understatement of the economic costs of this project and therefore an overstatement of the net benefits
6620183 i do not think any other economist at this hearing accepts mr donnellys view the costs of transporting the water from some place of plenty and the value to other users of the water currently available is precisely what means water in canterbury rivers is not a free good we also need to consider the opportunity cost of water for in stream uses

6620197 nearly one third of the survey participants reported having experienced some form of discrimination in the workplace with approximately the same amount 31 reporting that they believed they had not been hired for a job specifically because they were transgender a full 15 reported that they had been fired from a job for being transgender with 40 of those people having been fired more than once nearly 10 reported experiencing open blatant discrimination from an employer or prospective employer they were explicitly told that they were being fired or not hired because they were transgender
6620198 youd like to think three games into a season there are some things that you are starting to do better and better and that has not happened
6620199 my biggest failure at this point is not being able to find that nucleus from which you are going to be able to grow from
6620200 were a little bit bigger this year in seeing if we can do fewer things better
6620201 were starting from base fundamentals and technically making sure we got things right before you start growing but i have to feel our base has been elevated substantially from where it was
6620202 it starts with the quarterback because the first thing you cant do is you cant put in anything more than the quarterback can handle
6620203 because if he cant handle it then you have to cut it back as he learns more you can add more
6620204 weve cut back on the volume of things we are just doing fewer things more often
6620205 and i think anytime you have repetition anytime you do fewer things more often usually mentally you put players in a position where okay i know what to do now i just have to go out and do it
6620206 if youre going to change your thought methodology on the volume of pressures youre going to put in you only can practice so many things in a practice so i think you have to pick your poison as far as what you want to get done

6620223 we were hoping it would pull through i was talking to my wife we wanted to adopt it
6620224 what do you think someone who would do that to an animal would do to a person
6620225 it really disturbs me right now with all the people on silver spring leaving
6620226 if we play our cards right we can easily piggyback off of bayshore
6620227 if we stand idly by and fail to improve our business district
6620228 could be a real cool eclectic complement to the more mainstream retail in bayshore
6620229 it was sleepy when i got here seven years ago
6620230 we have done well in delivering more than 30 of our communications systems to the government over the last three years and we have orders for 20 more to be delivered in the next six to 12 months
6620231 one of the reasons we selected colorado springs for this operation is that the reasonable cost of living here makes it easy to attract the people here that we recruit nationwide especially since many of them have a military background
6620232 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6620233 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6620234 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6620235 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6620236 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6620237 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
6620238 hopefully greg can set the tone for us the first day
6620239 we started out a little flat but manny seemed to pick us up with that stolen base
6620240 it just seemed like we were waiting for something to happen we got a lift on the stolen base but we also got a giggle out of it
6620241 juan pierre told me to run if i wanted to
6620242 when we were putting him on the dl i think he realized the time of the year
6620243 he said just throw me out of the bullpen i said lets get well first and then well talk about that
6620244 oh yeah good choice why didnt we think of that
6620245 an elevator shaft is a typical example of a shear wall retaining wall s as a whole structure tend to rely a lot on gravity and soil resistance to properly function compared to shear wall think of shear wall as multiples of columns placed next to one another continously they acts as stiffeners apart from carrying load they resist lateral drifts of a building
6620246 ausdrill is in its best ever financial and operational shape and is positioned to continue its strong performance for the foreseeable future he said
6620247 all of our core divisions made positive contributions to the record profit with strong performances in both australia and africa
6620248 ausdrill is well placed to capitalise on the unprecedented demand for mining industry services globally
6620249 its kind of the way its been happening for me this olympics
6620250 this olympics is the jamaican olympics no disrespect to the americans
6620251 dominating like we are its no surprise i know its been crazy because weve been on the podium a lot
6620252 they brought their a game i dont know where we left ours its packed somewhere in my suitcase i forgot to dig it out weve got to go find it though
6620253 this is not the team usa we know were a much better team than this flat out
6620254 if youre going to point the finger just point them at me
6620255 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay
6620256 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6620257 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities
6620258 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6620259 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6620260 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low
6620261 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed
6620262 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6620263 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie
6620264 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6620265 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar

6620290 john mccain couldnt answer a question most americans would find simple how many homes do you own
6620291 just as obama has begun to stress a more populist message he heard news today of an inadvertent and totally unexpected assist in making his point from john mccain in mccains response to a simple question
6620292 rapid response ad suggesting obama purchased his home in a deal with a shady chicago influence peddler
6620293 the mccain camp was quick to point out that obamas one home sits on property he received help in financing from political fundraiser tony rezko who has since been indicted for corruption
6620294 obama made 4 million last year and is in no position to complain about mccains wealth
6620295 except that even by mccains own definition 4 million would not make obama rich
6620296 i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6620297 kerry gaffes in front of the press but they dont notice only fnc covered kerrys 87 billion flub the day he said it

6620301 were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyone has seen for a long time chief executive greg goodman said
6620302 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6620303 what weve decided to do is to reduce the distribution payment policy to 75 of operating income for the 08 09 financial year and well also change the frequency of the distributions to six monthly mr goodman said
6620304 so were going to retain 25 of the earnings and they will go into long term and shareholders growth and obviously very sensible capital management
6620305 theres no need to raise any capital mr goodman said given that the group had about 2 5 billion in liquidity and assets
6620306 there have been some rumours for quite some time about different groups going to the market for capital mr goodman said a corker too dear to drink
6620307 i feel sorry for people who dont drink when they wake up in the morning thats as good as theyre going to feel all day

6620309 the australian market for transport fuels and convenience retailing will continue to grow and caltex is well positioned to capture future market opportunities managing director des king said
6620310 refiner margins are expected to be volatile but remain robust overall
6620311 continued strength in diesel and jet fuel margins will likely compensate for the expected weakening in petrol demand mr king said
6620312 caltex recognised early in 2008 the possible negative impact of rising crude oil prices and reduced petrol demand caused by the us economic slowdown and took measures to respond to these challenges mr king said
6620313 sales of regular petrol eased in line with the overall market but caltex outstripped the market in growth of diesel jet fuel and higher margin premium petrol sales mr king said
6620314 lubricants sales volumes and margins increased as did margins for specialties mr king said
6620315 exceptionally strong for diesel and jet fuel due to high demand in asia which had helped offset weaker margins for petrol driven by the us economic slowdown
6620316 caltex remains committed to a conservative balance sheet and will continue its focus on good cash management mr king said a corker too dear to drink

6620319 there is a lot of concern over how slow it is going
6620320 we really need the same level of functionality in network infrastructure to make it departments jobs more feasible and ultimately this has to come from the vendors
6620321 china for example is one of the biggest users of ipv6

6620333 i dont know what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all out world war iii
6620334 look weve wasted our troops theyre wounded and not getting cared for theyre dispirited and tired if you really want to continue this insanity like following bin laden to the gates of hell youll have to reinstate the draft because you just dont have enough young bodies to throw into the fire
6620335 the committee pored over thousands of records and every claim of a sighting no matter how outlandish
6620336 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6620337 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6620338 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law
6620339 i did not have people coming to me saying you must support this industry
6620340 on the contrary i was overwhelmed with people suggesting that this is not compatible with the aspirations of this community
6620341 i came to the conclusion that it was time to make a stand and ask the government to also make a declaration that they would protect the community
6620342 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
6620343 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6620344 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6620345 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6620346 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6620347 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6620348 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6620349 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6620350 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density

6620352 wireless radios dont work together in fact they fight each other

6620354 also joining the request were the new york times the washington post situation publishing ltd the reporters committee for freedom of the press and the computer amp communications industry association
6620355 the news outlets and advocacy groups said that non confidential public records in the case have been sealed unnecessarily and unjustly withheld from the public
6620356 for example the organizations said court filings that detail allegations of intels behavior toward computer manufacturers have been redacted even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive disadvantage
6620357 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them the organizations said
6620358 i think the issue is due to the candidate and the fact that not all of the body supports that candidate for instance francis slay
6620359 the difference between an insurgent and an iraqi civilian is whether they are dead or alive
6620360 if you kill a civilian he becomes an insurgent because you retroactively make him a threat

6620366 congratulations brett on coming to new york welcome he wanted to play ball the big apple
6620367 for me this is the third preseason game and we have to show vast improvement from the second preseason game and that is what i am focused on
6620368 its one game thats actually closer to a real game so it will be interesting regardless
6620369 i guess there are going to be a lot of 4 jerseys
6620370 i heard he is the number one seller again hey its jets and giants cant get no better than that the city loves it bragging rights
6620371 id like to see what its like the feeling the excitement the buzz its a great thing i had chills on my body and i wasnt even part of the team hopefully one day those feelings can actually be real thats where we want to be one day
6620372 they had a great run it was something to watch it was cool to see a team come together like that
6620373 to see them as underdogs and perform the way they did it was a real eye opener i was amazed by how they played
6620374 they got to the super bowl and they got a chance to do it and they succeeded which is good for those guys
6620375 thats where i want to be ultimately im sure a lot of people feel the same way i know those guys personally see them every day and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth
6620376 adding brett favre two weeks into training camp has been a unique situation
6620377 we have made every effort to be honest and transparent
6620378 people need to be responsible for themselves and their children
6620379 dont you go shopping at bicycle stores in the spring

6620382 well that is our job we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
6620383 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt
6620384 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6620385 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6620386 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression in fact the study found that quality of life was actually lower in the women taking hormone therapy in the first few months of commencing treatment
6620387 if they want him jerry out ill vote for him but if they want you april out i have to vote with the house or ill be a target

6620393 the most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart
6620394 we are pleased our clients have the certainty of a favorable resolution to this unprecedented liquidity crisis
6620395 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6620396 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said
6620397 there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair
6620398 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
6620399 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6620400 i think it would be cool to play in the world series of
6620401 it may have been much tougher this time due to the improvement of the asians and especially china but we once more met this goal
6620402 in some events we did very well and in some events we didnt do so well but our expectations were to claim one medal and reach between six and eight finals and i think we will be close to that
6620403 of course there was a sense of disappointment in some of the events but overall around 50 percent of the athletes performed as we predicted
6620404 our medal favorites ram and erlich zeevi and gal and kliger didnt succeed and obviously that caused a sense of disappointment but our country is one which swings rapidly from black to white and from euphoria to depression
6620405 the sporting infrastructure is in shambles and the different clubs are collapsing
6620406 the oci protects the top athletes the best it can and they did their best but you cant always succeed
6620407 we did well in certain events the sailing competitions went very well and so did the swimming in the artistic gymnastics we also succeeded we have no regrets about any of the athletes we sent as they all met very tough criteria
6620408 this is also a changing of the guard delegation some 23 of the 43 athletes are under 23 years old and thats an amazing fact
6620409 this means we have a young group of sportsmen which is replacing the older generation and this group will blossom in london 2012

6620416 if the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of government
6620417 institutions engaged in matters of high public interest or performing public functions are by virtue of the nature of the functions performed by government agencies activities which are too fundamental to the society are by definition too important not to be considered government functions
6620418 she becomes the metaphor for the questioning attitude of the modern woman
6620419 we wanted to advertise in newspapers but the costs were prohibitive hence we hit upon the idea of advertising about the army in school college notebooks and answer sheets the concept was implemented from the current academic year
6620420 evangelicals historically have been at the forefront of every important social movement in america including abolition womens suffrage child labour laws the civil rights movement and welfare reform
6620421 clear the air talks have taken place it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6620422 i can confirm that we had a friendly and positive meeting and were moving forward
6620423 uhh you guys all have a reflex defense of 97 right
6620424 thats not right beholders dont even have that many eyes

6620429 england versus the rest of the world game which might be an even contest if it were cycling but at football it resembles a massive mismatch
6620430 genius strategist to re configure their midfield a mess against ujfalusis team
6620431 balance in the way they are set up although he is too mindful of the difficulties of capellos job to repeat such a critique in public
6620432 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus the portsmouth manager said
6620433 we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6620434 at the moment the liverpool potential transfer situation means he is not at his best capello observed barry can be forgiven an off game he remains an important player for england
6620435 they played for the first time without fear at wembley said capello of his players adding that international football was more demanding than the premier league or champions league because
6620436 the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every saturday and sunday redknapp added
6620437 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy what i think is the problem is you get people who play for their clubs and they are loved they play for chelsea like frank lampard and the fans idolise them
6620438 they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people
6620439 footballs like life its about confidence if you have no confidence its very difficult they come out here and make a mistake and they know theyre going to get slaughtered at every opportunity and they just dont perform
6620440 beckham played not only because he can take set pieces and free kicks but because he plays well stressed capello sounding alarmingly like sven goran eriksson
6620441 i have a lot of confidence if only his players did if only the fans did
6620442 awful match that should lead to bob bradley being fired
6620443 a good win a scrappy win good show of heart and character
6620444 it was a very hard fought game and for us a hard earned three points the win is based more on the determination of our team sometimes its necessary to win games in that way it was a game where we relied on the effort team spirit and the mentality of the group our experienced players have made the point to the team that qualifying is always difficult away from home you have to expect games to be very tough we have played some tough games in the last year but none of them are qualifiers to experience it and to win in that fashion is good for the group
6620445 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6620446 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6620447 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6620448 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead
6620449 over 44 percent of the bankers reported that consumers as a result of higher energy prices were encouraged to shop locally slightly less than 12 percent disagreed with this linkage
6620450 when i crossed the line i thought this is the biggest thing in my sport and i didnt enjoy it
6620451 this is an area not well handled in the past
6620452 we do know it is a very big issue especially for athletes retiring who can suffer long term considerable downs
6620453 it is difficult i can see how athletes suffer from depression you spend the last 12 to 13 years of your life preparing for an olympic gold medal and when it stops it is a hollow feeling
6620454 softball is a big part of our culture we spend a lot of time together and we email phone talk all the time it is important to have that support for our sport its a good thing

6620496 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt

6620510 gene blazed the trail he stood his ground for the players whether it was popular by public opinion or not
6620511 there was a quiet pride we all felt when gene accomplished what he did because it set a tone you can do whatever you want to do with hard work
6620512 his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6620513 it has been because of gene upshaw that there have been so many benefits accruing to the players that they might not have gotten with a more adversarial relationship
6620514 he did a wonderful job for the current guys but not for the guys who built this league he came into the league as a player he went into the union and he never left the game i dont think he really had a feel for what was going on
6620515 with the two guys we had involved in different issues off the field chris henry gene was always very concerned about them and what he could do personally to help them to sit them down and confer with them and get them to understand why they were in the position they were in and what could he do to help them i found gene to be just tremendous
6620516 god only knows what gene knew and when he knew it because he never told anyone anything he was a heroic kind of character outsized you felt privileged to be his friend

6620591 now it is very clear that there is a drive for cha cha and the administration is using mindanao issue to justify it
6620592 she wants lasting reign and lasting power not lasting peace arroyo has clearly used the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad as a trojan horse to subvert the senate as a stronghold of the political opposition and open the floodgates for charter change arroyos peace rhetorics have been unmasked anew she has employed duplicity in the government of the republic of the philippines grp s negotiations with the milf to cater to her own desire for political perpetuation
6620593 this is peddled by this same government that fails its negotiations with the milf this would be the same government that has been engaged in an all out war policy against the moro people ultimately this will be the same government responsible for aggravating the country into critical level of poverty economic and political hardship due to corruption and repression
6620594 it is a big shame that arroyo and her cohorts are trampling the noble aspirations of the mindanao peoples for just and lasting peace in order to further her self interest we deplore this move by arroyo and we call on our mindanao legislators to hear the voice of the people in mindanao we want authentic peace not charter change

6620607 though rise does not keep up with the ins and outs of politics he says he is tired of what he sees as
6620608 but im changing my scene and im doin the best that i can
6620609 me and any one of my friends would have this knocked out in under three minutes guaranteed
6620610 i would terribly miss that gappy smile if i never saw you again
6620611 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6620612 even if you have to sit together for a week
6620613 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent

6620618 no we wont bring our boyfriends back to the dormitory
6620619 why this is our dormitory my mirror was broken and her gel got ruined only we 3 are living here i would like to know if anything wrong has happened to you
6620620 so who did that you know it shouldnt be me jenny or even you
6620621 but it has influenced jenny and i and this is not a private area i am not into your personal stuff ok if you think i hurt your friend here is my sorry but he shouldnt be doing things like this
6620622 look today i got to know my ex bf is right now in shanghai he is very sick right now i tried to find someone new to make me forget about him
6620623 ok listen i have seen many people like that are you truly aware of the fact that you know him very well
6620624 she started to open her eyes wide and calmed down to listen
6620625 ok then i dont need to worry about that because i truly know that he is not right for you under any condition
6620626 from our observation we think he is not a good person for you i just didnt want you to get hurt ok you want to find someone to replace your ex no problem but he should be a good one could you choose a good one for yourself does he truly make you happy
6620627 yes when i am with him he can make me happy
6620628 ok great then i have nothing to say as long as you feel happy this is very important thing
6620629 i felt very warm inside when you said that but i knew when we were out in the street he could get mad with others very easily but he can always turned his face to me with a smile i told him to be patient and he listened to me he also told me that he grew up in an enviornment of discrimination since he is indian american so he knew he is not perfect and there are a lot of things for him to work on
6620630 that is great as long as he could realize that he could be changed
6620631 so since we had this open talk and i knew i had to talk to you like this in person cause i dont like to talk behind others if you wanted to bring him here no problem i had no problem since jenny hasnt experienced this before so this could be a bit hard for her
6620632 he told me he would take a revenge on you so i am worrying when he is coming again he would do anything bad to you
6620633 look at what he did today for jennys stuff this is sick it is enough for you to abandon him
6620634 i wanted to but i am afraid he would take a revenge on me i know he is not the one for me and i wanted to break up with him
6620635 that would drive him crazy he would think that it is me who made you two break up
6620636 this friend could be this optimistic a good paragon for me to learn from

6620670 if you care about protecting a womans right to choose and preventing the supreme court from becoming even more of a tool for right wing ideology
6620671 then barack obama is your candidate and must be president
6620672 but shes here and hes there so it doesnt seem likely

6620705 i know you think what you did is right but killing people is never right
6620706 for a very small handful of people with adhd it may actually be a replacement for stimulants but for most its complementary something they should absolutely do along with taking meds to help increase attention and improve mood
6620707 exercise turns on the attention system the so called executive functions sequencing working memory prioritizing inhibiting and sustaining attention
6620708 on a practical level it causes kids to be less impulsive which makes them more primed to learn
6620709 the refrain of many adhd kids is no matter what i do im going to fail
6620710 rat studies show that exercise reduces learned helplessness in fact if youre aerobically fit the less likely you are to learn helplessness
6620711 when you increase dopamine levels you increase the attention systems ability to be regular and consistent which has many good effects
6620712 get your child involved in something that he finds fun so he will stick with it
6620713 a very good thing for kids and adolescents with adhd
6620714 the result is that kids realize they can regulate their mood and attention through exercise
6620715 i tell my patients that there are two things they need to do for their health and consume omega 3s

6620718 the role of nutrition in the treatment of any chronic condition is important
6620719 the biggest challenge is to get my daughter to eat protein
6620720 patients who did not receive the therapy lost most of the positive effects of treatment one week after they were taken off medication
6620721 after the year of neurofeedback therapy some patients were able to reduce medication dosage by about 50 percent
6620722 the brain emits different types of waves depending on whether we are in a focused state or day dreaming
6620723 if i had a child with adhd i might use neurofeedback as one part of the treatment regimen
6620724 but i wouldnt use it instead of other treatments that are better supported by research
6620725 asking if you should use medication or a complementary therapy to treat attention deficit disorder add adhd is like asking whether you should eat fruit or vegetables
6620726 parents of adhd children are always looking for ways to help them
6620727 adults with adhd are also very self motivated in finding ways to deal with symptoms
6620728 all of this is well and good to know but how does it work in the context of an actual gaming group

6620891 as school board members and their county board colleagues prepare for a sept
6620892 thats what architect and county government consultant roger lewis said should be the final outcome of the wakefield design process speaking during an aug 19 work session with county board members
6620893 the work session was designed to prep for the conference with the school board as both sides stake out positions on the design of wakefields reconstruction it gave county board members both an overview of general design concepts and specifics on the wakefield site
6620894 beth wolffe who chairs the schools committee of the arlington county civic federation and is a former school board candidate had a different take on the new process
6620895 wolffe voiced concern that in their zeal to create a visual statement self appointed county architectural gurus may forget the main purpose of the school
6620896 the schools current cost is estimated at upwards of 170 million but could run to more than 200 million if spending gets out of hand or construction costs continue to soar making the wakefield project twice as expensive as the reconstructions of yorktown and washington lee high schools
6620897 how much extra is the county board or school board prepared to spend for what this architect calls civic charisma
6620898 if its cheap fine if its another 5 million thats not so good

6620915 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief
6620916 hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
6620917 it is quite foolish to think that one attribute of god his love can trump his holiness or his righteousness or his justice
6620918 father forgive them for they know not what they do
6620919 he saved others let him save himself if he is the christ of god his chosen one
6620920 if you are the king of the jews save yourself
6620921 do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
6620922 truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise
6620923 father forgive them for they know not what they do
6620924 is this not contrition born from a heart that is under conviction and is repenting
6620925 this is a recognition of christ as lord for he understood that he was indeed the king of gods kingdom
6620926 god is faithful he saves all of his people by grace through faith which is a gift from the father no one can work for it or deserve it the abomination of easy believism part 3 the way of salvation
6620927 the abomination of easy believism part 4 the real god of the bible
6620928 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
6620929 oh baby i feel so down when you turn me off when i feel left out
6620930 god delivered them from their distresses because they cried out

6620936 changes in the game just since i played have been substantial
6620937 back then high school players never heard of summer football camps the reads quarterbacks and receivers have to make in the wide open passing attacks we have now were also well in the future
6620938 is a lot more sophisticated theres more mental stuff than there was back then
6620939 i was an option quarterback mostly in the wishbone and didnt throw much we did a lot in spring training and maybe a few things in a voluntary summer gym program but if there were specialized summer camps like college coaches run now i never heard about them
6620940 it was held in late june or early july and was helpful and affordable for high school players here in austin but it wasnt specialized
6620941 everybody in it backs linemen whatever all did the same things lifting and running
6620942 players in general seem to be a lot bigger now than they were then
6620943 somebody 6 foot 3 and 230 pounds back then was considered big now almost every high school team has several that height or taller and 250 or heavier
6620944 every major change in the rules has benefited the offense theres more holding allowed
6620945 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6620946 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6620947 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6620948 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6620949 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6620950 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6620951 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential
6620952 i love the new method aroma sprays i remember you said you dont know what the point of the ring is but i knew exactly what to do i got home and hung it on the hooks i bought from ikea its perfect
6620953 i believe the rigor of our advanced placement classes plus the dual enrollment college courses and honors classes available to whs students are essential to increasing students readiness for college
6620954 we are always looking for ways to increase students academic and career opportunities
6620955 i am proud of how hard teachers and staff work to provide enriching experiences for our students
6620956 it starts from the elementary level and continues through middle and high school so that everyone in the school system is responsible for our students successes
6620957 i act with purposeful awareness of peace in every moment

6620966 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out

6620969 my killer is loretta and she lives across the street
6620970 why of course there is so much more i could have done if theyd let me
6620971 its the order we are looking to use this week we will be looking to matty to put the afterburners on and we will respond to what we see
6620972 its a matter of how far he goes al has performed really well for us and we know he is capable of going the distance
6620973 matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt so that serves us well this week
6620974 its going to be dry its going to be fast so that order serves us well
6620975 he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6620976 its good to have him back but most importantly its good for him
6620977 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6620978 he is a point of difference we have versatility in the mix
6620979 and in terms of covering full back ryan will do that
6620980 ah youngsters if only you love biology you will not loss your job
6620981 hoping some years later the genes new edition will publish new findings of you
6620982 its true that we need to work with the game its owners and key commercial partners to ensure players like greg inglis stay in rugby league
6620983 like everyone greg will look at his options after this contract
6620984 we are hopeful people associated with rugby league can put together a package for greg to be suitably remunerated in the game
6620985 it was a very hard fought game and for us a hard earned three points the win is based more on the determination of our team sometimes its necessary to win games in that way it was a game where we relied on the effort team spirit and the mentality of the group our experienced players have made the point to the team that qualifying is always difficult away from home you have to expect games to be very tough we have played some tough games in the last year but none of them are qualifiers to experience it and to win in that fashion is good for the group
6620986 our effort is to spend it sooner rather than later
6620987 by this time next year all five rail lines 2 billion is going to be in play
6620988 when 10 000 people go to work what else do they need they are going to spend whatever money we give them to spend and spend it again
6620989 if youre an economist and you look at that the economic impact is going to be immense
6620990 it is encouraging to see air pacific achieve this milestone and with a seat factor of 72 per cent for the month whilst some flights may have been full

6620993 the psc has not dropped investigations yet but said they will inform me in due course and asked me to take up office in the meantime since its an important position
6620994 this shouldnt be a deterrent for you and i urge you to carry out your duties with honesty and good faith

6621002 getting ready for the launch we did massive amounts of performance testing built capacity model after capacity model and yet with all of that you threw so much traffic our way that we need to add more capacity
6621003 the argument behind the business model is these are functions you dont need 100 percent of the time if you have full staffing of those functions you need to pay for the infrastructure
6621004 vista amp seinfeld not that theres anything wrong with that
6621005 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6621006 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6621007 oohhh poor me i hate rushing to a massage life is just awful its not fair
6621008 hello my name is mohammad nice to meet you follow me this way
6621009 greetings assholio im going to fucking snap your neck lets go tart
6621010 bobs response was to tell peaches this is your mess you made it you clear it up
6621011 its fairly typical of his approach to parenting and while it may leave something to be desired you cannot accuse him of being inconsistent its the same with all the girls
6621012 ever since paula died bob has found it incredibly difficult to give them boundaries he lives in fear that if he stifles them too much theyll end up going off the rails like their mother did
6621013 i used to admire him for being brave enough to trust his kids but now im not so sure its not just peaches all the girls have been damaged by losing their mum and im worried it will all end in tears
6621014 peaches has never been someone who likes to be controlled so when bob laid down the rules she was angry but she knows that there is nothing she can do
6621015 bob is one of the most trusting parents and peaches knows that which is why she feels that she has let him down even more whats harder for her to digest is that she will have to cut off all her mates who she has met recently because bob sees them as a bad influences
6621016 she is not allowed to dj for a while or go to many parties because he is worried that she could be led astray again
6621017 her cash and credit cards have been taken away so she now has to ask him for money to do anything when she does she will face a grilling over what she needs the money for its going to be pretty hard for her to deal with but her main concern is making it up to her dad because deep down she knows he is only doing all this because he loves her
6621018 okay this is now crossing the line and as a parent i have to set boundaries
6621019 and fred was withering about her showbiz lifestyle he hated drugs and used to tell her she was a wannabe who should start doing something worthwhile with her life
6621020 it was tough love but he was right and she responded brilliantly to it but in the end he grew tired of her spoilt ways and dumped her
6621021 why dont you make sure you have enough film in your camera before making me start talking
6621022 were very anxious to get on the field to be ready to get on the field friday all of us feeling good about it
6621023 i just felt like that was the place for me
6621024 i felt right at home so i just went ahead and made the decision to get it over with
6621025 our expectations are not to just go to the playoffs again but to get the ring this year
6621026 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6621027 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6621028 multiple preliminary offers from private equity firms and strategic buyers
6621029 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6621030 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6621031 so they asked his staff and he said at least four
6621032 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6621033 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6621034 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience
6621035 so this race is very much up in the air and up for play
6621036 is there another k that i do not know about
6621037 both the fantasy and zodiac lines have been canceled fantasy is what the dragons line evolved into basically and the dragons line has been cancelled as well the company is focusing on licensed products for right now
6621038 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6621039 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6621040 of course there were heated debates on the phone but no one attacked publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year the last game of the season
6621041 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why would you turn your back on a contract business is business
6621042 its more the conditioning factor of starting and stopping and getting in the huddle and doing all that we have plans to do some extra things with him even when were not practicing
6621043 taking a lot of hits you never know if you can jeopardize it
6621044 the only safe bet to not signing a new deal right away is staying out of harms way
6621045 some people dont agree and some people do agree and thats just what it boils down to during a holdout before i made the decision to hold out i took that into consideration
6621046 you do not get a 200 move down in gold and 7 move down in silver in a month because they were supposedly in a bubble and then after everyone and his mother is selling you find it almost impossible to find any actual gold or silver to buy at major dealers across the country hundred ounce bars on ebay are changing hands at 17 per ounce more than 4 above the spot price that is a heck of a lot closer to the market price than 12 68 spot which is what the screen says right now but where you can not buy a single ounce of physical silver after this display anyone who uses the paper markets to invest in gold and silver is just a dummy and deserves what he will eventually get nothing how speculators can continually line up leveraged positions against bullion banks with unlimited cash backing which in turn repeatedly smack down the markets is a mystery

6621050 not necessarily i think i try to pay attention to applying resources in the most efficient or effective manner
6621051 i suppose you would think that could be considered fiscally conservative and there are areas that i have been but there are other areas i havent been
6621052 as long as you can properly evaluate players and macphail feels comfortable with those evaluations hes going to do whatever he can to give you the financial support to sign those players
6621053 i think thats been the process since hes been here
6621054 i didnt really know how to react but i felt like what was done was done and we had drafted two very talented players one of them arguably the best player in the draft
6621055 i was concerned but i was really just curious as to how he would handle it
6621056 this year and last year the idea was to make an investment in the infrastructure
6621057 we did reduce what the major league payroll has been and we have been able to put that money in the infrastructure
6621058 as a club its easy to spend a couple extra million for draft picks opposed to what it costs in major league free agency
6621059 all of a sudden the risks look more attractive even though the odds are such that the vast number of players in the amateur world wont work out
6621060 i wash my self with a rag on a stick

6621064 this kind of spike in demand is something no one can foresee
6621065 and no business runs itself waiting for this to happen
6621066 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6621067 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6621068 until the u s mint can supply us with more coins we wont be able to supply any to our customers
6621069 nobody has the eagles or the buffaloes right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
6621070 this kind of spike in demand is something no one can foresee and no business runs itself waiting for this to happen

6621140 i make this statement and people who know me will know it is true you dont have to agree with somebody about everything to respect them what gene did as a player and what he did as the president of the players association to bring that union to where he brought it with nfl ownership where he was able to stand up for the players to get his demands answered he had the guts to do it a lot of people wouldnt have done it
6621141 it was irresponsible and shows how dumb ditka is i didnt just come to this rodeo ive been doing this since 1983 when did he start last year mike ditka just runs his mouth he doesnt want to know the facts
6621142 my disagreement with gene and the players association came down to one thing which was the disability program and the lack of respect for the former players thats all it came down to optometrist
6621143 i dont know how the same pass the same situation

6621187 the liberals say they want to face me at the next election
6621188 when they say that you know it is exactly the opposition
6621189 but people can see what we are doing on water and can see what was not done by the other mob
6621190 the point of the matter is that it winning the election will be very difficult and i said that at the party conference last weekend
6621191 do i have fears about that no because i think we have been doing a good job
6621192 ultimately people are going to look at a whole range of factors
6621193 one thing i am doing at the moment is running a taxi meter on the liberals promises and they have been promising everything to everyone
6621194 creemos que esto consolidar a la psp como un dispositivo comunicacional viable
6621195 theres still a significant amount of cars that are being sold
6621196 theres definitely been a dramatic shift in the last six to 12 months and the car industry needs longer than that to plan for the future
6621197 we are making the right decisions and bringing the focus in 2011 is the right decision
6621198 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined

6621201 we are hoping the pain he caused will be relieved soon
6621202 the stain and hurt is really starting to take effect on creditors
6621203 this is just not fair and people are losing out
6621204 at the moment the creditors are hopeful but they are not confident about getting the money they are owed
6621205 i am struggling to find words for the numbness and traumatic feelings the murders caused the family
6621206 the impact has been felt physically socially emotionally and psychologically
6621207 we are disgusted by claims of an affair between gregory hosa and kim snibson
6621208 the families are shocked by the lies that have been told about kathryn mckay and gregory hosa by the three offenders
6621209 to have the longest sentence for cruelty handed down at just four months i dont think is adequate
6621210 we have to send a very strong message to these perpetrators that these acts of violence and cruelty will not be tolerated in our community
6621211 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
6621212 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption

6621215 probably our best player for a long time so id like to see him get back to that

6621217 around 1000 people in our region are diagnosed with cancer each year and with 400 dying as a result it is important we do everything we can to help inverell residents who are struggling because of cancer
6621218 by simply purchasing fresh daffodils or other goodies on the day you can help give hope for a cancer free future as all dollars raised on daffodil day help fund vital cancer research prevention information and support services like the cancer council helpline 13 11 20
6621219 its important that the inverell community realise how even a small contribution or donation on daffodil day can help lessen the burden of cance
6621220 i have a blackberry pearl and the web browsing on it sucks like a tornado what i want is a web browsing device that rocks me like a hurricane id rather not have something large even as large as a netbook like the eee pc there are the nokia tablets theres the archos 605 705 wifi there are umpcs like the q1 ultra then theres the iphone ipod touch im looking for something that i can access the internet on from the couch or the john with a full html browser and i need something that wont break the bank
6621221 i understand that sen mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and
6621222 i was originally amazed that the first two pills i took of anatrim almost immediately took my cravings away now 4 weeks later 3 belt holes later i have become an advocate for this awesomely powerful natural supplement
6621223 this is the dumbest question you have ever asked would it be relevant to put my job on the line
6621224 it is not going to make it rain if i quit my job
6621225 we have to understand that queensland water is not that easy to get down to south australia
6621226 we are in a severe extreme drought situation and irrigators in sa are on 6 per cent allocation
6621227 we have a very difficult situation to manage here there is very little water in the dams and very limited water for all the competing needs across the basin
6621228 cut the best deal we can out of this impossible situation
6621229 oh it was a little bit of relief because youre waiting and youre anticipating
6621230 but i was ecstatic i really wanted the opportunity and i was looking forward to the opportunity to step into the head coaching job and i was just thrilled that he made the decision my way
6621231 robs passion coupled with the knowledge that he has gained from the past five years with providence makes him a good fit for us
6621232 we believe strongly in cultivating talent within the bruins family and rob is a good example of someone who deserved a promotion given his commitment to the organization
6621233 coming from being a player and then working with scott seeing the way that other guys coach one of his assets is his preparation his game preparation from day to day it was something that i really admired from him and i really aspire to continue that
6621234 thats one of the things i want to continue to do
6621235 i dont see changing those expectations that flash and i put on the team and i want to try to continue with as far as how his preparation was not even just for game day just preparing for the week of practice and knowing what we need to work on
6621236 not only the guys that played for us but the guys that were with us at the prospects camp theres a comfort zone that i have obviously with these guys
6621237 it was great that boston started this because it gives us a head start on our guys because were not waiting for the big camp for these guys to come in you get to know them a little bit you get to talk to the guys around the locker room

6621239 total outstanding uk consumer debt including credit cards loans and mortgages has increased by 7 3 per cent to 1 444 billion over the past year up from 1 346 billion in june 2007
6621240 will climb in the next six to 12 months as the fallout from the credit crisis shows its true colours
6621241 this new program is going to be a nice add on to the existing teenage leisure program we have running which is also one of a few that was funded by the state government
6621242 the need is there for the out of school hours care and we are pleased this was identified through the submission
6621243 these groups will be compatible by looking at interests their age and specific needs
6621244 indoor and outdoor activities as well as swimming and other sports will be available to them and we are looking forward to being able to offer this program
6621245 our staff are experience and qualified in disability studies child care and community services
6621246 they are very energetic and committed to providing a fun supportive environment
6621247 staff also have first aid qualifications and police screening prior to employment
6621248 it also means they can have respite and it will really help them out
6621249 these much needed places will provide stimulating and age appropriate developmental social and recreational activities for children with disability outside school hours
6621250 parents from right across australia have told the government there is an urgent need for more care places for older children
6621251 this program is a lot like our mens health pit stop program and is a fun and culturally sensitive way to screen for a range of health problems aboriginal people can face
6621252 we are not here today to glorify any battles we are here purely to remember our mates especially the four who did not come back corporal alex fotheringham lance corporal robert power private peter arnold and private peter mcgarry
6621253 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6621254 no matter what they do to try to tailor the game to brett they still cant recreate green bay
6621255 so were going to see brett favre play a little different style and im really excited about it
6621256 im hoping its more play action i hope hes holding the ball more dropping deeper i want to see him throw it down the field more because everyone says gunslinger great arm but green bay led the league in short passes
6621257 as a coach you try to decide where that line is and where do we go before we endanger brett favre
6621258 i cant remember when ive heard this kind of buzz in new york about football really ever
6621259 hes certainly given a shot in the arm to this city its been great it seems like its all we talk about on the radio
6621260 the first month is going to be really really difficult
6621261 when you go from one playbook to another its like learning a completely different language its not going to be easy im just trying to temper everyones enthusiasm he has a lot to learn and cant go out there and just fling it
6621262 the mental side is going to be tough but i think he can go out there and just fling it he is the best at just flinging it since you boomer
6621263 i think he is one of the five best throwers of the football ever in the history of the nfl he played in green bay all those years i think he can deal with the meadowlands
6621264 as far as adapting to terminology and plays if theres anybody in the league who can do it its him because of the experience hes had
6621265 i didnt get the job through nepotism i got it through my dad
6621266 o time do vasco sempre mostrou vontade e dedica o o problema eram as coisas que estavam vindo de fora o clima aqui sempre foi bom
6621267 o problema que s vezes nos exaltamos e tudo vira pol mica pela grandeza do vasco mas sab amos que o time n o ficaria passando por uma situa o ruim para sempre
6621268 n o podemos ter press o para trabalhar precisamos de calma e tranq ilidade para sair da zona de rebaixamento tenho certeza de que nosso grupo vai sair dessa situa o vamos come ar pelo jogo contra o palmeiras
6621269 nosso primeiro tempo foi muito bom criamos v rias oportunidades infelizmente n o transformarmos aquele bom momento em gol o gramado n o estava bom mas evito arrumar desculpa estava ruim para os dois times n o adiantar lamentar vamos ganhar pontos
6621270 seria um injusti a se n o sa ssemos daqui com uma vit ria jogamos melhor e ainda criamos mais oportunidades de gols nosso grupo sabia que a bola parada do gr mio seria uma arma que eles iriam utilizar mas n o conseguimos evitar o gol deles
6621271 a torcida est t o feliz quanto os jogadores nossa sorte est voltando assim como aconteceu ano passado e no come o deste brasileiro no gol tinha muita gente na minha frente e o obina ainda quase me atrapalhou mas eu consegui marcar
6621272 a torcida est de parab ns pois eles nos incentivaram e sa mos de campo com os tr s pontos a for a que eles tem me impressiona acredito que estou rendendo melhor que na rodada passada acredito que o entrosamento est melhorando
6621273 what i did not like was the judgmental tone in your post
6621274 nothing aamir does is a risk if he did a documentary on adivasis in the andamans he could possibly make q not having been part of that old discussion all i can say is that most of the regions good discussion this plus other articles
6621275 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
6621276 i carry your memory like a bag full of feathers
6621277 n o posso falar sobre a participa o deles mas ambos est o de parab ns o alex travou uma batalha com o wilson goiano e progrediu muito j o alan batalhou a todo o momento e foi muito importante
6621278 teremos de nos empenhar muito n o podemos nos comparar com o botafogo eles est o com uma base forte h dois anos e ainda contrataram jogadores como o gil e carlos alberto
6621279 what could i be doing instead that is more collaborative and more participative

6621323 open this book and youll meet the naked patron the greedy unenlightened patrons destination hell the masturbator horny old men mr three hats and a menagerie of other characters you never dreamt were housed at your public library
6621324 while you stop short of naming the individuals you targeted in your book your detailed descriptions of their unique characteristics and mannerisms make them easily identifiable in our small community
6621325 its always fun to come up with unique pairings cast reunions and surprising personalities as presenters on the emmy show and this year weve got a number of those

6621344 in terms of budget drona is my biggest film but i didnt deliberately model my character after mogambo in fact ive consciously tried to keep the drona villains character different from mogambo but the comparison is inevitable

6621371 itll be an intense love story shot in english there are only two characters father and son ill play the fathers role and for the sons role i will be sign a big star or a trained actor who is good at english
6621372 the rest of the cast will be from the country where it will be shot be it germany scotland or france
6621373 i have done everything this film is for my growth lets see how this international project works out
6621374 when i was in america i came to know that norah jones is pt ravi shankars daughter immediately the thought struck my mind that an american girl born of indian musician father wins grammy awards on her own will make a great story
6621375 i stayed there for two months to meet various people and gathered all the relevant information then i completed the script
6621376 it is not a biography on pt ravi shankar i met him there and explained that i am not making a biography on him otherwise i would have taken his permission
6621377 the thought or the idea inspired me and so i have written the script from it

6621380 there is a difference between a star and an actor anyone leading a flamboyant life can be a star for instance entrepreneur vijay mallya but he is not an actor
6621381 i have chosen to be an actor and dont believe in making my stepping out of the house an event i am a very simple person
6621382 there is no dream role that i want to play because i keep dreams and roles separate
6621383 either you work or you see dreams so i see dreams and choose roles separately a dream is called a dream because it can never be fulfilled in real life and i cherish them however when i pick up projects i go for only those that i can do justice to
6621384 opting for films that cater to a niche audience is not a deliberate effort i only go for a role when there is something in it that excites me its just like love and cant be articulated
6621385 but its not true that i am only doing serious roles i did comedy in honeymoon travels and would do the same in sankat city as well
6621386 there is nothing like unreal and real cinema actually there are only two types of movies believable and non believable a director can even successfully make a sci fi believable
6621387 although the sensibility of audience these days has definitely evolved more it is a result of the exposure of audiences to world cinema which wasnt there earlier
6621388 we have gone way beyond just isolated material elements and individual devices to complete fully integrated circuits in a manner that is applicable to systems with nearly arbitrary levels of complexity
6621389 the wavy concept now incorporates optimised mechanical designs and diverse sets of materials all integrated together in systems that involve spatially varying thicknesses and material types
6621390 the overall buckling process yields wavy shapes that vary from place to place on the integrated circuit in a complex but theoretically predictable fashion
6621391 the more robust the circuits are under bending the more easily they will adopt the wavy shapes which in turn allow overall system stretchability

6621394 im a pretty tough boot camp sergeant and i demand perfection in myself and expect it from the people around me especially keeping the kids focused honestly i dont expect anything from the kids that i dont do myself
6621395 what motivated me when i was that young living in paris out of an agency house was that it truly gave me an added advantage to get a jump start on what i truly wanted to achieve with my life in modeling
6621396 all i did was eat sleep and exercise modeling it was 24 7 modeling so executive producer stuart krasnow and i both wanted to incorporate that and to provide for the boys and girls proper nutrition proper health proper finance all things that your average model wont receive unless youre living in a house like this this is the first of its kind
6621397 i think if i had done this with any other talent the first conversation would have been okay how do we fake it how do a i sneak out of the house and sneak back in the morning janice lived there 24 7
6621398 she was in for the full run i really cant think of anybody else who really would do that along with the cast of a reality show i almost think it was harder for the kids to be in the house than it was for janice to be there
6621399 it means everything i eat and sleep for kids achieving their dreams
6621400 this allows me to give back in a field in an industry that i worship i just want to remain in the picture if i cant be in front of the camera im behind it i take photographs if im not taking the photographs im dining with the clients its all facets of the industry that i absolutely love
6621401 its a show that is so unique and different we are trying to bring diversity and equality into the agency with a vision that doesnt quite fit the magazine and the editorial mold thats out there as to date
6621402 i want it to be american and thats primarily what were doing were trying to keep it all american
6621403 the models do not know theyre being observed by me 24 7 so they cant get away with what they think they can get away with
6621404 i think with all of these reality shows theres a certain awareness that theyre on camera and they get very savvy about it they always try to stay a step ahead of us
6621405 you will see as the show progresses that not in a million years did they suspect that janice herself was having the same access as the producers have being able to go into the bedroom hit a button thats hidden inside of a mannequin and really be in the know and see everything the models were doing and really be able to watch it unedited and raw the same way we do we werent filtering anything for janice it really worked out well
6621406 you cant have hidden secrets because if it comes out on a job somewhere youre going to come up into some serious trouble
6621407 i discovered some of the models are having eating disorders others are having romantic trysts when it wasnt allowed inside the house you have to tune into the show to uncover what i saw on our surveillance cameras
6621408 they really really do trust what she has to say
6621409 since these models are up for real jobs and potentially real campaigns and real exposure its not an elimination show every piece of information they get from janice can be the difference between getting a job and not getting a job its real
6621410 it goes way beyond what we document on the show
6621411 her relationship with them is very real and very genuine and shes very much in their lives on every level
6621412 i think one of the things that being in the house really allowed us to show even more of this season than previous seasons is the full character that janice is
6621413 i think people mistakenly think that janice is this over the top caricature what anybody who knows janice knows that shes so multifaceted that as much as janice can have a side thats really tough and really extreme she also has a side thats really emotional she has so much heart i think that youre really going to see this very den mother side of janice that i dont think were used to seeing its actually very moving and very real
6621414 she may be gone in voice and body and her finger will no longer wag at us do it my way or youll be sorry
6621415 we didnt see anything wrong with the way we lived
6621416 we were pioneers the first real life family to be on tv and no one else will ever be as good
6621417 ryan is not only a spectacular broadcaster and producer but he is also the ideal ambassador for the e brand
6621418 it is a personal and professional thrill to be the beneficiary of ryans incredible work ethic flawless on air skills and fantastic instincts as a producer
6621419 comcast entertainment group is the perfect engine to help drive ryan seacrest productions to the next level in its evolution
6621420 my experience with e has been a perfect fit from the very start and i am thrilled to continue working with them on the air as well as developing and producing programming across all comcast networks
6621421 i used to not worry about him being out here but id always watch him now i dont want him talking to nobody
6621422 i looked out my kitchen window and saw three people and one was carrying a big stick
6621423 so i looked out towards b4 and there were a lot of people saying hes been stabbed hes in the bedroom bleeding
6621424 with the recent stabbings we tried to roll out as many people as possible
6621425 that is always going to be a concern when the community sees two stabbings in two days
6621426 other than firearms felony assaults in colorado springs are actually down over 14 percent
6621427 the unprecedented importation of old computers into africa from developed countries to satisfy information technology need has resulted in electronic waste that adds to environmental pollution
6621428 i appeal on developed countries not to use africa as a dumping site for computers
6621429 this is the situation in most african cities where computer villages for selling old imported computers especially laptops are springing up
6621430 a lot of used cars imported mostly from europe ply the streets of accra emitting high levels of smoke
6621431 we predicted that up to 30 of land birds may go extinct by 2100 due to a combination of climate change and habitat loss most worryingly 79 of bird species we predicted to go extinct are not currently considered threatened with extinction
6621432 this is to serve her husband bear nurse and nurture his children and be a housewife
6621433 do not give little importance to implementing the punishment required for any acts in opposition to the islam which your wife has committed whether it is in the home or outside it if you are forced to place punishment upon your wife after having adviced her and she didnt respond then let it be by staying away from her at bedtime
6621434 this shareeah is the straight and correct way anything other than this is the way of those who have earned the wrath of allaah such as the jews the christians and the polytheists
6621435 s ome muslims will deviate to the doctrines of the religion of the jews or that of the christians such deviation is made alluring by satan
6621436 islam is very sensitive about maintaining its purity and the unique identity of its followers to the voluntary recommended fast on the tenth of muharram muslims are required to add another day 9th or 11th to differentiate it from the then prevalent jewish practice muslims are forbidden to emulate the appearance of non muslims
6621437 allaah inflicted his punishment on all the people of the sabbath jews because of what they did they were changed into apes despised and rejected
6621438 since the era of the prophet until today the jews have been conspiring against the muslims and spreading dissension and despair among them so that they may not be able to defend their religion and restore their usurped lands for these reasons the muslims must come to their senses and stand united in the face of this jewish danger and its endless evil goals
6621439 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6621440 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6621441 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6621442 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6621443 barak obama is responsible for the content of maxmomfl gahayz please tell me that redneck high rise is real and not photo shop i dont know why but i
6621444 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
6621445 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
6621446 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
6621447 senator obama has not honored the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school
6621448 he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
6621449 car payments are a way of life and youll always have one
6621450 if im elected i promise ill make corporations pay their fair share
6621451 look at gm they brought in 193 billion but paid no taxes thieves
6621452 this is an example of when you add the potential costs of the potential solutions voters are going to back off from their support of ideals
6621453 i dont see any merit in a survey that lacks credibility the questions are so leading and misleading

6621457 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet
6621458 we are currently working towards having all of our company owned plantations officially rspo certified as quickly as possible in 2008
6621459 theres currently no palm oil in the world that can be proven to be sustainable
6621460 its really important for the market to step up and create demand
6621461 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6621462 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6621463 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6621464 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6621465 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6621466 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6621467 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6621468 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6621469 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6621470 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
6621471 sports illustrated evolution of the game tour presented by nissan
6621472 coming in i planned on fighting for playing time even if it was just one play
6621473 coming into the meetings today when they announced scout team i was kind of on the border like what are they going to do with me then i found out i wasnt running scout and i was a little bit excited i have a chance to be a solid back up and i was pretty happy
6621474 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6621475 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6621476 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6621477 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6621478 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz
6621479 like our entire country we the five brothers unjustly imprisoned contemplate you with pride
6621480 i am the point where i know when i mess up right when it happens as opposed to not knowing anything about it until the coaches tell me afterwards
6621481 mom when will my days here be over i am tired of this life
6621482 i am just tired of being in this life and ready to grow up so i can be a clown
6621483 i dont know baby but i hope it is a long time from now like when you are a great grandmother like nana or grandmama dobbs
6621484 it was apparently a great talk when i asked her if she had any questions she meowed and told me she was no longer k she is now a cat
6621485 its self study so people can do it in the evening weekends after work they dont need to quit their jobs or go back and take additional college courses
6621486 its unfortunate that the ombudsman has accepted ignorance as an excuse on this occasion we would have liked to see a prosecution nevertheless this should serve as a warning to all dodgy bosses in retail
6621487 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3 there were titles like wario land shake it which we think will be really fun titles that we have showcased
6621488 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage
6621489 we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
6621490 i had bought the pickup like this and the tint cant be removed
6621491 yeah well im the one who is going to give you the ticket not the sherriff or who ever
6621492 im pretty sure theyre probably thinking about that and dont want that to happen again but its preseason its time to get work this is a time where we really perfect our craft and this is a time to test yourself especially for myself this being my first preseason game
6621493 its a learning experience theyre going to have some tough games but theyre excellent athletes and theyre great competitors and theyre learning every day on the job
6621494 champs in good shape champs had a good week theres been no setback and hes practiced every day so im sure hes looking forward to playing his first game
6621495 were not putting extra pressure on ourselves but we definitely want to get some momentum going into the season
6621496 we realize the last game a lot of times is just polish for one or two series maybe stay healthy get out of the game and let the younger guys play
6621497 booger red kelly 41 an auto body worker was found guilty overnight of engaging in organised criminal activity
6621498 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children mr davidson said
6621499 booger red kelly 41 an auto body worker was found guilty overnight of engaging in organised criminal activity
6621500 there goes berylla getting close to the edge of the parking lot get her before she gets in the street posco she ran to the other side of the house and i cant see her please get her and so it went on
6621501 please go get berylla before she wanders into the street
6621502 do you realize she just almost went into the street
6621503 i didnt realize she got that close to the street yet but that is why i sent my son to get her and bring her back here
6621504 well do you have any idea what child endangerment is letting children run around by themselves is not safe
6621505 i stop short not wanting to draw attention to my pregnancy and the hwole irresponsible with too many kids thing so i asked him i thought he would get her in time
6621506 why didnt you get her out of the street in time
6621507 that was the lady that almost hit your child but stopped and saved your childs life you should be grateful you need to lose your attitude now
6621508 im not getting an attitude but i want to know who they are and whats going on here
6621509 well it sounds like you have an attitude to me and i dont like it
6621510 as always we remind students and parents of the limitations of these and other rankings which they should use as only one source of information as they engage with the college application process
6621511 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6621512 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6621513 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6621514 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6621515 its just the cost of everything has gone up you try to do it as budget conscious as possible
6621516 as far as the cost of the airlines i was pricing tickets and they were going to be 250 300 a person and you cant afford to take everybody
6621517 but we cant meet the demand with the current fleet
6621518 a self reliant attitude among girls and young women manifested in ambition assertiveness and individualism
6621519 i had something wrong with my groin and quad possibly a tear
6621520 they didnt run any tests but it really bothered me anytime i tried to kick so i just took some time off i felt better a little sore but better im just trying to take it easy not swinging 100 percent or anything like that trying to build that muscle back up
6621521 whos going to be our kicker punter im really not sure
6621522 whos going to start at a number of positions im really not sure defensive tackle cory grissom took a small step toward returning from a sprained ankle as he was no longer wearing a boot on his injured
6621523 oh yes i do have something for him to do
6621524 it was very frightening all i had done was photograph these police officers doing something illegal but i was the one who ended up being arrested
6621525 four out of five clients i see regret their decision to have anti aging surgical procedures
6621526 no matter how much money you spend or how much plastic surgery you have or how many dermatologist visits you schedule inevitably times winged chariot will catch up to you and march all over your face
6621527 how much traffic and profits would i like to see this week
6621528 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6621529 the risk of disease associated with public drinking water has passed from the theoretical to the real
6621530 clearly this is a problem our cars are becoming just another place to catch up on calls and now e mail and thats a real safety problem
6621531 jon fly by the instruments thats what theyre for dont trust your perceptions trust what the instruments tell you
6621532 jon the rock of truth under your feet will not long feel like sand
6621533 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square kilometers
6621534 in at least the last 4 000 to 6 000 years
6621535 lying isnt a criminal offense lying doesnt mean that youre a murderer
6621536 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6621537 we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings
6621538 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6621539 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6621540 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6621541 i think hes just using that as an excuse to help promote his game being it comes out so close to the remembrance of the attack
6621542 its just gonna be insane when it comes because then we will find what it is
6621543 and then we get to name the baby its gonna be such chaos amazing chaos
6621544 we used best available data based on trends to that date with a 20 year window and everything was moving pretty predictably at that time
6621545 for many many families there is no money at the end of the month to buy taxable items so our revenue is down
6621546 we just want to make sure the public understands where we are how we got there explain some options and get an idea of where they want us to go
6621547 prices are going up all the time and this is a service we need that the city needs its important for energy conservation and the planet
6621548 i just came by and noticed a lot of commotion
6621549 now im just worried about my colleagues and my friends from an outside perspective these are just campaign workers but from my perspective these are my friends and im just hoping and praying theyre alright and that theyre safe
6621550 we want to engage the new media we want to provide access to them unlike anything they have ever seen at any other convention before
6621551 im bored dont we need to do something run errands
6621552 the doctors really believe that maureen is going to bounce back pretty fast from this
6621553 but it is very serious and sensitive surgery because of the way the tumor is wrapped around the auditory nerve its certainly no walk in the park
6621554 for him to take two weeks off to take care of this issue its not a surprise at all
6621555 but i got to tell you from a political perspective its a very costly decision
6621556 will continue even though bob will be away and we expect that our opponents campaign will do the same
6621557 bob is selling himself and so he has to be out there letting people get to know him
6621558 not being able to do that hurts his campaign what it shows is that bob cares more about his family than he does his campaign and thats a beautiful thing his priorities are in the right place and thats the kind of guy i want in office
6621559 our family appreciates the support and prayers of our many friends across colorado and we both look forward to returning to the campaign trail in september
6621560 our hearts went out to mike when he suffered the injury against
6621561 mike is an impressive young man with a bright future and we
6621562 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment
6621563 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films
6621564 i dont want your chicken strips and fries i want it to be like the kind mrs treiber makes
6621565 i thought you said we were having french fries with dinner i want fries like mcdonalds mom

6621567 they are cheap now an umbrella used to be something you might keep for a lifetime now an umbrella is for one storm
6621568 it has some zooplankton but overwhelmingly what were seeing here are plastic particles
6621569 the ocean has become a plastic soup this is the soup
6621570 this is the new beach sand that weve seeing throughout the pacific islands
6621571 formerly we got sand by breaking down rock and coral now were getting sand by breaking down plastic
6621572 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6621573 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6621574 our job is to fight hard but on the mat yet we are all very nervous here wondering what will become of our country which made it difficult to concentrate
6621575 data from the uk met office shows that temperatures in the first half of the year have been more than 0 1 celsius cooler than any year since 2000
6621576 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6621577 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6621578 i don know how mahan did it the 48 year old perry said
6621579 i think its interesting that everyone talked about how we win all the time and no one could compete
6621580 it was proven today that teams can the sport should remain its global its international its been a beautiful last two weeks of softball
6621581 honestly i havent even thought about the big picture the loss just hurts too much right now to think about the future
6621582 id take away two pitches the double and the home run those were the only two balls they really hit solid and they just happened to do that at the right time but i felt good
6621583 the first rbi wasnt a hard hit ball it just went to the right spot where we couldnt make a play
6621584 were devastated at the decision at the same time we know that there is still hope we went through our mourning period and anger and frustration with the decision but weve moved forward its over for now but its not for good

6621586 i think ill have my staff get back to you
6621587 i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it might not be surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong
6621588 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6621589 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6621590 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6621591 this kind of a rain event has just never happened before
6621592 it seems to me we got more rain in this one event that we did cumulative for all the storms of 2004 and 2005
6621593 i dont think we expected it to be as bad as it was
6621594 fay is forecast to move slowly across the northern florida peninsula tonight and early friday and be very near the gulf coast of the florida panhandle by late friday or early saturday
6621595 brevard long term recovery coalition is definitely activating to respond for the long term recovery effort
6621596 we are working with find florida interfaith networking in disaster baptist disaster relief and umcor united methodist committee on relief to try to coordinate an effort for this
6621597 as we get numbers from fema with their assessment then well get our faith based community friends to partner with us to do a more through case management type assessment
6621598 they had roof issues and soffit issues now with all the rain and everything now we may have totaled homes instead of just repairs
6621599 its kind of a double whammy for poor palm bay
6621600 my phone has been ringing non stop for two days
6621601 every long term recovery organization in the state has called offering assistance its really been an overwhelming response and im so grateful for all the assistance that everyone has offered
6621602 the handover of the suspects took place in line with cooperation between the two brotherly countriesw and under the security cooperation agreement
6621603 we have started examining these cases and will handle them according to the same criteria as other asylum requests received from abroad
6621604 switzerland should accept this small contingent of three people to show the international community that the time has come to find a humanitarian solution we have to help close down guantanmo
6621605 they are at major risk of persecution if they are sent bak to their homelands
6621606 every possible effort is being made to protect dr aafias rights as an under trial prisoner
6621607 even the chief priests had parameters matthew 27 6 but the chief priests taking the pieces of youth ministry 3
6621608 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
6621609 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today
6621610 the feeling that the other people in the room actually play video games and enjoy them as much as you do
6621611 its like the fascination that young people have here with football
6621612 two years back when i would talk to people about cricket people hardly knew anything about it
6621613 today we actually have people who come and watch our matches
6621614 at first it seems a little complex because its like a one inning baseball game where everyone gets to bat
6621615 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
6621616 i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas
6621617 theres not a parent on planet earth who wouldnt want a daughter like this
6621618 maybe i have more opportunities as a designer over there but im making a bigger statement over here
6621619 in the same way that ralph lauren stands for america chanel for france and versace for italy i want aschobi to stand for african fashion
6621620 i know this is the last place youd expect to find haute couture but i want to replace all of this darkness of the past with beauty
6621621 everybody thinks i should be in paris london or new york
6621622 ive given up a lot to be here and i miss paris and the fashion life in america but this is really important to me
6621623 this is my only job this is my life actually
6621624 we have a lot who are returning who are very successful with the experience and skills the country needs but of course the salary is not there
6621625 a lot of them are even leaving family behind but theyre making these sacrifices to come back and help the development of the country
6621626 i do not like to talk about politics all that i like to do is business business and business all over the world we talk about gender equality and one way to promote this is to help women entrepreneurs
6621627 many people here have this resistance factor to returnees because they feel that unlike those in the diaspora they themselves stayed here throughout the war and suffered and now they should get all the jobs
6621628 they see it in your face you look fresh and wholesome and they hear it in my accent i probably have to be living here five years before people accept me
6621629 its like all of it was inside waiting to burst out for so long i am african and that in itself is a statement its the idea you carry yourself in your clothes you wear the pride of the textile
6621630 i think what i am doing is in line with anyone coming here to open a school or a hospital i know it is enriching this country
6621631 im probably going to be losing more money than im making for now but i want to start selling wholesale the market in sierra leone is very small people who have money tend to spend it abroad
6621632 but profit will come i know im going to be a very wealthy lady one day
6621633 the national assembly calls upon the federal government to take up the matter with the united states authorities to urgently provide necessary medical assistance including hospitalisation to her make provision of female doctor for her medical examination as well as treatment give full respect to her religious beliefs and provide regular consular access as well as for regular family visits to dr aafia
6621634 the government is concerned about her detention and the violation of human rights we are in touch with the family and trying to engage a competent attorney
6621635 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
6621636 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
6621637 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6621638 a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6621639 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
6621640 we thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed
6621641 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
6621642 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
6621643 we dont censor our products the game just wasnt selling
6621644 i dont know if its in our immediate future its something we talk about every few months well know when the time is right if were going to do it
6621645 its something we would never take lightly and just saying that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6621646 we want a big farm and to just take care of every kind of animal that needs taking care of
6621647 we were watching the fish and she said this is a pretty romantic moment right
6621648 getting married is not something weve ever taken for granted
6621649 that we get to do this it means a lot
6621650 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6621651 somebody sent me an email one morning saying i was dating kathy griffin and i said who is she
6621652 these press guys they get seated first at the macworld shows they get seated first in the prime seats they arent cutting in line
6621653 i was teaching seven days a week for eight years i didnt want the press around the children
6621654 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6621655 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6621656 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6621657 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6621658 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6621659 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6621660 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6621661 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6621662 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6621663 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too janjua said but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6621664 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6621665 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6621666 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6621667 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6621668 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6621669 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6621670 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6621671 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6621672 het was gewoon onwerkelijk net zo onwerkelijk als het moment waarop ik zeven jaar geleden hoorde dat ik leukemie had
6621673 maar zo koeltjes als ik destijds die woorden tot me nam zo afstandelijk tikte ik hier als eerste aan
6621674 er werd aanvankelijk nogal terughoudend gereageerd het kon niet gezegd worden kreeg ik te horen maar dat accepteerde ik niet ik ben realist ik moest het weten toen bleek het 30 tot 50 procent te zijn daarop ben ik het ziekenhuis ingegaan en heb ik een half jaar lang alle behandelingen ondergaan
6621675 dat ik hier zit dank ik voor een groot deel aan de donateurs van het kankerfonds zij hebben het met hun bijdrage mede mogelijk gemaakt dat ik ben genezen en hier kon winnen
6621676 de leukemie heeft me geleerd stap voor stap te denken wanneer je in een ziekenhuisbed ligt en zo verschrikkelijk veel pijn hebt kun je niet denken aan de volgende week zelfs niet aan de volgende dag je denkt hooguit aan het volgende uur je moet geduld hebben afwachten diezelfde strategie heb ik vandaag in deze race gehanteerd rustig blijven en je kans afwachten
6621677 het zou mooi zijn voor het verhaal maar eerlijk gezegd had ik het daarvoor gewoon te druk met mijn tactiek
6621678 het is heel kwalijk dat hij op deze manier andere pati nten probeert te inspireren ik hoop niet dat hij mensen op de gedachte brengt dat ze wel even kunnen wachten met behandelen als ze iets belangrijkers te doen hebben
6621679 maar zijn verhaal is mij iets te amerikaans hij lag in het ziekenhuis vocht tegen de kanker en iedere keer als hij moest overgeven gooide hij de zieke vijand er uit hij streed en overwon ik heb die periode heel anders beleefd eigenlijk heb ik alles lijdzaam ondergaan ik wil hier niet de indruk wekken dat ik zelf de ziekte heb overwonnen dat is niet zo
6621680 de mensen om me heen de dokters en medici hebben me genezen ik heb nooit hoeven vechten tegen kanker vandaag heb ik pas gevochten voor deze gouden medaille
6621681 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6621682 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6621683 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6621684 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6621685 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6621686 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6621687 the memory of that period has to be kept alive
6621688 had it had not been for the berlin kindertransporte i would never have survived the war
6621689 we havent found any breach of our policies so far with respect to student safety and security were going to continue to look into the matter but we found no breach in our policies at this point
6621690 there have been reports of inappropriate contacts between recruiters and minors but really the more pressing issue for parents that have contacted us is that they just simply cant get the recruiter to leave their child alone
6621691 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6621692 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6621693 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6621694 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6621695 nbc s decision to delay broadcasting the opening ceremonies by 12 hours sent people across the country to their computers to poke holes in nbc s technological wall
6621696 we may have started on different paths but today our paths have merged
6621697 whatever insincere words of support the clintons muster their primal scream gets louder he cant win he cant close the deal we told you so
6621698 it was a very close contest she has many supporters at the convention and in the country a number of whom have taken the loss very hard
6621699 hillary will try to show the democrats they chose the wrong savior
6621700 i dont remember ever as a delegate feeling bad about being at a convention and supporting my candidate
6621701 to be pulling people together and not mashing them into the ground
6621702 the memory of that period has to be kept alive we owe that to all the victims
6621703 had it had not been for the berlin kindertransporte i would never have survived the war
6621704 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6621705 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6621706 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6621707 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6621708 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6621709 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6621710 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6621711 this is an example of when you add the potential costs of the potential solutions voters are going to back off from their support of ideals

6621813 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
6621814 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
6621815 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
6621816 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
6621817 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
6621818 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
6621819 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
6621820 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
6621821 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
6621822 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
6621823 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
6621824 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
6621825 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
6621826 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
6621827 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
6621828 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
6621829 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
6621830 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
6621831 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
6621832 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
6621833 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
6621834 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
6621835 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
6621836 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
6621837 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6621838 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6621839 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6621840 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6621841 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6621842 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6621843 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6621844 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6621845 the british government may have been accused of being bushs poodle but the british courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights
6621846 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6621847 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6621848 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6621849 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6621850 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6621851 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6621852 the internet king i wonder if he could provide faster nudity

6621856 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6621857 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6621858 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
6621859 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet
6621860 we are currently working towards having all of our company owned plantations officially rspo certified as quickly as possible in 2008
6621861 theres currently no palm oil in the world that can be proven to be sustainable
6621862 its really important for the market to step up and create demand
6621863 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square kilometers
6621864 in at least the last 4 000 to 6 000 years
6621865 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6621866 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6621867 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6621868 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6621869 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6621870 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6621871 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6621872 its not really a huge sacrifice on their part to do it
6621873 i might as well sell an offset for when i turn my bedroom light off at night
6621874 as a long term strategy it could be quite detrimental
6621875 they are somewhat esoteric markets as they are when people see things that seemingly dont have any additionality it increases skepticism
6621876 one of the reasons weve steered clear of sequestration and soil sequestration projects is precisely that some of these have questions around additionality so we dont do any of that project type
6621877 if you make the stipulations too onerous and too expensive then you might not get anyone to come and play in your market
6621878 have to think hard and fast about the trade offs in sacrificing quality in the name of trading volumes
6621879 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6621880 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6621881 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6621882 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6621883 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6621884 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
6621885 we predicted that up to 30 of land birds may go extinct by 2100 due to a combination of climate change and habitat loss most worryingly 79 of bird species we predicted to go extinct are not currently considered threatened with extinction

6621898 walking or cycling to school doesnt take as long as people think
6621899 however theres an awful lot more we have to do to make roads safer understandably parents have real concerns about traffic both the volume and the speed of traffic need to be reduced and were pressing the government to implement 20mph schemes in residential areas
6621900 we have to do something dramatic to address obesity climate change and the lack of freedom that children are suffering from children are becoming cotton wool kids and unless they have freedom they wont have the levels of fitness they need

6621904 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past 10 years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability the decision to move harry potter and the half blood prince was not taken lightly and was never intended to upset our harry potter fans we know you have built this series into what it is and we thank you for your ongoing enthusiasm and support if i may offer a silver lining there would have been a two year gap between half blood prince and the much anticipated first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows which opens in november 2010

6621962 we heard some brilliant misquotes during our research that had us in stitches
6621963 however theres a serious side to the survey as it highlights the sad fact that in the uk alone there is an estimate nine million people classed as deaf or hard of hearing and four million of those are not receiving any form of treatment at all
6621964 its alright its okay you make love the other way

6621977 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6621978 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6622011 its not everybody its just stupid is everywhere we just met stupid for awhile
6622012 this is seeding capital for firefighters to run grassroots campaigns in local electorates
6622013 were not proposing to run television advertisements were not proposing to run mainstream radio advertisements or take full page ads out
6622014 the message weve got for employers throughout the territory is to make sure that they really do understand the law and understand the wages that must be paid at all times
6622015 courts now take these offences very seriously they might order a penalty of somewhere between the same amount of the underpayment or even two or three times the size of the underpayment

6622024 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed

6622026 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6622027 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6622028 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat

6622062 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie

6622068 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6622069 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6622070 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low

6622074 ausdrill is in its best ever financial and operational shape and is positioned to continue its strong performance for the foreseeable future he said
6622075 all of our core divisions made positive contributions to the record profit with strong performances in both australia and africa
6622076 ausdrill is well placed to capitalise on the unprecedented demand for mining industry services globally
6622077 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this he told abc radio
6622078 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6622079 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6622080 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago he said
6622081 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later he said
6622082 the scene was set for bhp and rio yesterday afternoon and the market anticipated their stocks would benefit
6622083 in urlscan 3 0 we added the ability to do filtering based on the query string in addition to the url
6622084 we also added the ability to create more granular rules that can be targeted to specific types of requests for example you can write a rule that only applies to asp pages or php pages which is something you would never be able to do in urlscan 2 5
6622085 really the application running on the server is the only piece of code that actually knows what the sql query is intended to do
6622086 so the fix for the root cause is for application developers to go in and do the validation and make sure that the sql data that they are sending to the sql server is what they intend
6622087 just set up a quick travel page send it to your friends and the mob mentality takes over people love throwing out suggestions of where to go and what to do its a giant brainstorm a collaborative travel fantasy that actually comes to fruition with the click of a button

6622093 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6622094 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6622095 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks

6622110 if anyone feels any flu like symptoms or gastrointestinal difficulties and has eaten a recalled product in the last two or three weeks should see a physician
6622111 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6622112 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year
6622113 if the default pricing formula was kept beyond next season it would create a real risk of processors making investment decisions that are economically unsustainable
6622114 introduction of an auction from the 2010 11 season will remove uncertainty for fonterra independent producers and for farmers
6622115 a mixed public and private practice can be a positive if it contributes to improved access to health care
6622116 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6622117 theres no doubt that those kinds of proposals would increase access for people who can afford to pay for their own health care but they would decrease access and wait times for everybody else
6622118 thats been the experience in australia where they implemented a private system alongside the public system in those areas where the amount of private activity was greatest the wait times were the highest in the public system
6622119 first the b c residents have the same strain as the outbreak strain that has been identified in ontario and second they have been exposed to the foods that are under recall
6622120 they are adults not elderly but they both have underlying conditions that put them at higher risk
6622121 this is a very high profile recall with a high profile company
6622122 the average consumer can check in their fridges for the recalled meat which they can return to stores or just discard
6622123 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6622124 there hasnt been any confirmation and the testing is ongoing its quite difficult because listeria has an incubation period between two and 30 days and it has been up to 90 days
6622125 were all jumping in and trying to get to the bottom of it the investigation is very complex and involved and it takes lot of old fashioned detective work

6622128 heres a question what kind of man pays thirty five bucks to get into a concert then gets thrown out during the first band
6622129 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6622130 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6622131 thats all ive got in there thats my apartment thats all my stuff so i dont know whats going to happen i wasnt expecting to come home to a bus in my apartment
6622132 thats the craziest thing ive ever seen in my life
6622133 all of a sudden i see the bus driver running after the bus i thought that he was trying to pull it over or something i saw it jump on the curb riding it down the side of the curb and then it jumps to the right
6622134 i was told he physically tried to stop the bus but he was outside of the bus and he realized that was a losing battle
6622135 couldnt believe it couldnt believe that a bus was actually in our building
6622136 steven is one of the premier nfl players and eventually could be considered one of the best to ever play the running back position
6622137 steven is young and coming into his prime we look forward to his enjoying a long and productive career with the rams
6622138 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6622139 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6622140 i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of gene upshaw
6622141 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as the executive director of the nflpa
6622142 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6622143 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6622144 he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6622145 genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come all of us in the nfl reach out with our sympathy to terri and the upshaw family
6622146 it really disturbs me right now with all the people on silver spring leaving
6622147 if we play our cards right we can easily piggyback off of bayshore

6622151 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6622152 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6622153 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6622154 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6622155 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
6622156 i carry your memory like a bag full of feathers
6622157 my six year old nephew was saved but we dont know what happened to his sister
6622158 roberto is in hospital they say he is injured but not seriously he has been sedated and is unconscious he is alive at least we dont know anything of his sister
6622159 i grabbed the arm of my partner jos and looked at gema my sister in law then the plane came to a sharp stop i heard a horrible noise i was thrown forward
6622160 i reached for jos put out my hand to touch him i saw what looked like a doll which fell on the ground i realised this person was dead i knew it wasnt jos
6622161 there are other ways to get from side to side than going on george st
6622162 we dont need another bridge closer to this one i wouldnt support paying for that
6622163 a lot of people were talking about the repairs and getting over the bridge last night in the bar and we were getting calls wondering if we were open
6622164 really i dont find we need another bridge around here we already have the overpass and the area near abercrombie so youre really talking about adding a fourth bridge not a second one
6622165 aside from times like this when work is being done traffic isnt too heavy on george street
6622166 i walked the bridge in my uniform and i didnt get the finger or get honked at once
6622167 were really so appreciative of the publics co operation here and also the local businesses
6622168 well be keeping a close eye on him from now on

6622175 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document fig president bruno grandi said earlier this week in an interview with the associated press

6622177 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6622178 a misguided initiative that uses deliberately misleading information to confuse the public
6622179 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6622180 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6622181 we were in the hot tub come on in ill m m meet you
6622182 i saw her in one this past summer when she and jill hung out my parents pool she looked like a greek goddess
6622183 yes but i think with one more drink or two alex is going to jump you
6622184 cant blame him not with you two dressed like that
6622185 tina keeps rubbing up against alex im sure hes already sporting a lump in his pants she definitely has plans for him
6622186 i think i am just as long as she comes home with me
6622187 sounds like college is going to be one hell of a romp for you two
6622188 those two women are all but throwing themselves at alex and hes eating it up
6622189 but thats exactly what carrie and tina plan on doing both would like to try a black man and alex is the lucky guy
6622190 well we were sort of hoping that youd be willing to have some fun too
6622191 but it looks like alex and the ladies are going to do something in either case
6622192 they would hell it looks like theyre all ready to rip each others clothes off any second
6622193 tell them i said goodbye if they even notice im gone
6622194 if its what they want then so be it i wont stop them
6622195 its been fun but i already knew that we wouldnt be together for long hes not really my type
6622196 its too cold out there besides its not like you live around here
6622197 why not come back inside and well figure it out there
6622198 i think the alcohol is beginning to hit me i could probably use to lie down for a while
6622199 you can use carries room i promise to make sure no one bothers you
6622200 im still trying to figure out a way of getting you out of that wrap youre wearing
6622201 its an least an inch longer than joels and robbies
6622202 in my family we always had wine with dinner just a half glass when we were kids
6622203 ive been wondering how it would feel to kiss you since the first moment i laid eyes on you
6622204 youre just hoping that a kiss will lead to something more
6622205 it feels like its christmas and im getting to unwrap one last present the big one my father always saved for last
6622206 i hope santa brings me the same thing next christmas youre the best present i ever received
6622207 i thought alexs big dick would have taken care of that
6622208 only i dont give it to every guy alex has been trying for weeks but i wouldnt let him have it
6622209 thankfully being as youre carries man youre not one of mine so you wont have to work so hard in fact youre welcome to it
6622210 come on white boy fill my black ass with your cum
6622211 you arent my first white man but youre certainly the best
6622212 i figured you two would be here tina is riding alexs face while carrie is taking his pole in her ass i thought now would be a good time to find you guys

6622224 introduction of an auction from the 2010 11 season will remove uncertainty for fonterra independent producers and for farmers

6622226 judge kitty brennan is an outstanding judge and a well respected member of the legal community
6622227 her experience on the bench will serve her well in this new role
6622228 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6622229 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

6622232 this will lead to conservatives going on to new university bashing rather than them taking it to heart
6622233 sometimes we need to be as smart with who delivers the message as we are with the message itself

6622235 the way i feel is im eager to work on building positive working relationships
6622236 i hope this is an opportunity for renewal and a fresh start
6622237 theyre somewhat uncharacteristic for an outgoing university of wisconsin chancellor
6622238 however you slice it theyre had no real increases in funding from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2007 and in real terms its been a decline
6622239 its john wiley stealing the thunder of biddy martin who should have this honeymoon period she tries to lay out her agenda
6622240 what this unfortunately does is it changes the dynamics of what people are going to be talking about
6622241 wmcs had their blinders on that the only way to improve the economy is to hand out tax cuts to businesses which means you have to cut funding elsewhere
6622242 i have great respect for john wiley and the job he did at the university and i agree that extreme ideologies are not the way to move wisconsin forward

6622245 we not only maintained our position as the biggest bank in the world but also became the most profitable bank in the world jiang jianqing chairman of the bank told reporters
6622246 almost all business loans in icbc have been growing very quickly mr jiang said
6622247 we have been growing our credit but at the same time we have also been growing our net fee and commission based income businesses
6622248 icbc began to sell down those bonds since early this year mr jiang said
6622249 from early this year until now we have sold us8 billion worth of fannie and freddie bonds as well as alt a bonds
6622250 the profit growth will slow down with narrower interest margin while the credit costs will go up as there is a big chance of economic slowdown in mainland china in the second half and a credit problem is likely to emerge he said
6622251 we still have the second half to go so we will continue to work hard mr jiang told reporters in response to a question on icbc overtaking hsbc as the most profitable bank a corker too dear to drink
6622252 the australian market for transport fuels and convenience retailing will continue to grow and caltex is well positioned to capture future market opportunities managing director des king said
6622253 refiner margins are expected to be volatile but remain robust overall
6622254 continued strength in diesel and jet fuel margins will likely compensate for the expected weakening in petrol demand mr king said
6622255 caltex recognised early in 2008 the possible negative impact of rising crude oil prices and reduced petrol demand caused by the us economic slowdown and took measures to respond to these challenges mr king said
6622256 sales of regular petrol eased in line with the overall market but caltex outstripped the market in growth of diesel jet fuel and higher margin premium petrol sales mr king said
6622257 lubricants sales volumes and margins increased as did margins for specialties mr king said
6622258 exceptionally strong for diesel and jet fuel due to high demand in asia which had helped offset weaker margins for petrol driven by the us economic slowdown
6622259 caltex remains committed to a conservative balance sheet and will continue its focus on good cash management mr king said a corker too dear to drink

6622284 we have not found anything hazardous in the initial testing in the initial examination we did
6622285 we have no reports of anybody being sick we have 12 people quarantined here on scene who were exposed three of those law enforcement two firefighters and seven civilians none of them are showing any symptoms nobodys reporting any sickness
6622286 in any situation like this when its a little out of the norm unusual something that could create a hazard we really want to jump on it right away and make sure were protecting the folks coming into see us but the patients and health care workers that we currently have in the hospital
6622287 our haz mat team did not said that they did not see any powder the letter certainly had some threatening language so they had reason to fear but we did not find the initial report was white powder they did not find any large quantities it was described to me as they found maybe a couple granules of something it tested positive for protein
6622288 any time you send a threatening letter and there was threatening language in the letter thats a crime so law enforcement wants to take this very seriously

6622410 si la resurrecci n de los muertos no se da tampoco cristo resucit y si cristo no resucit vana es nuestra predicaci n y vana nuestra fe seremos falsos testigos de dios porque contra dios testificamos que ha resucitado a cristo a quien no resucit si es que los muertos no resucitan pero no cristo primicia de los que durmieron ha resucitado de entre los muertos y como en ad n todos mueren as tambi n en cristo todos revivir n

6622415 pero dir alguno c mo resucitar n los muertos con qu cuerpo vuelven a la vida necio lo que t siembras no nace si no muere y lo que siembras no es el cuerpo que ha de nacer sino un simple grano por ejemplo de trigo o alg n otro similar y dios le da el cuerpo seg n ha querido a cada una de las semillas del propio cuerpo
6622416 no todos moriremos pero todos seremos transformados en un instante en un abrir y cerrar de ojos al ltimo toque de la trompeta pues tocar la trompeta y los muertos resucitar n incorruptos y nosotros seremos transformados no en la materia porque es preciso que lo corruptible se revista de incorrupci n y que este ser mortal se revista de inmortalidad
6622417 hermanos no queremos que est is en la ignorancia respecto a los muertos nosotros los que vivamos los que quedemos hasta la venida del se or no nos adelantaremos a los que murieron el se or mismo a la orden dada por la voz de un arc ngel y por la trompeta de dios bajara del cielo y los que murieron en cristo resucitar n en primer lugar despu s nosotros los que vivamos los que quedemos seremos arrebatados en nubes junto con ellos al encuentro del se or en los aires y as estaremos siempre con el se or

6622424 aunque yo s escribe san juan cris stomo que mucha gente tiene horror a la gehenna a m me parece que solamente la privaci n de la gloria del reino de dios es una tortura m s cruel que aquella
6622425 esta privaci n de los bienes razona en otro lugar nos causa tanto sufrimiento tanta aflicci n y estrechez que si no existiera ning n castigo para los que pecan viviendo aqu turbar a y desgarrar a nuestras almas m s que todos los suplicios de la gehenna muchas personas insensatas desean s lo librarse de la gehenna pero yo creo que mayor suplicio aun en comparaci n con sta ser a la inexistencia para nosotros de aquella gloria y estoy seguro que el que la ha perdido debe llorar no tanto por las torturas de la gehenna como por la imposibilidad de disfrutar de los bienes celestiales porque este ltimo es el m s cruel de todos los castigos
6622426 quiere que se salven todos los hombres y lleguen a la comprensi n de la verdad

6622429 dios es bueno desapasionado e inmutable si alguien reconociendo como verdadero y bueno el hecho de que dios es inmutable se sorprende porque dios teniendo estas cualidades se regocija por los buenos pero aborrece a los malvados y se encoleriza con ellos y otra vez tiene misericordia de ellos cuando se arrepienten habr que contestar que en realidad dios ni se alegra ni se encoleriza porque la alegr a y la ira son pasiones humanas ser a rid culo creer que sobre la divinidad pueden influir bien o mal los negocios humanos dios es bueno y solamente hace bien y no da a a nadie siendo siempre inmutable mientras tanto nosotros cuando somos buenos entramos en comuni n con dios gracias a la semejanza con l pero cuando obramos mal nos apartamos de l debido a que perdemos aquel parecido de modo que decir que dios aborrece a los malos ser a lo mismo que afirmar que el sol se esconde de los ciegos
6622430 el que rein antes de vencer a sus enemigos acaso no reinar con m s raz n despu s de vencerlos

6622435 dar a cada uno seg n sus obras cada uno recibir su recompensa conforme a su trabajo y una estrella se diferencia de la otra en el resplandor
6622436 as como por medio de los sensibles rayos del sol cada uno goza de acuerdo con la pureza de su vista e impresi n que tenga o como cada rayo de luz procedente de una l mpara que ilumina la casa tiene su propio lugar mientras que la luz no se divide entre muchas l mparas asimismo todos los rectos se ubicar n inseparablemente en la alegr a com n pero cada uno conforme con su capacidad ser iluminado por el sol espiritual y de acuerdo con el grado de su dignidad tendr el regocijo y la alegr a como si estuviese en el mismo aire y lugar y nadie ver la medida de lo superior e inferior para que al ver una mayor gracia en el otro y su propia insuficiencia no tenga fundamento para ponerse triste y perder ecuanimidad
6622437 donde est el cad ver moral ah se juntar n los buitres y le alcanzar el recto castigo
6622438 estad preparados porque no sab is a que hora vendr el hijo del hombre
6622439 la expresi n de su rostro les denuncia y sus pecados como sodoma manifiestan no se ocultan ay de ellos porque han merecido su propio mal

6622546 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6622547 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment

6622585 israeli soldiers enjoy an impunity that endangers many journalists covering their operations
6622586 israeli justice system has never taken proceedings against those allegedly responsible
6622587 the soldiers responsible for the death s of journalists raffaele ciriello 2002 imad abu zahra 2002 nazeh darouazi 2003 and james miller 2003 are still benefiting from an inexplicable impunity
6622588 chronic failure of the state of israel and its occupation forces to properly investigate hundreds of crimes they have committed against civilians in the opt

6622591 f rom the beginning of 2007 to mid 2008 btselem called for investigations to be opened into 99 cases in which 189 persons were killed up to the present only 4 military police investigations have been opened
6622592 independent investigations into killings of unarmed civilians by israeli forces are virtually never carried out even in cases where international outcry forces the military advocate generals office to look into the cases the process is limited and lacks any independence and impartiality in this case as in virtually all such cases witnesses were not interviewed no proper investigation was carried out into the cases of the 13 other unarmed civilians including eight children killed that day after palestinians had ambushed and killed three israeli soldiers

6622594 israeli soldiers and other members of the security forces as well as israeli settlers continued in 2007 to enjoy impunity for human rights abuses committed against palestinians including unlawful killings torture and other ill treatment physical assaults and attacks on their property
6622595 the decision to indict the soldiers on such trivial grounds transmits to officers and other soldiers an extremely grave message of contempt for human life and paves the way for future cases it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a systemic defect is involved one that has spread not only among idf officers but also among those responsible for enforcing law and order in the army
6622596 the policy of law enforcement bodies to date has been characterized by non intervention in violence by settlers against palestinians and their property
6622597 the common method of intimidation is setting dogs at children while they are grazing the sheep and goats or on their way to or from school in many cases of violence firearms are also used one of the most grievous cases of abuse took place when settlers spread poison in the grazing areas used by residents killing a number of sheep t he material was extremely poisonous and was liable to seep into the groundwater

6622683 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6622684 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6622685 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6622686 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6622689 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6622690 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6622691 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6622692 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6622694 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6622695 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6622696 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6622697 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6622698 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade

6622718 some of the polish friends i have consulted appreciate the occasional opportunity to keep in touch with their cultural roots but they do not think that a separate sunday liturgy would help in the important work of integration within the local catholic community this is also the view of the clergy in the area
6622719 we want to pay for the church and help to maintain it we dont want it for free
6622720 when you go to mass you have to feel like you are talking to god and expressing yourself to god you have to do that in your own language
6622721 you cannot take in a dictionary and translate the words
6622722 asking for a weekly mass is something basic and now we have to fight for it our religious life here is very basic its really the bare minimum many people in poland go to church on a daily basis
6622723 we know we are in england not in poland and we dont have to stay here
6622724 but we are here and if its possible for us to have mass then we would really appreciate it
6622725 many people including some poles felt it was becoming divisive
6622726 some poles felt that if there was polish mass they had a loyalty and they werent sure whether to go to the usual english mass
6622727 poles were not getting the opportunity to get to know the catholic community and the clergy werent getting the opportunity to get to know the polish people
6622728 maintain their own traditions and at the same time keep in touch with the english church

6622766 i love to go and pamper myself silly and eat so much korean barbecue
6622767 when you listen to the child ballads its some crazy old man in scotland and you know hes not smiling because the songs are all so horrible theyre so vicious and pagan even the ones that arent pagan im way more interested in these heavily stylized things like english countertenor alfred deller singing elizabethan minstrel songs its like butoh but way more text appropriate
6622768 im like i cant believe youre singing this like its nothing this is infanticide theres this texture of chilled out ness in folk music so i was trying to do a piece to insist on how nasty it is i want to own the murder jerry garcia made a recording of it its so dopey it plods along i mean they push her in and make a fiddle
6622769 someone took a girls body and made a violin like thats amazing it requires some focus were going to have bone were going to have flesh were going to have hair making that cut was the most fun thing ever it was crazy to do and it felt so delicious
6622770 when you think about classical composers you think about the composer being isolated
6622771 but with nico theres a social element thats really important
6622772 there was no score until the piece was done and its very harmonically complex i would mess something up and he clearly was so open to the moment that he would keep my accident laden version
6622773 you can get away with a breadth of influence there
6622774 people here there is no end to asking how do you reconcile this plus this its really boring people asking how do you bridge the two different worlds what worlds are you talking about

6622777 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6622778 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6622779 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans
6622780 for the ninth time in the past two years moving water industries categorically denies the highly inventive scurrilous and patently false allegations by the would be whistleblower maria garzino
6622781 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6622782 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample

6622788 mamas dont let your cowboys grow up to be babies
6622789 if someone says something that you dont agree with on your posts deal with it
6622790 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6622791 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6622792 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6622793 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6622794 put their talents to good use instead of destroying other peoples property
6622795 yeah i think a lot of people should do this a lot of people should have this on their store
6622796 spraying painting murals can deter future taggers from hitting this building by leaving it alone theyre paying respect to the people behind the work
6622797 normally in design bid build you wouldnt start building until the whole building was designed in our case we started and we were putting up bricks before design was fully complete
6622798 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6622799 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6622800 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6622801 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us

6622807 wed characterize vaxinnates m2e universal influenza vaccine candidate as very promising based upon the immune responses and tolerability we saw in the clinical trial participants
6622808 utmb is committed to further studies of vaxinnates vaccine candidate which has the potential to be a safe highly effective and much needed option to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza a
6622809 were very pleased with the study data which demonstrate that vaxinnates m2e universal flu vaccine candidate is safe and capable of eliciting a more potent immune response by delivering a one two punch that triggers both arms of the bodys immune defense
6622810 furthermore it accomplishes this at doses below a microgram of vaccine antigen and without the use of conventional adjuvants in short this vaccine candidate has passed a critical initial test with data that have exceeded our expectations
6622811 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6622812 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6622813 did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6622814 gene upshaws death creates a perfect storm of two huge issues for the union
6622815 first gene upshaw defined the players union over decades and now hes gone second even with him at the helm it would have been a difficult tough set of negotiations without him its going to be an even tougher challenge
6622816 after the merger i never had another i could never get another no cut contract
6622817 and i believed that if someone signed me to a contract they should be required to pay me
6622818 you guys are cattle and were the ranchers and ranchers can always get more cattle
6622819 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6622820 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6622821 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6622822 mamas dont let your cowboys grow up to be babies
6622823 despite her interest in feminist economics julie nelsons publication record is so impressive that she qualified for tenure at one of the top 30

6622829 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least

6622832 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6622833 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6622834 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6622835 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6622836 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6622837 when i hear the word elitist linked with barack obama to me that is a code word for uppity
6622838 i find it extremely offensive and john mccain should know better
6622839 wed characterize this influenza vaccine candidate as very promising based upon the immune responses and tolerability we saw in the clinical trial participants

6622841 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6622842 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are a number of years away

6622845 when a man receives hormone treatment initially the therapy works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6622846 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is commonly the first sign that the therapy is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6622847 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6622848 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have observed that thats not the case since current therapy acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6622849 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6622850 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6622851 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6622852 we observed that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6622853 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioral patterns
6622854 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction
6622855 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6622856 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6622857 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6622858 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6622859 from what i hear he was a pretty good player

6622868 mamas dont let your cowboys grow up to be babies
6622869 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
6622870 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
6622871 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
6622872 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour

6622874 usually in people taking moderate doses of the drug you see some sort of mild acne but in severe cases it can ulcerate
6622875 the doses this man was taking were within the doses that are used among bodybuilders
6622876 there is probably a dose effect with the steroids but its also dependent on how the individual reacts
6622877 it is questionable whether he will be able to start building muscle mass again he may not be able to perform the exercises due to the scarring

6622899 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards

6622905 the media should accept some responsibility for the current state of
6622906 the extensive use of editors has contributed significantly to the current impasse by flooding government with deliberate fishing expeditions and requests designed specifically to embarrass ministers
6622907 id like to see more sensible and less sensationalised reporting of the information released within an accurate context
6622908 the climate of disclosure the public service and the right to know
6622909 we should be entitled to know through designated procedures not leaks at the whim of someone in the system what government knows unless some harm to essential public interests would result governments need thinking space to weigh advice and make a decision then choose to act on the advice of this expert or that or not at all and to explain itself however a government serious about transparency should not be trying to limit what we know about the views of its experts by locking the papers up for 30 years when they will be released into open access disclosure of the assessments of government advisers no matter how this occurs should not endanger the prospect of frank and candid advice in future the government should be demanding this sort of advice from its public servants on an ongoing basis

6622959 its like when you tune into a golf game you want to know how tigers doing
6622960 i just have to be conscious of that i just have to be aware that people are always watching and especially young people are watching
6622961 its definitely made it a lot tougher but theres nothing wrong with that

6622968 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6622969 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6622970 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6622971 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6622972 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6622973 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6622977 were looking at my turbo centurion sitting at the bottom of 35 feet of water
6622978 as the engine quit and we were descending at about 2 thousand feet above the water and we have no engine so were going to go into the water and he asked me what was going to happen and i said youre going to get cold and youre going to get wet but youre not going to get killed
6622979 i knew i had to get near land because the waters about 48 degrees near ketchikan
6622980 we couldnt quite get to the shore but then the float plane picked us up and we crawled into the float plane

6622983 how i learned to stop worrying and love the communists
6622984 i was a real bigot when it came to china i had a lot of prejudices that i had to leave behind when i came to this place
6622985 i had to learn that they have their way and their political philosophy i respect that
6622986 intimate advisor to senior chinese leaders on the olympic movement
6622987 im the only american who rewrites speeches of communist party chieftains
6622988 this year we saw a 3 19 growth in the number of press conferences and a 3 78 increase in the number of attendants
6622989 given that the chinese government has lied through its teeth
6622990 the western media was clamoring for a comment the people who could comment were out of town their instinct was that you had to get everybody together to analyze what had happened
6622991 i think the chinese learned a lot from experiences like spielberg about how fast the news cycle is
6622992 forming consciences for faithful citizenship a call to political responsibility from the catholic bishops of the united states
6622993 i think catholic voters are every bit as diverse as every other kind of voter
6622994 in a voters guide released for the second time since 2006 the kansas catholic bishops make it clear that catholics would commit moral evil by voting for a candidate who embraces abortion euthanasia embryonic stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage when a morally acceptable candidate is available
6622995 such acts are judged to be instrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
6622996 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
6622997 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
6622998 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not toally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
6622999 if a democrat voted with the national rifle association two out of every three times no one in his right mind would call that person an advocate of gun control
6623000 caseys father contrary to the latest spin was not denied the right to speak at the 1992 convention because he didnt endorse bill clinton
6623001 the democrats with the help of their friends in the media will now use the pennsylvania pro abortion senator to sell the message that they have gotten beyond their anti catholic reputation that reputation which was played out in 1992 by delegates who wore anti papal buttons at the convention still sticks if they are serious about reaching out to catholics and jettisoning their anti catholic baggage once and for all they can allow a prominent catholic to speak in denver who is truly pro life that should be an easy choice to make given the small pool of eligible candidates
6623002 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6623003 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6623004 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6623005 john mccain has so many houses that he cant remember how many he owns
6623006 that doesnt give me confidence that he understands how hard it is for most mainers to pay for a home for their families every day john mccain shows that he is completely out of touch with regular americans whether hes offering billions more in tax breaks for the oil companies or declaring that multimillionaires are members of the middle class
6623007 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july

6623010 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right
6623011 absolutely not i have not seen that man for almost four weeks now
6623012 weve identified the fact that under another name she has several that she had used we were able to determine that she was previously convicted of making a phone call to a judge actually a judges clerk took the message threatening the judge
6623013 thats not true they have me mixed up with somebody else
6623014 ive had two blood transfusions im ok after i get a blood transfusion but after that blood passes then im weak again and thats why i was not in court today
6623015 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6623016 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right
6623017 my heart and prayers goes out to the families of the victim and the shooter
6623018 we all got together and decided were going to pass out white ribbons for his memory
6623019 my friends and i walked in and saw him fall to the ground
6623020 were trying to definitely rely on god to see us through this to give us the strength you know the power in numbers
6623021 a lot of us are going back to school tomorrow to say just because something bad like this happens its not going to shallow our school pride at all
6623022 our community is definitely showing their heart and central will prevail over this
6623023 this kind of incident doesnt need to overwhelm us and as the reports go away we are still going to be here helping folks in this long journey of recovery
6623024 that when the sun rises tomorrow theyre not alone and without hope
6623025 i knew i had to get there or arthur would have killed me
6623026 but that was one of the most satisfying tries of my career to score one like that in the best competition in the world in such a crucial match gave me a great feeling
6623027 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6623028 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6623029 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6623030 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6623031 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6623032 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6623033 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6623034 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6623035 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6623036 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6623037 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding
6623038 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6623039 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6623040 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6623054 we will do whatever is necessary we will track him down we will capture him we will bring him to justice and i will follow him to the gates of hell
6623055 we can be relatively optimistic about the odds that the courts will actually eliminate patents on intangibles like software there will be twelve judges hearing bilskis case and only five of them are guilty of bringing us into this mess and all twelve are aware that the supreme court will overturn a ruling that doesnt do enough

6623062 politicians love to turn their stories into great epics and sometimes they have to embellish to smooth out the story line
6623063 but now there are too many professional and amateur fact checkers
6623064 and there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information so you really cant get away with stretching the truth anymore
6623065 mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 16 year old bridget mccain
6623066 with mother teresas encouragement she brought her fourth child bridget home
6623067 the very hospital and in the very room where her husband was brought after being shot down and then beaten by a mob during the war
6623068 mrs mccain asked to see the operating room and her husbands cell but was turned down she took the rejection philosophically its 27 years later lets go on mrs mccain said
6623069 at some point thereafter she toured the hospital and did coincidentally end up in the senators room
6623070 everybody tells white lies but in the political world its a little different because it raises the question that if people lie about little things are they also going to lie about big stuff that really matters
6623071 if it happens once you can say its a memory problem but if theres a pattern there theres a problem
6623072 what if our kids have to work hard to get into the colleges theyre entitled to attend

6623074 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6623075 always the fear of disgracing his forebears hung over him
6623076 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
6623077 he feels his experiences and performance as a pow have finally permitted this to happen
6623078 felt fulfillment when his dad was introduced at a dinner as commander mccains father he had arrived
6623079 we choose the president and you cant do h t about it
6623080 murdoch would moon the queen of england if he thought he could make a buck
6623081 politicians lie when their lips starting to make movement you can take it for granted that they are lying

6623091 es que no pagan ni un peso de aranceles y van a seguir creciendo mientras que las f bricas nacionales tienen muchas veces que acudir al algod n nacional que el gobierno subsidia cuando podr a estar subsidiando una industria como la nuestra que est agobiada por el contrabando y el lavado de dinero es falta de coordinaci n en el estado
6623092 es un mito al que la industria se pega decir que el problema es el precio del algod n el problema es mucho mayor de competitividad con un pa s como la china con productos mucho m s bajos en econom as de escala es una estrategia equivocada estar en un segmento igual al de los chinos

6623104 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business
6623105 the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum
6623106 can you believe this hes f ing arresting me for saying f

6623110 im not out to sue or get money i just want them to drop this ticket yes i probably shouldnt have cussed in public but he took it way too far
6623111 when youre in uniform you have to uphold the laws its like if he was on the way home and saw a drunk driver he had to act
6623112 keadaan hari ini adalah hasil dari apa yang anda kerjakan dan lakukan di masa lalu apabila anda menghendaki hasil yang berbeda lakukan dan kerjakan yang berbeda berubahlah
6623113 unintelligent men who do not know me perfectly think that i the supreme personality of godhead krishna was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality due to their small knowledge they do not know my higher nature which is imperishable and supreme
6623114 i envy no one nor am i partial to anyone i am equal to all but whoever renders service unto me in devotion is a friend is in me and i am also a friend to him
6623115 the pure devotee is always within the core of my heart and i am always in the heart of the pure devotee my devotees do not know anything else but me and i do not know anyone else but them
6623116 even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the lord
6623117 the supreme lord has nothing to do and no one is found to be equal to or greater than him for everything is done naturally and systematically by his multifarious energies
6623118 that supreme abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by fire or electricity those who reach it never return to this material world
6623119 completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated this srimad bhagavatam propounds the highest truth which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart the highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all this beautiful bhagavatam compiled by the great sage vyasadeva in his maturity is sufficient in itself for god realization
6623120 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6623121 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year
6623122 if the default pricing formula was kept beyond next season it would create a real risk of processors making investment decisions that are economically unsustainable
6623123 introduction of an auction from the 2010 11 season will remove uncertainty for fonterra independent producers and for farmers
6623124 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6623125 weve chosen to partner with microsoft to compete effectively with rim
6623126 even with the growth in this market 90 percent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 percent
6623127 we want to reach out to people who dont have a smartphone not people who already love rim
6623128 going forward for premium fully featured devices wi fi is a requirement

6623130 ser mejor entregarle a la dian las llaves de los centros comerciales para que los administre
6623131 ich habe zu beginn der arbeit das bild eines freundschaftsraumes entworfen dieser text dient gewisserma en als skizze des grundrisses inwieweit es sich nur um meine skizze handelt oder ob auch noch darauf zur ckgreifen wird sich zeigen dieser raum wird jedoch garantiert nach abgabe dieser arbeit errichtet und mit leben gef llt werden wenn man sich schon seit weit mehr als 2000 jahren ber diese probleme den kopf zerbrechen kann muss es in der praxis ungemein spannend sein
6623132 oh hahahaha we were all kinda wondering what the heck was up with that jacket
6623133 un factor en general que constri e el mercado especialmente el transporte p blico y el carretera es que las normas no han permitido que diferentes marcas puedan comercializar sus productos con la din mica que tuvieron el a o pasado
6623134 lo importante es que la comunidad de norte de santander apoye al gobierno en el desarrollo de este esquema pues es la oportunidad para que el departamento tenga el suministro permanente de un producto de alt sima calidad y a precios muy competitivos
6623135 creo que vamos a recuperar un buen mercado perdido inicialmente ser a un 30 por ciento durante los dos primeros meses
6623136 ese esquema se va a caer porque nosotros vamos a seguir con el contrabando de gasolina y a venderla m s barata
6623137 you know when youre at war and you know you got a war on two fronts the first thing you think of is golf isnt it
6623138 there is no accountability so this is money that is secretive and unaccountable that is not a way to spend taxpayer dollars in fact it is an invitation to corruption
6623139 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6623140 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6623141 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6623142 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6623143 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6623144 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6623145 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6623146 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6623147 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6623148 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6623149 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6623150 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6623151 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6623152 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6623153 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6623154 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6623155 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6623156 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6623157 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6623158 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6623159 i walked a couple of holes late last night but my ace man caddy matt hauser took care of it for me
6623160 he did a good job i am a little tired obviously but its an exciting week to shoot 62 sunday and have your second child monday
6623161 i hope i can just try to carry the momentum on
6623162 but youre going to do that on a course like this
6623163 hopefully i can get out and get em tomorrow morning good greens and at least i kind of know a little bit what i need to do so hopefully i can keep it going tomorrow
6623164 it was really a kind of carefree attitude on the golf course and i think that kind of helped me
6623165 obviously i was more concerned about getting home on sunday and the next thing i know i made a bunch of birdies on the back nine and ended up with a great finish
6623166 when we look at the strategic threat picture when we look at patterns of criminal activity that all levels of government show when we look at what is ultimately going to involve limited resources we have to get to a point where we prioritize
6623167 we prioritize based upon threat vulnerability and consequence as we speak today theres nothing in the threat picture that would suggest an imminent emp attack
6623168 one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
6623169 which are essential to both our civilian and military capabilities
6623170 has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures that support the fabric of u s society and the ability of the united states and western nations to project influence and military power
6623171 several potential adversaries have the capability to attack the united states with a high altitude nuclear weapon generated electromagnetic pulse and others appear to be pursuing efforts to obtain that capability
6623172 a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication for example an adversary would not have to have long range ballistic missiles to conduct an emp attack against the united states such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the u s coast using a short or medium range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high altitude terrorists sponsored by a rogue state could attempt to execute such an attack without revealing the identity of the perpetrators iran the worlds leading sponsor of international terrorism has practiced launching a mobile ballistic missile from a vessel in the caspian sea iran has also tested high altitude explosions of the shahab iii a test mode consistent with emp attack and described the tests as successful iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
6623173 the recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent upon the recovery of others
6623174 the longer the outage the more problematic and uncertain the recovery will be it is possible for the functional outages to become mutually reinforcing until at some point the degradation of infrastructure could have irreversible effects on the countrys ability to support its population
6623175 at present our highest priorities are things like preventing nuke attacks as well as working with state and locals to build up their capability to prevent and respond to things like ied events or catastrophic natural disasters
6623176 as it relates to what our greatest preoccupation is were doing everything we can to try to prevent a nuclear or radiological attack on our soil that would have the most severe impact in terms of loss of life or economic consequence
6623177 the risk picture is ever changing theres nothing in the strategic threat picture today that tells us theres an imminent emp threat that could change down the road as whatever circumstances in the world evolve so i am not telling you that it might never be among the highest priorities weve actually looked at this issue and weve looked at the entire spectrum of issues that we have to contend with when it comes to homeland security but we have to prioritize were not in the business of being all things to all people at all times
6623178 creo que ya llego el momento de destruir tu nombre en el beso de otra boca

6623180 how do you talk to your clients about what they need but not pass on too much seo knowledge in the process
6623181 i dont worry about it as a consultant because i offer so much great advice i know theyll come back for more and when im working as an in house seo and sense this is happening i drop the agency immediately when i work with a good consultant to pick up work that i didnt have time for they are very forthcoming with knowledge and insight for the project
6623182 coming out later this summer and will talk about how to get excited about the layoff and what to do when it hits you

6623185 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6623186 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6623187 the obesity epidemic in australia is having a direct and catastrophic influence on increasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes
6623188 we know that obesity and type 2 diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6623189 governments must act outside of concern for their current electoral cycle to address the explosion of obesity and diabetes
6623190 estamos satisfechos porque creemos que podemos contribuir a solucionar un problema importante de la aviaci n de la regi n como es la presencia del gallinazo
6623191 ahora viene la parte m s compleja la parte cient fica estaremos trabajando fuertemente en ese sentido y esperamos estar a tono a mediados de septiembre
6623192 es muy simple cualquier persona con un m nimo de preparaci n puede realizar este trabajo
6623193 por fortuna en todo este tiempo no se produjo ninguna desgracia ya que los gallinazos ponen en riesgo la integridad de los pasajeros y tambi n la de los tripulantes
6623194 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6623195 ta me dando esporro pq a culpa nao minha e vc sabe disso
6623196 foda se eu acho q a culpa sua e se eu acho vai ser
6623197 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
6623198 al banco de la rep blica se le fue la mano en el aumento de las tasas de inter s
6623199 el emisor no debi responder con m s intereses a una inflaci n de oferta especialmente de alimentos subi las tasas la inflaci n no baj y la econom a qued congelada
6623200 probablemente las pr ximas decisiones del banco de la rep blica van a tener el componente adicional del crecimiento econ mico y no solo el de pol tica monetaria y control de la inflaci n pero lo hecho hasta el momento es acertado
6623201 no podemos dejar que la inflaci n vuelva a subir por encima del 10 por ciento porque bajarla ser a muy doloroso para el pa s
6623202 mientras la inflaci n no corrija y se siga generando el choque de oferta ser a comprensible incluso otra alza de tasas este a o mientras haya riesgos de alza del ipc y de aumentos exagerados de salarios para el 2009 eso ser a entendible
6623203 los arrendatarios se endeudaron demasiado cayeron en la tentaci n de comprar carros con la c dula y las tarjetas f ciles
6623204 hoy pagarle al banco cr ditos y tarjetas es prioritario porque de lo contrario los reportan y les bloquean el cupo para bandearse el pr ximo mes
6623205 pasamos de pagar 4 000 millones de pesos mensuales en promedio durante en el 2007 a 6 000 millones en junio pasado
6623206 es claro que las empresas est n despidiendo al personal y esto se evidencia en que dejan de pagar arriendo o empiezan a devolver los inmuebles para buscar uno m s econ mico
6623207 hay un volumen muy importante en construcci n en esos segmentos con un agravante al incrementarse tanto el valor del metro cuadrado los compradores deb an invertir alto y por ende fijar c nones demasiado altos
6623208 esto se nota en la desocupaci n de las viviendas que ya toma entre 4 y 5 meses para alquilarlas de nuevo
6623209 con esos c nones tan costosos la gente no se anima y el propietario se queda con el bien vacante entonces la nica alternativa es bajarle y perder
6623210 esta situacion es habitual cuando la econom a baja esperemos que sea m s corta que en la crisis anterior
6623211 en estratos exclusivos un bien de 200 metros vale entre 1 200 y 1 600 millones de pesos y apenas se consiguen inquilinos que paguen entre 6 y 8 millones mensuales de alquiler m s las cuotas de administraci n que implica un conjunto de este estrato
6623212 all la se al de alerta es para aquellos propietarios que prefieren arrendar directamente y que muchas veces no exigen ni fianzas ni p lizas de seguros hay que analizar con mucho cuidado a qui n se le entregan los bienes pues si no pagan o no quieren salir luego hay que empezar procesos de restituci n costosos y dispendiosos
6623213 hay quien no puede pero quiere pagar a ese se le ayuda a cumplir con la obligaci n pero otros se pasan de listos por eso hay que actuar ante el menor incumplimiento
6623214 ante la falta de ventas los comerciantes est n cerrando los establecimientos y devolviendo los locales pues sin ingresos es imposible pagar alquiler y administraci n
6623215 aunque no estamos alarmados todos estos s ntomas nos obligan a endurecer las pol ticas para minimizar los riesgos ya no podemos ser tan el sticos ni tan generosos al elegir a los inquilinos
6623216 solo as evitamos problemas como los que estamos empezando a ver hoy
6623217 aunque parezcamos odiosos analizar cuidadosamente los ingresos tambi n es un favor que se les hace a las familias y a los comerciantes
6623218 muchos colombianos quieren vivir en rosales o ciudad salitre con ingresos de 1 5 millones cuando es claro que el sueldo debe ser cuando menos el triple del alquiler siempre y cuando no tengan otras obligaciones colegios deudas etc o sea madre cabeza de familia
6623219 el proyecto de 17 pisos y m s de 17
6623220 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6623221 im really pleased i knew coming here that there would be a lot of attention on the ryder cup but i just had to try to get into the mind set of playing tournament golf
6623222 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6623223 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6623229 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
6623230 although a success of less tasteful appeal the famous line from the drama g tz von berlichingen
6623231 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6623232 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6623233 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6623234 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6623235 we are excited to reveal casino of the wind to the world the rockwell group who have been our architects since the beginning of 1996 have outdone themselves this may be their best work yet
6623236 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6623237 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6623238 realizar una visita de estado a varios pa ses de europa y lamento que no estar en el pa s para recibirlo porque estar a muy desilusionado de perderme su visita y por la reuni n que espero albergar en el a o 2009 con varios premios nobel le estoy escribiendo para suplicarle que posponga su viaje
6623239 no tiene una explicaci n racional no era una invitaci n oficial hubiera sido lindo que l arias lo recibiera pero no es necesario su santidad visita innumerables pa ses de europa y del sudeste asi tico sin que los reciba el presidente esto no ten a nada que ver con el gobierno
6623240 es dif cil entender qu tiene que ver una actividad del a o entrante con una visita privada para efectos espirituales y culturales por qu ese plan result ser exclusivo
6623241 we look at the floor of the mouth we look for any areas of injury anything thats swollen we look at the teeth and we look for any brown areas but we also look for white areas which mean the area of the tooth is a little bit weaker
6623242 you can find problems that started very early and prevent stuff thats going to cost more money in the long run
6623243 i think a lot of parents always thought it was their responsibility to get them to the dentist before kindergarten now theyre going to know they have to
6623244 it was a reminder to the parents oh yes lets get them into the dentist too
6623245 she did fine you know i guess shes probably been since she was 3 or 4 you know i think they do a really good job with those little kids coming in gets them relaxed for things later too
6623246 the strength of the victim and her mother this was a very difficult matter for them they brought it to closure and i think thats an important aspect
6623247 i think in generally some of the allegations and evidence that came in throughout the sentencing would take this out of the realm of an ordinary case
6623248 we woke up at 2 in the morning this morning its hard to take it all in i guess but we just got here and its been awesome so far i guess
6623249 it was really great something that i never wouldve thought i wouldve had and something that ill never get to do again so i think its just an awesome experience and ill treasure it for the rest of my life
6623250 it was great you get treated really great and the foods good and you get to meet all the people from around the world and its a great experience were really lucky
6623251 it feels really good ive been missing a lot of things and ive been gone for like 3 weeks or whatever and ive been kind of dying to be home i guess im glad to be here
6623252 obama appears to be a natural and longtime neoliberal centrist
6623253 conservatives continue to score points with the patriotism and military cards absurdly tarring obama as a far left opponent of american interests and security
6623254 any democratic presidential candidate no matter how centrist and compromising is going to be subjected to relentless charges of leftist weakness and questionable americanism
6623255 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
6623256 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
6623257 his plans for withdrawal have long been nauseatingly ambiguous and maddeningly deceptive
6623258 the corporate sponsored capitalism praising obama is repeating the same old classist democratic mistake
6623259 the democratic leadership council dlc the organization that produced such figures as bill clinton al gore joe lieberman and terry mccauliffe has long been pushing the party to forget blue collar voters and concentrate instead on recruiting affluent white collar professionals who are liberal on social issues the larger interests that the dlc wants desperately to court are corporations capable of generating campaign contributions far out weighing anything raised by organized labor the way to collect the votes and more important the money of these coveted constituencies new democrats think is to stand rock solid on say the pro choice position while making endless concessions on economic issues on welfare nafta social security labor law privatization deregulation and the rest of it such democrats explicitly rule out what they deride as class warfare and take great pains to emphasize their friendliness with business like the conservatives they take economic issues off the table as for working class voters who were until recently the partys very backbone the dlc figures they will have nowhere else to go democrats will always be marginally better on economic issues than republicans besides what politician in this success worshipping country really wants to be the voice of poor people
6623260 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
6623261 and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone for 25 years and theres nothings to replace them and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them
6623262 dont they get that the democrats are the party of the workers and the poor
6623263 race neutral obama has exhibited a disturbing tendency to eagerly join the white post civil rights majority in blaming blacks for their disproportionate presence at the bottom
6623264 you know what people really mean when they say obama is bourgeois and elitist dont you
6623265 obama supporters have been disposed to cry foul and charge racism at nearly any criticism of him
6623266 doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills
6623267 carter mondale dukakis the clintons and gore did not need to be black in order to walk the same basic tiresome centrist line trod by the new black clinton
6623268 because hes white barack cant because hes black and thats scary enough in and of itself for white voters
6623269 re establishing confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order
6623270 by the end of his life king had concluded that only revolutionary change could save the u s from an ever deepening descent into repressive authoritarianism
6623271 labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of society a little change here a little change there
6623272 a reconstruction of the entire society a radical redistribution of political and economic power
6623273 is that he is some sort of anti establishment revolutionary rather every stage of his political career has been marked by an eagerness to accommodate himself to existing institutions rather than tear them down or replace them
6623274 the truth is that in obama a worried establishment has found the vessel through which they hope to restore international and domestic stability
6623275 elected officials are only as good or as bad as the forces they feel they must respond to its a mistake to expect any more of them than to be vectors of the political pressures they feel working on them
6623276 we need to think about politics in a different way one that doesnt assume that the task is to lobby the democrats or give them good ideas and correct their misconceptions
6623277 its a mistake to focus so much on the election cycle we didnt vote ourselves into this mess and were not going to vote ourselves out of it electoral politics is an arena for consolidating majorities that have been created on the plane of social movement organizing its not an alternative or a shortcut to building those movements and building them takes time and concerted effort not only can that process not be compressed to fit the election cycle it also doesnt happen through mass actions it happens through cultivating one on one relationships with people who have standing and influence in their neighborhoods workplaces schools families and organizations it happens through struggling with people over time for things theyre concerned about and linking those concerns to a broader political vision and program this is how the populist movement grew in the late nineteenth century the cio in the 1930s and 1940s and the civil rights movement after world war ii it is how weve won all our victories and it is also how the right came to power
6623278 we didnt vote ourselves into this mess and were not going to vote ourselves out of it
6623279 the u s presidential race impassioned almost to the point of hysteria hardly represents healthy democratic impulses
6623280 americans are encouraged to vote but not to participate more meaningfully in the political arena essentially the election is yet another method of marginalizing the population a huge propaganda campaign is mounted to get people to focus on these personalized quadrennial extravaganzas and to think thats politics but it isnt its only a small part of politics
6623281 the urgent task for those who want to shift policy in progressive direction often in close conformity to majority opinion is to grow and become strong enough so that that they cant be ignored by centers of power
6623282 so in the election sensible choices have to be made but they are secondary to serious political action the main task is to create a genuinely responsive democratic culture and that effort goes on before and after electoral extravaganzas whatever their outcome
6623283 should i vote tactically for obama to block mad bomber mccain since i live in a contested state
6623284 i think im just going to sit the election out what do you think
6623285 struggling with people over time for things theyre concerned about and linking those concerns to a broader political vision and program
6623286 calm things down and re establish confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order
6623287 americans progressive opinion vs the shadow cast on society by business

6623299 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6623300 los empresarios sienten que si no usan las mismas herramientas pueden quedar relegados de los negocios por eso ven el soborno como una pr ctica m s dentro del esquema
6623301 la encuesta evidencia que se requieren mejores controles internos y auditor as en las empresas para prevenir el soborno una pr ctica que sin duda es dif cil de controlar
6623302 las grandes cuentan con mejores condiciones para implementar pr cticas que prevengan el soborno y est n m s dispuestas a hacerlo mientras que las medianas y las peque as todav a no se ven en esa onda
6623303 la primera condici n de responsabilidad social para una empresa es ser transparente y eso implica que todo el proceso interno debe serlo
6623304 lo malo es que no son muchas las compa as que manifiestan contar con pr cticas para prevenir el soborno
6623305 aqu se ve la doble moral de los empresarios por un lado ponen el grito en el cielo cuando hablan de corrupci n y por el otro no reprimen las malas conductas y prefieren quedarse callados

6623309 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6623310 you need more shots of people even if its just you
6623311 you watch tape on him and you get a feel for him but to see the way he practices
6623312 he practices extremely hard and he carries it over to the game and he plays very fast
6623313 hes not a prima donna hes not a guy who feels like ive got to be treated a certain way and that makes my job a lot easier and it makes coach
6623314 when one of your best players is a guy who buys into what youre trying to get accomplished youve got a chance and hes been exceptional
6623315 injuries as you know are the thing that you cant predict
6623316 but based on the way he plays now and the way he prepares because hes not a guy whos just physically talented he really works on the game from a mental standpoint as well watching tape studying opponents talking to other players in the league about offensive lineman and what they like to do and what their weaknesses are hes a student of the game and with his athletic ability the skys the limit
6623317 no evidence supports wards contention that he engaged in his behavior to further a journalistic investigation
6623318 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6623319 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6623320 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6623321 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6623322 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6623323 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

6623331 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6623413 if husain had fought to quench his worldly desires as alleged by certain christian critics then i do not understand why his sister wife and children accompanied him it stands to reason therefore that he sacrificed purely for islam
6623414 in a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of husain will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader
6623415 of that gallant band male and female knew that the enemy forces around were implacable and were not only ready to fight but to kill denied even water for the children they remained parched under the burning sun and scorching sands yet not one faltered for a moment husain marched with his little company not to glory not to power of wealth but to a supreme sacrifice and every member bravely faced the greatest odds without flinching
6623416 the best lesson which we get from the tragedy of karbala is that hussain and his companions were the rigid believers of god they illustrated that numerical superiority does not count when it comes to truth and falsehood the victory of hussain despite his minority marvels me

6623422 it wasnt at least not until much later in the beginning in the very beginning there was still order and civilization there were still things of beauty
6623423 it is not the har you killed who is unquiet the trouble lies within yourself look inwards to find the answers
6623424 if you didnt want to discuss it you wouldnt have brought it up
6623425 you know where we come from you know who we come from we build shrines to his memory and yet he walks among us still we tell the tale of his genesis to awe struck harlings as if it were already myth mutated by time distant and unverifiable and yet it is not myth but fact a real life
6623426 it is sometimes easy to forget that all history is real lives lived by real people perhaps it is important for those who remember those lives to pass their remembrances on so that they will not perish on the sword of mythology
6623427 you know of the end of mankind the crumbling decaying cities and the wretched creatures who inhabited them that was how it was for some for many but not for all if youre bored ashmael we can move onto some meditative techniques to help you visualize your inner turmoil
6623428 no i was just visualizing the decaying cities and wretched creatures were you a wretched creature arahal
6623429 no i was not i was as far from being a wretched creature as it is possible to get i was among the privileged and cosseted and i lived a life of ease and comfort dedicated to learning it was a lie of course outside our little sealed bubble the cities were decaying and something strange and new was beginning to take root but inside we could pretend that nothing had changed and that civilisation would continue exactly as it had always done we thought we could hold back the tide we were wrong
6623430 there was nothing that mankind could do to save themselves their time was at an end and ours was beginning but they did not come for me i went to them i went to him
6623431 thiede never involved himself directly with the creation of our race at least not after the first inception he left that to others one other in particular in fact it was orien who realized the incredible possibility and what had to be done to achieve it as well he might since he was the first inceptee
6623432 dreams are a way in which our minds can access other dimensions
6623433 in them we can find connections both to others of our kind and to ourselves if we know how to use them properly
6623434 i dismissed them at first of course during my waking hours i put all thought of those strange recurring dreams from my mind yet every night in my head that insistent voice called to me speaking to me of things beyond all my limited experience
6623435 naturally i assumed i was going mad and some research through the heavy academic tomes in the library only seemed to confirm this diagnosis
6623436 you cant solve all your problems by swinging your fist at them
6623437 its considered highly unethical to eavesdrop on another hars private thoughts
6623438 ah so youre not as perfect as you pretend to be
6623439 i have never pretended to be perfect we all have our flaws the trick is to be aware of them
6623440 being aware of them is not much good if you dont do anything to correct them
6623441 quite so its very heartening to see you making such progress ashmael
6623442 why are you so smug its not such an unusual thing
6623443 few hara admit to having had such relationships prior to their inception
6623444 that is one path there are others tell me about the har you killed
6623445 i think youll find what youre looking for over there
6623446 we were celebrating reaptide they were celebrating reaptide i had drunk a little too much barley wine the night before and id had an argument with lorril so i stayed in bed
6623447 three days ago a strange har came to our village he wanted food and shelter so we gave him it he also wanted a companion for the night but nohar was interested we are a small community most of us have
6623448 in time my family and my chesnari will come back to life again
6623449 i told you what happened it was important to do that
6623450 yes it was a terrible crime has been committed here and its important that your friends and family obtain justice that is why you must come to immanion youre the only one left youre the only one who knows what happened
6623451 then why did you choose a new name for yourself when you became har
6623452 oh well pardon me for not being as special and unique as pellaz
6623453 not everyhar can aspire to be as awesome as our tigron
6623454 would you care to be a little more vague about that
6623455 im not being vague everything i have told you is the truth its how you interpret it that matters
6623456 to me the fact that i could discern someone speaking to me in my mind was true to my colleagues the fact that there was no voice to be heard was equally true
6623457 they simply did not possess the skill or ability to hear it themselves that does not mean it was not there to be heard
6623458 and what of those who cannot hear but believe none the less is that truth or merely blind faith
6623459 and then there is gullibility its always wise to be able to tell one from the other
6623460 no one could ever accuse you of being gullible my friend a little healthy scepticism is no bad thing but if none of us ever took that leap in the dark over the cliff of reason we would miss many opportunities
6623461 so it was faith that led you to follow the voices
6623462 quite so i was not brave ashmael i was young and inexperienced and filled with fear of the outside world i would not have ventured forth alone sometimes the greater part of achieving a goal is not believing in it yourself but having someone else believe in you
6623463 that i think is what the tribes of cordagne might refer to as a
6623464 if you say so ash perhaps a little shared psychosis is necessary to start great events in motion at any rate the sane ones stayed behind and look where it got them
6623465 of course not i may have been verging on madness allegedly but i was far from being witless it was forbidden to go to the city it was a dangerous place im sure you remember how things were
6623466 arahal i am shocked that a har of your unimpeachable standing and reputation should admit to larceny
6623467 ash do try not to look quite so much like a virgin harling who has just discovered the manner in which his parents created him besides you know perfectly well that if we all owned up to our youthful indiscretions there would scarcely be a har in immanion with his reputation intact yourself included
6623468 i would defend my honour vigorously but unfortunately you were at that party too as i remember
6623469 yes i was and photography is not an art lost to wraeththukind and i do have the negatives therefore i feel quite comfortable in telling you in the sure and certain knowledge that it will go no further that we smashed open the side window of an expensive vehicle performed a useful trick involving an electrical short circuit in order to start the motor without recourse to the official key and drove off without either of us ever having gone through the formality of acquiring the necessary licencing to do so
6623470 abandoned for the most part decaying those who remained represented the very dregs of human society
6623471 we ran out of fuel before we reached our destination we had to leave the car and continue on foot we were already deep in the ruins there was no possibility of turning back we simply had to keep going we knew we were being followed we could hear noises the occasional mis step of a foot on a loose brick or stone rustlings scurryings what may or may not have been laughter occasionally we would catch a fleeting glimpse of something out of the corner of our eye but it would vanish in the very instant we turned to look
6623472 the buildings were crumbling but they absorbed the heat of the sun they seemed to suck it in capture it and hold it there were dead things among the ruins that much was obvious animals dogs cats humans too almost certainly the smell of death was all around the city was dying its buildings and its inhabitants succumbing to the same disease
6623473 eventually one of the creatures who had been stalking us gained enough courage to show himself even for a man he was ugly a degenerate specimen clothed in filthy tattered rags in his hand he held a lump of wood crudely fashioned into a club and he brandished it at us threateningly behind him a few more of these creatures still lurked within the protective crevices of the buildings i do not think they were an organised group of any sort our assailant was not their leader the others were merely waiting to see what would happen and what the outcome of this confrontation would be
6623474 i will not claim that i was not afraid i had led a peaceful life up until that point sheltered from this sort of savagery and i had no experience of fighting and yet it is remarkable what one can do when ones very existence is threatened besides there were two of us both well fed young and healthy when he rushed us we stood our ground and attacked him back one on either side he did not stand a chance he was a miserable specimen malnourished and riddled with who knows what diseases my companion kicked his legs out from under him and as he fell to the ground i snatched his makeshift club from him and thrust my boot into his chest pinning him to the ground
6623475 i could see the terror in his eyes as i stood over him his mouth was open gaping and i could see that what few teeth remained were brown and broken i could smell the foulness of his body and his breath and i stood there with the club in my hand thinking that it would be a merciful release if i were to dash his brains out there and then and end his miserable life for it was no life at all merely an existence
6623476 he could tell what i was thinking of that i was certain he stared at the club in my hand raised ready to strike and i steeled myself to do what was necessary
6623477 i was not in any immediate danger at that point and it was not my right to decide whose life was worth living or not i let him go
6623478 it was enough to convince the rest of our followers they melted away into the rubble and we continued on into the dead heart of the city i began to wonder exactly what i had done i had left the cloistered safety of wood panelled halls and libraries and come to this place an underworld of nightmares more fully realised than any description in a book and i had brought with me the one person i cared for most in the world putting us both in considerable danger
6623479 if it had not been for my companions encouragement and determination i doubt that i would have had the courage to continue i would have fled back the way we had come becoming lost in the grim and poisonous landscape and no doubt eventually falling prey to one of the more determined of the citys inhabitants but the two of us together managed to maintain some semblance of courage we took it in turns to reassure the other clinging to the belief that we would find what we were looking for as grimly as drowning rats clinging to a piece of driftwood
6623480 however as you have kindly pointed out merely believing in something is not enough we were naive to think that we could find the source of my dream voices in that vast citys carcass we did not have the knowledge or the ability we were stumbling around blind lost in many ways our situation was a metaphor for the plight of all humanity dont give me that look ashmael sometimes the symbolic is a useful tool in ones quest for inner understanding and as with them it took an outside force to rescue us from the blind alley we found ourselves in you may decide for yourself whether the alley is metaphorical or not
6623481 i take it you are not talking about thiede metaphorically or otherwise
6623482 everything our species does or says is about thiede metaphorically but in the literal sense it was orien who discovered us in the ruins
6623483 i recognised him immediately even though this was the first time i had seen him but i recognised him his essence his soul from my dreams even if i had not i would have know that he was not human in many ways he looked like all the other wretched inhabitants of this vile place his clothing was torn and soiled he had a feral look about him a wild uncivilised thing living among the squalour and the dirt and yet he was har that is all that needs to be said he carried a light with him inside him and around him he was a thing of beauty in a place of ugliness and my companion and i fell to our knees in awe
6623484 naturally he had no time for this sort of nonsense and he quickly hurried us away from that place to the basement of one of the nearby buildings
6623485 somewhere close by but far enough away that he did not know of oriens plans
6623486 orien was a wise har and an inspiration to many
6623487 eventually perhaps but in the beginning he was a fanatic he seized upon the accidental gift which had been bestowed upon him with all the fervour of a newly converted religious zealot he saw that where there had been one and now two there could be many and so he gathered us together in his basement there were twelve of us and we were to be his experiment
6623488 did he call to the others like he did with you
6623489 and so he assembled us there his experimental group twelve human subjects and inoculated us with his own blood he said that we would become like him and if you had seen him there an angel amidst all the filth and horror that surrounded us you would have made the same choice that we made too and gladly we did not know what was to come we only knew what we were leaving behind come enough talk it is time
6623490 oh come on ash its not like you to be so unconvincing
6623491 well i learned some new uses for them at any rate
6623492 and i learned that you have a smug and supercilious way about you which can be very irritating
6623493 and dont think that inserting a very obvious piece of self deprecation makes you look any better
6623494 i learned how to make you scream and beg me to stop and then beg for more
6623495 by making me aware of its presence every second of every day
6623496 there would be little point in wearing it if it did not
6623497 i dont think much of your analogy arahal you could remove that if you really wanted to you choose to wear it i dont choose to have to see visions of a dead har
6623498 the dehara are not quite so generous to some with their gifts as they have been to you and i
6623499 yes quite let us not dwell any further upon their misfortune
6623500 there speaks the voice of a har who is rarely soume however if this misapprehension of yours is the source of your dissatisfaction i can recommend a har who will more than fill your needs so to speak
6623501 im not interested that sort of thing doesnt attract me at all how unique
6623502 so you have got a sense of humour after all
6623503 here i believe this is yours it could do with a clean
6623504 you know arahal you are slightly stranger than i had previously given you credit for
6623505 how should i know you were the one who invoked aruhani
6623506 perhaps or perhaps aruhani wishes you to know that death is nothing to be fearful of it is only the inverse of life one cannot exist without the other
6623507 the dead har and his family are your responsibility now ashmael
6623508 how can they be my responsibility if they are dead
6623509 you are the only one who knows what happened to them how they lived and how they died you must keep that memory alive preserve it within yourself
6623510 i can do that i suppose it is not such an onerous burden
6623511 no it isnt now get dressed its time for you to go
6623512 im not leaving until you tell me the rest of your story
6623513 i knew you were going to say that very well sit down over there yes do please put your trousers on its highly distracting
6623514 i know exactly where i was ashmael now where was i
6623515 i do not recall much of what transpired after orien infected us with his blood but i have two memories as vivid as if they happened yesterday and as sharp as the knife he used to open the vein in my arm
6623516 i remember the pain if a harish life span is counted as a thousand years and i live every one in full i will never forget the pain those who came after were more fortunate there were drugs to numb the agony but for us the first there was no such comfort it was like being flayed alive both inside and out it was like being consumed by fire and acid every nerve of my body screaming over and over again to have it stop
6623517 and i remember the one who came to us and took pity on us in our agony and laid his hands upon us and made the pain bearable as we squirmed and writhed in that dank place
6623518 afterwards when it was over i awoke and lay calmly among the squalour and knew that the world was now a different place everything had changed everything and nothing the world outside looked superficially the same as it had done before all filth and ugliness and death but i had changed in ways which i could not possibly have comprehended only three days previously i was reborn in that foetid cellar made new and whole no longer the pathetic half creature that is a human being my hands explored my body and told me what my eyes in the gloom could not
6623519 orien was there to greet us his newborn children he was immensely proud of his achievement i could tell he felt himself a god who could create new life and who is to say that he was wrong i could feel the essence of his being far more strongly now it was as if my previous connection with him had been through a great snowstorm with a howling wind in my ears deafening me and he so far away but now everything was sharp and focused i could see and hear and feel every little detail of him and of the others of our kind in that basement it was a wondrous moment and i lay there slowly coming to my senses luxuriating in the sheer joy of it all
6623520 what about your friend was he as thrilled to become har as you were
6623521 my friend was right next to me lying against my side i turned to look but i already knew
6623522 and we are supposed to feel guilty if one particular death feels more like a tragedy than others
6623523 i dont know are we is that the gelaming way
6623524 yes but you have to understand that my feelings were very mixed sadness and anger certainly but also the elation of my own transformation it was unsettling
6623525 orien explained to us that those who had died had given their lives in a very noble cause
6623526 yes he could but he was right about one thing my friends death was not meaningless or rather we had within us now the opportunity to ensure that it had a meaning and a purpose
6623527 there were four of us who survived we burned the bodies of the others and moved on to another location in time we would incept more and the fatality rate declined steeply we did not attempt to incept any more females
6623528 and you wear that chain to remind you of her death
6623529 no to remind me of her life the one she would have had male and female entered that basement room male and female left it i was given a new life hers ended there all that she would have been and would have experienced i would have to experience it for her now i was given a gift and it is my responsibility my duty to be aware of that every moment of every day for if i ever forget it then her sacrifice was in vain and she is truly dead if i remember then her life continues through me it is the very least i can do
6623530 is that how you see the purpose of our lives then as noble avatars of all the lost and disappointed souls who never achieved their lifes purpose
6623531 live you life the best way you know how its all any of us can do
6623532 words to live by i shall endeavour to experience lifes pleasures all the more acutely from this day forth
6623533 do you think i will see the dead har again
6623534 i wouldnt think so but even if you do would it bother you
6623535 you have made peace with his spirit within you you have told his story
6623536 was that what he wanted for me to tell you
6623537 i dont know it was never about him though it was always about you
6623538 i have told you nothing you didnt already know within yourself
6623539 no i mean thank you for telling me your story you didnt have to
6623540 perhaps i did perhaps it was time i have told no one else in all these years perhaps i should thank you
6623541 you have really kept this to yourself all this time
6623542 there never seemed to be an appropriate time to discuss it until now
6623543 you are a surprising har arahal i wonder what other secrets you keep hidden

6623570 the growing trade in virtual water means that scarcity in one region can be compensated for by increased production in places with more plentiful supplies
6623571 globally there is adequate fresh water available and that looks set to continue in the long term figures from the fao indicate that we currently extract less than 10 per cent of the 43 750 cubic kilometers of fresh water returned each year to the earths rivers lakes and aquifers the water is not distributed evenly of course within a given country water consumption can vary from less than 1 percent of available resources to more than 100 percent meaning that in some cases resources are being overexploited and degraded
6623572 nations can thrive on surprisingly meager quantities of fresh water

6623636 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6623637 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6623638 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6623639 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

6623663 it would not make sense to invest big efforts and resources on homeless services if we dont do enough to prevent homelessness occurring or recurring
6623664 we would all be failing in our duty if we did not ask whether we can get a better return from these resources in meeting the needs of homeless people it is the people affected by homelessness who have most to lose if we do not maximise value for money and efficiency in homeless services

6623730 it gives you a gauge that there are some low numbers out there and you can go and be aggressive and attack
6623731 this round was just some made putts at some key times and some nice up and downs of ones that i wouldnt normally be getting today i was chipping to gimme range whereas before i was chipping them to five feet and missing some of the putts
6623732 i was kind of bummed when we werent there anymore but when i got here i loved it it doesnt really play as short as the card says the greens are perfect and fast and theres some rough if you hit it in the rough off the tee youre scrambling to hit it somewhere where you can try and chip it within eight feet and make a good putt
6623733 i hit a sand wedge to about 10 feet long on no 17
6623734 i was literally trying to hit the putt six inches and it just wiggled down it looked like it was going to miss and then it drifted in it was one of those days where that kind of putt is falling
6623735 it was as perfect as it could be for playing golf
6623736 i think the pace will slow down as the week goes on the course gets bouncier and harder the greens are very tricky if you get above the hole youve got to get it in play off the tee theres a couple of holes where i hit it off line and into the rough and i really had no chance to hit it close i had half a chance to get it on the green but if youre not in play off the tee youre really going to struggle

6623743 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6623744 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6623745 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6623746 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future

6623793 this document is a unique bilateral military plan to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to the other nations requests for military support of civil authorities
6623794 unity of effort during bilateral support for civil support operations such as floods forest fires hurricanes earthquakes and effects of a terrorist attack in order to save lives prevent human suffering an mitigate damage to property is of the highest importance and we need to be able to have forces that are flexible and adaptive to support rapid decision making in a collaborative environment
6623795 the signing of this plan is an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between canada command and u s northern command
6623796 our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty first century

6623845 it becoming late we gave over by mutual conviction of its being unavailing all exclaiming it will not burn there was a bright flame round it occasioned by the moisture still flowing from it and on removing the furnace nearer to the sea to immerse the iron i took the heart in my hand to examine it after sprinkling it with water yet it was still so hot as to burn my hand badly and a quantity of this oily fluid still flowed from it

6623850 from age 2 or 3 to 5 children have such vivid imaginations children have such vivid imaginations but then they go to school and are made to feel that they should think and act like everyone else and they seem to lose their individual imaginations and draw what is expected of them
6623851 recently in our science class we were asked to draw a picture of a scientist
6623852 when we handed it in our teacher got what she expected mostly all of us had drawn men with white lab coats and tubes with liquids in them
6623853 if you asked us to draw popular kids wed draw them with makeup and nice clothes and big houses if you asked us to draw farmers wed draw men with overalls baseball caps and straw in their mouths
6623854 although there are still stereotypical responses given when children are asked to draw a scientist if you interview them they will qualify their work by saying they had to draw it that way so that you know what it is
6623855 there seems to be very little in the national curriculum on the nature of science who does it and why
6623856 a discussion around these areas might make children think more widely about who is a scientist and what scientists actually do
6623857 i do not see a problem with children drawing pictures of scientists as men in white coats we do need to know what childrens perceptions are before we can change them we do need to know what childrens perceptions are before we can change them
6623858 moreover everyone likes to build myths and interesting characteristics around scientific personalities to set them aside as somehow different from the rest of us
6623859 it is important to challenge children in their thinking and the adults who work with them
6623860 what image do children have of other rare breeds such as say theologians or historians
6623861 and insofar as children do think about scientists their image is probably colored much more by the biosciences than previously
6623862 the students seemed genuinely interested in what was being said any well presented information seems to strike their imagination and make them interested in the subject
6623863 i do think that children are intimidated by science perhaps not the younger ones but as they get older
6623864 most children seem to think of a doctor as someone who studies science and he is in white garb
6623865 children think of scientists as smart albeit a bit weird as shown by the hair and dedicated to the profession if anything should be done it is to have more interaction between the scientific community and the public
6623866 it may be one of the things that turns a young childs eyes toward science in the first place
6623867 in a video show at school for instance would kids watch a normal scientist for even 15 minutes
6623868 with everything else a kid could watch these days thats a small miracle

6623879 we have formally contacted the australian commonwealth games association to express our interest
6623880 they have indicated that in the next few months they will decide whether australia will bid for the 2018 commonwealth games or future commonwealth games so i was keen to put our hand up early
6623881 however while these projects are significant there is no doubt more work will need to be done if we are to be successful in our bid

6623883 these figures highlight the global success of mobile broadband and the fact that we are continuing to see greater and greater economies of scale
6623884 this is driving down the cost of devices and equipment and enabling more and more users across the world to enjoy easy access to media rich services anywhere at anytime
6623885 technical difficulties carrier agreements and the general economic climate have been the main reasons for the delays
6623886 for many pnd vendors cellular connectivity is a completely new project representing a huge challenge in terms of implementation the development of new services and the negotiation of agreements with carriers moreover the worsening economic climate the slowdown of the pnd market growth and the profitability issues faced by most vendors have resulted in connected pnds ranking lower on all parties priority lists
6623887 this means that as soon as non critical water is identified it can be seized the water holders compensated and the water used to revive the murray the darling and the lower lakes
6623888 that is in the long term interests of all the farmers and the communities that depend on our rivers not just south australians

6623893 i did not have people coming to me saying you must support this industry
6623894 on the contrary i was overwhelmed with people suggesting that this is not compatible with the aspirations of this community
6623895 i came to the conclusion that it was time to make a stand and ask the government to also make a declaration that they would protect the community
6623896 the premier is taking a close interest in this project
6623897 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6623898 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6623899 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6623900 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6623901 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6623902 when we get those in i am quite sure we will be more efficient we want to get a return for our investment and we will cut fares as much as we can

6623906 particularly in the past hes had some injuries and we just dont want to risk bringing him back early
6623907 so far ims has mainly been deployed to support fixed line voip services rather than multimedia services likely because ims multimedia services to date have shown varying degrees of success as service providers accelerate their transition to voip to more efficiently compete and as more of them experiment with new mobile and multimedia services ims will be the glue that bridges their heterogeneous networks together and assures standardization of those services
6623908 as new features have been developed for fleet management systems the focus has moved from simply providing data for fleet managers to the addition of summary reports for senior management
6623909 for example driver performance monitoring electronic documentation and engine monitoring all add value to the basic systems as new features such as these have been added the benefits support more aspects of running a business
6623910 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6623911 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6623912 they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country
6623913 i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6623914 this is ridiculous we have all the evidence pointing to him yet the authority thinks otherwise
6623915 all this is tearing me and my wife apart we are experiencing an emotional roller coaster ride
6623916 as far as i am concerned we have not concluded the case who is the policewoman who contacted the family
6623917 everything is so misleading and we are in the dark it seems we are not getting much information and help from the police
6623918 one of the teachers called some indian students derogatory names
6623919 my 10 year old son was lifted up by the ears by a male teacher and slapped and kicked for talking before entering the classroom after recess in february
6623920 these are young impressionable children and the alleged incidents will only teach them to hate
6623921 today the prosperity among indian men begins at an early age where they are slightly balding confident mature and wealthy at this prime of their career they are going for cosmetic surgeries skin toning facials and massage which we have never heard them doing before
6623922 its natural to be attracted by a young secretary or a female employee in your office who works closely with you taking care of your business and projects
6623923 the pieces are doll houses covered with vacuum cleaner dust the architecture of the houses is carefully selected to match them with familiar urban landscapes i take them apart and discard some of the decorative elements so these houses end up almost as a sketch of the original or as a new house in the process of been built with no doors no windows and no flowers when the dust comes the whole house and the windows and the flowers are being replaced by dirt the houses are fully covered so they began to have a gray scale quality they look monochromatic almost like a block minimal but once you start getting closer you begin to first smell then to see the hair the skin the lint the debris you have a physical experience you realize that there is so much poetry in such ugliness
6623924 what i proposed was winding what amounts to mylar film around the 330m diameter the asteroid

6623931 there are many churches out there that sing the last stanza of have thine own way just one more time as they wait for the convicted sinner to step out of the pew and into a new relationship with christ but even though it is still somewhat popular we think that the invitation system has done more harm than good among many evangelical churches
6623932 we have yet to see fully the consequences of real economy events flowing back into the financial markets
6623933 were in the process in which investors are starting to establish in their own mind expectations of what those real economy issues will do to the earnings power and valuations in the financial sector
6623934 were in the middle of that adjustment process but were certainly not through it
6623935 the problem was that our own philosophy was not rigorously applied not that the philosophy was wrong
6623936 in general we have been understaffed in our supervisory functions for the larger institutions and we are addressing that
6623937 were looking for a global approach to change the remuneration structure
6623938 weve already encouraged our institutional shareholders here to put pressure on companies to deal with the issue

6624076 you dumb people should stop produce children whom you have no means of educating and clog up our economy with people too stupid to be in management and too lazy to do manual work
6624077 hey man the short answer is that the dolls were part of a drawing project that was exploring sentinel moments or memories from my childhood mostly they were negative but one of the positive memories was playing with dolls as a way to escape i was doing drawings from memory and i could not get the drawings from the dolls to feel right so i photographed the dolls and me playing with them to see if that would help then i began to explore the memory and try to re create the mental image rather than the physical image thats when i started making progress i realized what would make me the happiest is if i could create images as if they were screen shots from my mind play the background is that i felt isolated we lived in southeast alabama with no real connections three brothers and a sister i knew i was different from an early age i reasoned differently and my affinities were different as well luckily my neighbors had played with dolls and had a series of foster kids who did as well so i was able to get cast offs from them i would use the dolls as proxies for people they had their own world i used whatever was around me to make a little dirt village out back when my brothers destroyed every thing i would make i learned to find hiding places in the woods where i could go and they could not touch me
6624078 its really interesting to think of your photographs as images taken directly from your childhood imagination which i know for me was a very powerful almost engulfing part of myself this also makes me realize how biographical these works are in essence you were creating your own dreamworld in which it was normal for two men to be together because you could not see any examples of this in reality that is probably a fairly common form of escape for many gay youth at least before the internet your recent work seems to be moving away from a portraiture style in which the dolls appear to be posing for the photograph and towards more candid action shots of multiple dolls often in military uniforms how has your approach towards using the dolls changed
6624079 now i still like the idea of the images from my mind but they are evolving not all the mental images are positive they dont all make clear statements they are in part about relationships with each other and with the world at large one of the veins is this body of work is to create images that are so strong that they make a permanent connection specifically right now i want to create a body of images that if not replace associate themselves with the american landscape one of the things that goes unnoticed is that most of the american landscape is heterosexual and white i will consider my series a success if you see one of the traditional american imagery and think of my dolls so the images in ruby green hint at this through the police military fireman imagery the flags and traditional alabama campus backdrop this is a deep rich vein that i feel i have barely scratched the surface
6624080 cool thanks john looking foward to seeing where these dolls travel next

6624151 from time to time rumors circulate that thimerosal a mercury based preservative once used in several vaccines and still used in some flu vaccine could contribute to asds however valid scientific studies have shown there is no link the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the cdc and the institute of medicine iom agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism
6624152 the author concludes that recent studies have found no association between mmr vaccination and autism the frequent embryologic neuroanatomic abnormalities found in children with autism lessen the likelihood that mmr immunization is a major risk factor the immunization safety review committee of the institute of medicine and a special american academy of pediatrics panel have concluded that evidence does not support mmr immunization as a risk factor for autism
6624153 on may 18th 2004 the institute of medicine iom released its eighth and final report from its immunization safety review committee based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological studies neither the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine are associated with autism says the new report furthermore the hypotheses regarding how the mmr vaccine and thimerosal could trigger autism lack supporting evidence and are theoretical only further research to find the cause of autism should be directed toward other lines of inquiry that are supported by current knowledge and evidence and offer more promise for providing an answer said the committee that wrote the report the american medical association ama lauds the process that went into the creation of this scientific report and applauds the iom and the cdc for their strong efforts in continuing to ensure the safety of the vaccines that are administered in the united states through post market surveillance and studies such as this
6624154 some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal from the addition of important new vaccines recommended for children explains the higher prevalence in recent years
6624155 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism

6624277 y tambi n porque he tenido una buena respuesta por mi aspiraci n a la gubernatura en sectores como la iniciativa privada acad micos j venes universitarios eso me hace sentir con mucho optimismo y al mismo tiempo con mucha tranquilad para planear mi estrategia pol tica y hacia la sociedad
6624278 que son los municipios que tienen el 80 por ciento de la poblaci n electoral del estado tengo buenas respuestas a mis planteamientos encuentro mucha solidaridad a mi aspiraci n por parte de los l deres y de gente muy importante
6624279 soy un cuadro que entiende la complejidad y lo competido de las pr ximas elecciones y s sin ret rica que mi partido necesita de unidad interna para conservar la gubernatura y las posiciones m s importantes
6624280 y esa situaci n me lleva a pensar que soy un cuadro que puede tener para mi partido mayor aceptaci n con grupos pol ticos y con amplios sectores de la sociedad civil y ah est basada una de mis fortalezas que le puedo dar al pri
6624281 la experiencia es una de mis fortalezas el militante de mi partido el observador ciudadano que analiza todos los cuadros ven en arnoldo ochoa un aspirante con experiencia para gobernar
6624282 y ah el nombre de arnoldo se escucha y se analiza en este tipo de perfil en muy diversos sectores desde analistas pol ticos acad micos y j venes identifican mi perfil como el de mayor experiencia pol tica y de alguien que sabe gobernar porque ya fui gobernador interino
6624283 el riesgo existe pero como en cualquier otro partido pol tico
6624284 habr de enfrentarlo con mucha madurez pol tica pero todo mundo conoce a arnoldo ochoa como un hombre institucional y le reconoce la actitud de inclusi n y buscar a trav s del di logo la unidad pol tica
6624285 y puedo decir con toda claridad de que a quien m s confianza le tienen los grupos son a los pol ticos serios e institucionales y ah vuelve a sonar el nombre de arnoldo ochoa
6624286 mi partido sabe que yo ser a un candidato del pri que basar a mi pol tica en la inclusi n y los acuerdos pol ticos y s cumplo y soy de palabra y puedo sostener acuerdos a corto y largo plazo
6624287 y lo que nos hace falta es consensuar gobierno e iniciativa privada un proyecto de desarrollo econ mico que nos permita generar fundamentalmente los empleos necesarios y de calidad que requiere la poblaci n
6624288 ah hay un riesgo yo veo focos que se prenden de manera preventiva en manzanillo donde se habla de levantones con amenazas de secuestro crece el narcomenudeo el robo de tr ilers pero tambi n se habla de robo hormiga en el puerto interior y son se ales muy importantes que debemos detectar y con base en la coordinaci n entre el municipio y el estado necesitamos atender y resolver esos focos que se prenden en amarillo para que colima siga siendo un estado seguro
6624289 esto es de estar actuando todos los d as capacitando mejor nuestros cuerpos de seguridad comprando tecnolog a y equipamiento de punta dando de baja a los polic as corruptos la seguridad debe ser algo que debemos de estar en coordinaci n con los tres niveles de gobierno y de planeaci n a corto mediano y largo plazo

6624292 estos aspectos son importantes para incentivar el desarrollo econ mico teniendo como eje el puerto de manzanillo
6624293 estos pa ses est n esperando que se generen industrias manufactureras de todos los productos que los asi ticos requieren y que necesitan de nuestro pa s el tema m s importante de la regasificadora es lograr equilibrar el desarrollo del puerto en lo comercial y tur stico con el medio ambiente
6624294 tenemos una gran infraestructura educativa que debemos fortalecer con incentivos fiscales en caso de la educaci n privada y fortalecer las instituciones educativas p blicas con mayores recursos para que haya menos j venes sin oportunidad de estudiar
6624295 no queremos que las instituciones expulsen centenas de j venes sino que egresen cuadros profesionistas con un buen perfil acad mico que sean debidamente reconocidos en el sector productivo
6624296 y de cumplirse el proyecto de la regasificadora colima tendr la oportunidad de un repunte en el sector tur stico y debemos prepararnos para encontrar con antelaci n los inversionistas que quieran venir a invertir en proyectos tur sticos e inmobiliarios
6624297 debemos prepararnos para un relanzamiento de la industria tur stica en dos vertientes los proyectos de gran turismo como tambi n una gran presencia en el turismo nacional como cuyutl n pascuales y el real que eran balnearios que ten an un gran atractivo para jalisco guanajuato y aguascalientes tenemos que recuperar nuestra presencia en el turismo de bajos ingresos as como en el de altos ingresos como los de texas arizona y nuevo le n debemos trabajar para recuperar esos nichos de mercado
6624298 el pr ximo a o trataremos de fortalecer el sector salud con un hospital de la mujer

6624378 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6624379 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6624380 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6624381 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6624424 sony ericsson is well known for its progressive design and high level of innovation therefore we felt that this would be a good match to the saab brand one of our main challenges was to make sure that we choose the ideal device and software to ensure the seamless integration with the car systems
6624425 it is a question of technology performance as well as experience in working with it we have already used symbian os technology in previous projects with positive results so it is a system we have confidence in bluetooth technology supplies a direct link between car and phone and is not dependent on network infrastructure or influenced by mobile network coverage limitations
6624426 similarly to the integration concept that we worked on with sony ericsson the saab 9 x biohybrid features additional conceptual innovations that you might see in future passenger cars for instance switching regular rear view mirrors for high resolution cameras although exterior mirrors are currently required by regulations the concept of using cameras instead of exterior mirrors on the 9 x biohybrid means you could use a phone application to remotely check if your car is safe and not being damaged or stolen

6624432 although uma based wi fi solutions have seen early gains in greenfield markets these solutions have not proliferated much outside their current carrier footprints this can be attributed partly to the carriers desire to assess femtocell developments but also to lingering concerns regarding the concept of wi fi based fixed mobile convergence

6624503 when the stock market is trending downward it is difficult to know what to do amid the uncertainty is the proven benefit of owning dividend paying stocks
6624504 sure the share prices of such stocks and equity etfs can fall but the dividend payments continue to generate income in both good and bad times
6624505 despite the current market gyrations one intriguing new etf that offers exposure to a growth oriented foreign market and dividend income is the
6624506 the new etf began trading on july 16 the fund is based on the performance of the wisdomtree middle east dividend index
6624507 gulf gives investors exposure to approximately 70 dividend paying companies listed in bahrain egypt jordan kuwait morocco oman qatar and the united arab emirates
6624508 if youre worried that oil prices will resume their upward trajectory after their recent pullback the countries featured in the gulf etf should benefit economically from such a trend
6624509 oil certainly is a key commodity for middle eastern countries and their economies but this fund is not dependent on the performance of just one sector
6624510 the funds second and third largest sector holdings are telecommunications services and industrials respectively telecom companies drew 24 56 of the funds assets as of july 29 while industrials took in 11 37
6624511 clearly this fund is diversified in ways that focus on the regions overall growth opportunities and the kinds of companies that will benefit from continued gross domestic product gdp gains
6624512 kuwait is the nation that has attracted the most investment dollars of gulf the fund has put 27 73 of its holdings into kuwaiti companies while the united arab emirates with 18 12 and egypt with 12 69 round out the top three countries where gulf has placed its investment funds
6624513 i am not recommending this new fund right now as it still is trying to build its trading volume to the threshold of 100 000 shares a day that i like to see before pursuing such an opportunity
6624514 you may want to hold off on investing in gulf until its trading volume increases and until we see its price performance for the first four to six weeks
6624515 still i think the idea of mining for dividends in the middle east is sound and i will definitely be keeping a close watch on gulf for all of us

6624529 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in the air crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6624530 philip her husband joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6624531 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6624532 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
6624533 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
6624534 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
6624535 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
6624536 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
6624537 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
6624538 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
6624539 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
6624540 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
6624541 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
6624542 a worldview based on the idea that important matters are esoteric in nature
6624543 if theres any day that a lot of people think christ might come its probably not going to be that day

6624553 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6624554 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6624555 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6624556 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6624557 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems
6624558 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6624559 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6624560 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6624561 sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile
6624562 while debris impact from the collapse of wtc 1 initiated fires in wtc 7 the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of wtc 7

6624594 in the autumn of 1969 the weatherman led by bernardine dohrn and mark rudd converged on chicago and planned a series of demonstrations to dramatize their beliefs
6624595 but ayers it is also true to say has since followed in the footsteps of the great chicago social worker jane addams crusading for education and juvenile justice reform his 1997 book a kind and just parent the children of juvenile court has been praised for exposing how cook countys juvenile justice system all but eliminates a childs chance for redemption is barack obama consorting with a radical hardly ayers is nothing more than an aging lefty with a foolish past who is doing good and while yes obama is friendly with ayers it appears to be only in the way of two community activists whose circles overlap obamas middle name is hussein that doesnt make him an islamic terrorist he stopped wearing a flag pin that doesnt make him unpatriotic and hes friendly with uic professor william ayers that doesnt make him a bomb thrower time to move on to phony flap 6 537 204
6624596 whatever his past ayers is now a respected member of the chicago intelligentsia and still a member of the woods fund board
6624597 ben says ayers and obama were at best casual friends even that seems to overstate things though i dont see evidence of any relationship the only concrete connection we know of is the meeting which was attended by a number of local liberals their contemporaneous membership on the board of a local organization and a 200 donation by ayers to one of obamas state senate campaigns obama also once praised something ayers had written about the juvenile justice system im not saying they couldnt have been casual friends just that there isnt much evidence for that at this point
6624598 those are pretty slender ties to a controversial figure the dean of baruch colleges school of public affairs david birdsell said of mr obamas links to mr ayers
6624599 i dont regret setting bombs bill ayers said i feel we didnt do enough mr ayers who spent the 1970s as a fugitive in the weather underground was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn of the 19th century stone house in the hyde park district of chicago
6624600 william ayers is a school reform activist distinguished professor of education and senior university scholar at the university of illinois at chicago where he teaches courses in interpretive research urban school change and youth and the modern predicament he is the founder of the center for youth and society and founder and co director of the small schools workshop a graduate of the bank street college of education and teachers college columbia university he has written extensively about social justice democracy and education his interests focus on the political and cultural contexts of schooling as well as the meaning and ethical purposes of teachers students and families
6624601 ayers is now mainstream an educator with distinguished professor status he has written three books about education and has advised chicago mayor richard m daley on the subject of school reform
6624602 william ayers is as sensitive and gifted a chronicler as he is a teacher
6624603 william ayers was a fugitive too for nine of those years but the federal charges against him miss dohrn and other members of the revolutionary organization were dropped in 1979 when it was ruled that the governments case was based on illegal wiretaps
6624604 william ayers surrendered and pleaded guilty in 1980 to possession of explosives and served no time teaches early childhood development at the university of illinois

6624644 there was a time when ex pats and wealthy locals in china living in the mainland bought foreign brands to avoid inferior products and dangerous unregulated food and medicine but now that practice has been flipped on its head the danger is climbing the value chain and reaching our shelves and our brands
6624645 these are items that children are supposed to be playing with
6624646 it should be at a point where companies in the united states that are importing these items are held liable
6624647 it is a big concern and the agency is taking steps to try to address that as quickly as possible
6624648 their businesses will suffer if they dont meet safety standards
6624649 they dont have the staff that they need to try to get ahead of this problem
6624650 do i have to look at every toy that has paint on it that comes from china as perhaps suspect
6624651 is there a concern that there are more products coming in from china and making sure they live up to the standards we expect
6624652 yes there is and we understand our authority and obligation and we will make sure we enforce it
6624653 we cant wait any longer for china to crack down on its lax safety standards this needs to stop now before more children and more families are put at risk
6624654 if they dont i believe congress must give federal regulators the authority to ensure that our kids toys wont actually harm them

6624670 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
6624671 as more and more of this material is being sold to china we wanted to know the impact that was having on the environment and specifically whether the co2 emissions from the transport outweighed the benefits of the recycling
6624672 although this study is only part of the environmental impact story it is clear that there are significant co2 savings that can be made by shipping our unwanted paper and plastic to china
6624673 in some cases we just arent able to reprocess everything we collect or there isnt enough of it to do so in these cases shipping it to china which has a high demand and need for material makes sense in co2 terms
6624674 more importantly this project will represent a new era for energy in oregon

6624704 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands odi squad after careful consideration
6624705 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6624706 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number of reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6624707 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the series against south africa
6624708 it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
6624709 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6624710 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming series then im happy to do just that
6624711 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6624712 we were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday
6624713 and i probably should have told you sooner i just didnt realize things with us would end up where they are

6624715 i got involved with this threesome a while back and well now she wants to leave her husband and well ive still been seeing her without him
6624716 well i cant say i ever really thought about it no
6624717 dont look at me like that im sorry im not going to stop seeing her though this is part of the reason why i told you i was so against being in a relationship with you with anyone
6624718 i dont know something anything just dont stare at me like im some kind of freak to you now
6624719 im thinking it will be hard to be with you now knowing that you might be thinking about her while youre with me

6624747 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6624748 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher

6625237 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
6625238 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
6625239 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
6625240 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
6625241 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
6625242 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
6625243 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
6625244 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
6625245 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
6625246 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
6625247 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
6625248 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
6625249 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
6625250 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
6625251 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
6625252 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
6625253 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
6625254 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
6625255 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
6625256 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
6625257 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
6625258 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
6625259 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
6625260 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
6625261 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
6625262 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
6625263 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
6625264 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
6625265 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
6625266 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
6625267 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
6625268 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
6625269 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
6625270 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
6625271 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
6625272 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
6625273 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
6625274 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
6625275 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
6625276 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
6625277 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
6625278 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
6625279 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
6625280 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
6625281 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
6625282 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

6625301 eating a small meal or snack every 3 to 4 hours actually helps maintain energy and blood sugar levels
6625302 snacks that have a lot of refined sugar like a candy bar get digested quickly so you get a surge of glucose but then its gone

6625319 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further

6625322 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6625323 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6625324 i want to say lets not judge him he is oviouslly not well but for a different reason we all have parayed for so why stop praying i tonight will pray for him to get help and i pray he will be forgiven
6625325 praying for mike and the people who are affected by this his friends family and countless others who trusted mike just remember that the word says in psalm 118 8 to trust in god and not man why because were all fallible no one is perfect im not making excuses for mike i dont know the man even if i did i dont truly know his heart the way god does none of us do but i do believe that we can exercise the same grace and mercy god shows us all the time despite our actions
6625326 so to me its a no brainer i would not be who i am today without mike and his family so even though i do not understand why or how this is possible and i may never get my answers i still pray for his family and him because i cannot imagine the pain confusion stress and humilitation they must all be suffering forgiveness is not about understanding why he has done this its much more if anyone knows this family and mike himself they will have no trouble forgiving and supporting because we all know what they would if it was reversed and we were in the wrong
6625327 i was under his teachings closely in the time he announced his sickness he talked alot about forgiveness not taking offence pride and giving everything to god and not battling in the flesh and things in the secret place being shouted from the roof im not a preacher or very good at putting my thoughts into words so i hope this comes out right but i think he was a man of god who was human like us and had one thing he struggled to deal with and battled it with his own strength but new what would be happening so prepared us by teaching us how to forgive and not be hurt

6625355 the main task as in all periods of the whole movement remains the solution of the jewish arab problem it is obvious that ultimately peace with our neighbors is required if the jewish state is to survive at present we are trying to achieve this peace by force and to build up in feverish haste the military strength which is to guarantee our security but under no conditions can force be enough

6625395 many pediatricians routinely include vision screenings as part of a regular physical
6625396 such screenings arent as thorough but theyre a cost effective way to sort the kids who might need a comprehensive exam from the overwhelming majority who dont
6625397 thats why groups including the american academy of pediatrics aap and the american academy of ophthalmology aao oppose mandatory eye exams for children
6625398 besides out of pocket costs well be paying for those exams in the form of higher premiums and more tax dollars to cover the costs for those who rely on the government for medical care
6625399 a 2004 study published in the journal of the american academy of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus concluded that mandatory eye exams can lead to wasteful overprescribing of glasses
6625400 educators arent thrilled about having to enforce yet another nanny state law
6625401 but schools still bear the administrative burden along with the thankless task of nagging noncompliant parents
6625402 whats coming into focus is an overreaching law that burdens parents and educators and drives up the cost of medical care there are no proven benefits and no consequences for those who blow it off
6625403 vision disorders are the most prevalent handicapping condition in childhood however fewer than 15 of all preschool children receive an eye examination
6625404 important vision disorders in children include amblyopia strabismus significant refractive error ocular disease and color vision deficits early detection and treatment of these disorders are important to maximize a childs visual potential
6625405 amblyopia is a significant public health problem with a prevalence in the neighborhood of 2 to 5 it is the leading cause of monocular blindness in the 20 70 year age group
6625406 early detection of amblyopia can occur if factors that cause amblyopia are detected and treated earlier possibly even before children become literate
6625407 visual development from birth through school age has sensitive and critical periods where abnormalities can lead to permanent impairments especially in the development of binocular vision an important part of human vision
6625408 impaired vision in children can seriously impede learning and contributes to the development of emotional and behavioral problems early discovery and treatment can prevent or at least alleviate many of these problems
6625409 screening is not determine that correction of a possible defect or need for glasses is indicated diagnoses are made only by an eye doctor
6625410 screening tests vary widely in performance even when administered by licensed eye care professionals the four best tests detected two thirds of children with one or more targeted conditions but nearly 90 of the children with the most severe conditions
6625411 vision screening is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by an eye doctor
6625412 children with impaired vision often are not aware of their handicap therefore they do not complain or seek help if they have always seen in a blurred or distorted way they accept the imperfect image without question for this reason it is up to the adults responsible for the childs health care and educational process to detect those children with vision problems
6625413 dua pria tampaknya telah meledakkan diri mereka di luar pabrik itu pada saat pergantian shift pembom itu berjalan kaki dan masing masing meledakkan diri berselang tidak sampai satu menit
6625414 pembom kami melakukan serangan hari ini ini jawaban atas operasi militer di swat dan bajaur

6625416 saya sedang bekerja di pabrik itu ketika saya mendengar satu ledakan dan kemudian ledakan lainnya ledakan itu sangat besar
6625417 orang orang keamanan kemudian dengan segera mengepung tempat itu dan kami tidak diperbolehkan keluar
6625418 in the absence of a complete eye test common pediatric vision problems may go undetected and limit a childs ability to learn and succeed and in some cases can be misdiagnosed as a learning disability or behavioral problem
6625419 a terrible public policy designed to break down referral sources
6625420 needlessly expensive optometric examinations for the effective screenings now done by primary care physicians
6625421 undead they act as if they must find a logical reason for movie plots as to why theyre wandering around
6625422 dont pray in our schools and we wont think in your church stupid freakin zombies
6625423 ooooh blaaargh blaaaaargh youre so intolerant to religion and you hate us blaaaargh

6625426 while were pointing out the obvious how about an obvious yet unasked question why werent explosives the first thing considered as the cause for the wtc buildings collapse
6625427 impaired vision in children can seriously impede learning and contributes to the development of emotional and behavioral problems nationally the percentage of eye defects among all school children is between 20 and 25 it is doubtful if any other handicapping condition so drastically affects such a large segment of the school population early discovery and treatment can prevent or at least alleviate many of these problems
6625428 will the vision first report be accepted by the state as proof of an eye exam
6625429 ok honey you can go home now we will take over from here
6625430 he may have had a hard time on the school exam screening
6625431 recommends screenings as a cost effective way to evaluate a childs vision
6625432 a screening is generally a routine check for eye alignment and strength
6625433 instead of saying that christians must accept the the lowest common denominator of morality as dobson accused obama of suggesting or that people of faith shouldnt advocate for the things their convictions suggest obama was saying the exact opposite that christians should offer their best moral compass to the nation but then have to engage in the kind of democratic dialogue that religious pluralism demands

6625492 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and
6625493 after we got to the take off zone the pilot apologised and said he would have to return because of a technical problem they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6625494 i heard a horrible noise as we were taking off the plane was rocking from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash the next thing i remember was being flung from the aircraft i dont know what happened next
6625495 i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6625496 i could hardly move when i lifted my head all i saw around me were scattered bodies i could feel the incredible heat from the wreckage when the wind changed i could hardly breathe i had to protect my face with my arm i heard people including children crying for help i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6625497 i took one of the children into the lorry and he thought he was in a film he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was true if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6625498 today is another birthday we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it to the departure gate
6625499 we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6625500 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there youre not going to believe it but we are going to fly again with spanair
6625501 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6625502 my mother called him and said that he should get off but my father said they would not let him
6625503 stare in front of the fridge without a clue as to what to eat
6625504 ive been listening to steves podcasts and following both the gillmor gang and newsgang live for some time now as it turns out steve and i think very much alike hes tireless and unrepentant when he locks on to an issue that he believes strongly in and thats just the kind of determination we need on the campaign trail and even more so after we win the election in november given the number of challenges ahead of us
6625505 once again track was down and i was unable to follow anything or anyone today on twitter or identi ca so i was late getting the news of course im surprised
6625506 like all of those thought to be in consideration steve was keeping a low profile in the run up to the announcement
6625507 this will sure keep steve out of trouble as for the rest of us im not so sure id like to see him call this clinton or mccain spin
6625508 im not sure how this will affect the us markets when they open tomorrow
6625509 im stunned i think we all are i would have never imagined this as a possibility to think that throughout the entire primary season and now the summer run up to the convention none of us had a clue that obama was paying attention to what we or more importantly steve was saying on the podcast
6625510 thats it im outta here and im voting for mccain
6625511 congratulations on your next step in life as you two life partners become one

6625513 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
6625514 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
6625515 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
6625516 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
6625517 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6625518 north carolina gotta love it i also love the notion acronym of ufc as in ultimate fighting magically also applying to ultimate faith it works on so many levels on the bottom you can barely see the horns but also in this plaza biker bar called the goat with menacing satan like goat mascot would love to see a face off between ufc church goers and goat hanger ons on sunday morning best strip mall ever

6625526 its been too hot to do anything except sit around and look at each other with three boys in the house that inevitably means that somehow somewhere somebodys getting drop kicked
6625527 we immediately notified local and federal law enforcement agencies and are looking to cooperate with them
6625528 ondanks al die jaren kan hataw nog steeds niet goed slapen ze heeft nog steeds de angst dat haar broer haar kan vinden
6625529 elke dag worden er meer en meer vrouwen gedood in koerdistan terwijl de autoriteit alleen kijkt en niets doet
6625530 het is de patriarchale maatschappij van koerdistan die het mogelijk maakt dat de mannen alles mogen controleren bijvoorbeeld de man mag bepalen met wie zijn zus of dochter trouwt
6625531 we hebben veel vrouwen beschermd van doodsbedreiging en veel arrestaties gepleegd
6625532 de wetten zijn ouderwets en er moeten nieuwe hervormingen komen om de huidige situatie te kunnen controleren
6625533 toen de vogelgriep uitbreek lanceerde de koerdische overheid een grondige campagne om mensen te waarschuwen over de gevolgen van de vogelgriep nu vragen we ons af waarom de overheid niet dezelfde campagne lanceerde om een einde maken aan de moord op vrouwen
6625534 zij mag zelfs sjouwen in een haven als zij dit wil maar wel zolang andere sjouwers en mensen die kratten afleveren en ophalen ook vrouwen zijn zo is het met alle beroepen zowel van werk in een ziekenhuis tot een kantoorbaan
6625535 dat betekend dat een vrouw nergens kan werken want overal zijn mannen daar ontkom je echt niet aan
6625536 en wat vindt u dan van hoe het er hier aan toe gaat
6625537 jullie vrouwen zitten vastgebonden aan werk en uitbuiting ik snap niet hoe jullie je nog voort kunnen planten als je meer tijd aan werk dan aan kinderen besteed bovendien krijgen jullie maar gemiddeld drie kinderen
6625538 jullie gaan trouwens ook te vrij om met mannen dat is slecht jullie kunnen mannen zo een reden geven om slecht te doen
6625539 het is alleen maar gezond zo met elkaar om te gaan onze mannen draaien ten minste niet door vanwege haar of een stukje blote huid
6625540 waarom mogen wij vrouwen niet met mannen omgaan en moeten we ons in een tent hullen
6625541 je zou het misschien niet denken maar vrouwen hebben ook hersens wij weten voor onszelf echt wel wat goed en slecht is
6625542 wat vindt u eigenlijk van het feit dat wij nu met elkaar staan te praten man en vrouw angstvallig dicht bij elkaar en ik een vrouw huid en haren onbedekt schrikt het u af
6625543 het schrikt me niet af maar het doet me ook geen deugt je speelt met je toekomst en je plaats in de hemel het doet me verdriet te zien dat je niet het juiste pad volgt

6625552 dat is de kleine jihad wij moslims worden opgeroepen een heilige oorlog te voeren we verdedigen ons geloof met wapens allah zegene ons zouden jullie christenen ook moeten hebben
6625553 beste jongen daar kan ik nog niks van vinden ik heb het immers nog niet gezien
6625554 hoe kunt u dat nou zeggen die moslims moeten maar wennen aan kritiek de wereld is niet alleen van hun hoor
6625555 kind zie je dan niet waar zon film toe zou kunnen leiden aanslagen doden
6625556 aanslagen om een film dat is toch ronduit bespottelijk als wij een aanvaring hebben met belgi of zo om maar iets te noemen dan gaan we daar toch ook geen aanslagen plegen
6625557 cultuur cultuur dat is geen cultuur mevrouw dat is belachelijk achterlijk achtergebleven barbaars gedrag
6625558 wij moeten dus wel alles accepteren van hun dat zij onze vlaggen verbranden ons heilig boek vervloeken en in de fik steken dat ze ons bedreigen vervloeken ontvoeren en vermoorden dat ze een filmpje maken hoe ze geert wilders de hals door snijden dat moeten we allemaal maar over ons heen laten komen maar zelf mogen we geen relatief onschuldige film over de islam maken omdat zij zich dan beledigd voelen dat is toch belachelijk

6625569 regarding the timing why 12 there are a lot of reasons we spent some time playing with different numbers timing ten seconds is actually a little too short oftentimes we saw people needing a second or two to mentally prepare or not realizing that recording had started 15 seconds is a little too long lots of testers said they were getting bored and twelve is kind of like us a little different we march to our own crazy drummers and we liked twelve it felt distinctive and its fun
6625570 we have many partnership discussions ongoing with a wide variety of different companies and services our goal is to be the platform for video status and any service that might benefit from a short form video status update mechanism is a service were interested in working with and supporting

6625573 theres ups and downs when they go through that process today was a good day some days are not as good
6625574 miguel was communicating that injuries to us probably earlier and more clearly than erik erik basically after five innings in that july 4 game said im done my arm is hanging a little bit
6625575 that bedards injury probably had been going on for a couple months but it seems like miguel wasnt right from spring training it wasnt stopping him from pitching but he was never himself we were in tune to that he brought it to our attention early on and tried to pitch through it
6625576 i hate to use that word too much frustrating its a word that been surrounding us so much of the year
6625577 you feel bad for him the guy pitched through a lot of pain early and because he doesnt talk to you guys reporters he was never able to get that message out there
6625578 theres a perception that he wasnt pitching as much as he should but it was just the opposite he was probably pitching more than he should have so im not disappointed or frustrated with anything i just look forward to the time when we can get him healthy
6625579 i dont know how much pain there is in there how hes feeling
6625580 i think eriks the only one to answer it but unfortunately hes not talking
6625581 the problem with this is that immediately upon the finish of the race the rest of the racers still had 20 meters to go

6625617 we are talking about the size of land equivalent to darwins northern suburbs zoned for development so there is what we call inland areas within that broader development footprint that could indeed be relevant to be downstream gas based industries such as the dow chemicals
6625618 it has rail it has roads it is certainly not ad hoc it is zoning that has been in place for decades it infrastructure that has been rolling into there for decades so it is hardly ad hoc
6625619 so i guess im going to make the liberalss dream come true they want me to stay on and i will stay on and i will stay on for another term

6625737 to please god to be a real ingredient in the divine happiness to be loved by god not merely pitied but delighted in as an artist delights in his work or a father in a son it seems impossible a weight or burden of glory which our thoughts can hardly sustain

6625818 harper again serves as bushs mouthpiece in canada while eastern canada suffers unseasonable rains the west enjoys its average warm hot summer in the middle east however the heat is rising in the geo political field i noticed an article in the local paper the province friday august 15 p a41 concerning prime minister harper and his claim that russia is returning to a soviet era mentality that may well be true but it is only because the americans adopted their own unilateral interventionist first strike supreme military full spectrum dominance ethos that has proven so disastrous around the world but specifically in military terms in the middle east

6625822 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
6625823 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6625824 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6625825 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6625826 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6625827 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6625828 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6625829 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6625830 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6625831 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6625832 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins

6625835 nobody has the eagles or the buffaloes right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
6625836 how did this happen what are we supposed to think and feel about this where do we go from here

6625839 on vacation ive had the opportunity to indulge my politics obsession with some daily poolside talk radio both conservative and liberal lets get right to the point liberal radio is a disaster its un listenable while the right wingers are out there relentlessly bashing the hell out of sen barack obama and the democratic party in an effort to tear him and it down in their quest for the presidency our compadres on the left are indulging themselves in sophomoric humor and inane blabbering about nothing in particular all you need is a 30 second listen and youll realize just how dreadful and unfocused it is with the exception of a few ass kickers like ed schultz lionel rachel maddow stephanie miller and randi rhodes the whole lot should be rounded up and shipped to an ashram somewhere and heres the other thng about dems thats infuriating they finally get a true warrior like rhodes but in their spineless quest for political correctness they eat their own and can her over some stupid remark during an off air comedy performance in all his years of outrageously offensive on air drivel has the right even punished let alone fired the bloviating rush limbaugh no they throw him crackers and send him in to do more damage

6625844 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6625845 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6625846 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6625847 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6625848 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6625849 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6625850 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6625851 cash flow is a better measure of the discretionary resources available to firms than profits
6625852 but while prices profits and cash flow have risen dramatically investment in exploration has not especially by the largest iocs
6625853 development expenditures reflect investments in fields that have already been discovered and are the easiest most cost effective way to boost output in the short run nonetheless it is investment in the exploration of new fields that will assure the long term viability of these firms
6625854 share buybacks equity repurchases have absorbed a growing share of these outlays rising from only 1 in 1993 to 37 1 in 006 while expenditures on exploration account for a decreasing proportion declining from 13 8 in 1993 to only 5 8 in 006 it is interesting to note that despite an almost 50 increase in exploration expenditures from 006 these expenditures as a share of the total increased from 5 3 to only 5 8
6625855 smaller firms are more aggressive in spending for reserves additions than the big five through growing exploration outlays and through acquisitions from other firms
6625856 the big five are gradually depleting their reserves with an average replacement ratio of only 8
6625857 to some extent the decline for the big five is attributable to the downward restatement of reserves especially by royal dutch shell
6625858 the oil production of the five largest oil companies has declined since the mid 1990s oil production for the five largest oil companies fell from 10 5 million b d in 1996 to 9 45 million b d in 2 005 before rebounding to 9 7 million b d in
6625859 increasingly the iocs have become more like general contractors coordinating the operation of a number of suppliers who themselves are the ones who undertake seismic work analyze data provide drilling rigs and crews and a host of oil field services the larger iocs also serve the function of bankers providing the vast amount of financial resources required to projects in increasingly unfavorable and difficult environments they also provide the management organizational skills and oversight that these large projects require

6625883 i think there are a lot of people out there in the industry who want to know that the government has handled it in the correct way

6625891 lord if you have to put this on me so this person can be free then let it be my heart is broken and i cannot handle seeing them live this way any longer
6625892 the language of primary speech is often the language of grace especially when its subject matter is the answer to prayer the reply to our beseechings on those occasions is a flow of gifts rarely clear as to source and not often a clear and direct response to what we have asked for that is to say if we have petitioned for a specific amount of money or support of some precise kind for a particular purpose in business or love or schoolwork we do not often get the exact sum in dollars and cents the precise favor at work the grade on a school assignment or the detailed show of affection we have requested god is not a banker of credit manager a personnel officer or intermediary in the offices of love the graces that come in answer to prayer come as we have indicated in the form of new energies freshly stimulated memories openings of self and the world agreeable changes in what we thought was our disagreeably fixed nature we may indeed receive funds sometimes much more sometimes much less than we asked for new jobs for old promotions splendid grades an overwhelming gathering up in love but prayer is not a cash business it is the world of grace which is to say its language is the language of the spirit and its specifications are very different from what we are accustomed to snip answers to our prayers are always wholenesses though we may choose out of the eagerness of our hopes or the stress of our needs to see or hear only those parts of the answers that speak directly to what we have been asked for in that way we may get our money our grade our job our gesture of love but we have missed something maybe what matters most if we have contented ourselves with the obvious answer to the prayer we may feel somewhere the increase of energy or the jog to our memory but not associate it with our prayer we may know in some way that we are not such an emotional simpleton or hoarder of anxieties as we were before but again not make the connection to our prayers

6625908 as an american i do not feel that the israelis are obligated or required to give up land in order to bring peace
6625909 you do not achieve peace by creating a situation where you cannot defend your borders and therefore protect your citizens having a temporary cessation of hostility is not peace if while that cessation of hostility is going on just across the border arms are being built up for the purpose of eventually pushing that border down

6626193 in the train however fast it travelled the passengers were compulsorily at rest useless between the walls of glass to feel emotion useless to try to follow any activity except of the mind and that activity could be followed without fear of interruption but in the rushing reverberating express noise was so regular that it was the equivalent of silence movement was so continuous that after a while the mind accepted it as stillness

6626203 utsume was extremely strange he never wore anything but black he rejected society you could call him handsome but the coldness in his gaze destroyed the effect he was very intelligent however his knowledge base leaned heavily toward matters of the occult witch trials abnormal psychology dark subjects because of this shortly after he met takemi and the other members of the literature club he was given the nickname dark prince takemi was of the opinion that it was impossible to come up with a better nickname for utsume when utsume stood up to explain his radical theories in extremely decisive tones he looked for all the world like a demonic overlord standing before his armies of darkness and declaring humanitys downfall nobody remembered clearly who had given him the name it may well have been takemi takemi so he had great admiration for those who were naturally gifted which had grown into a love of eccentrics takemi firmly believed that true genius made people extremely weird it was fun watching eccentrics especially those with the talent to back it up eccentrics easily could do things normal people would never think to do or wouldnt do even if the idea occurred to them takemi envied that and he took pleasure in watching it happen eccentrics words and actions spit in the face of common sense hearing and seeing this was takemis greatest joy for him being around people like that was more fun than anything else in life in that sense to takemi utsume was on a par with a really large theme park only utsume generated far more anecdotes

6626235 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
6626236 the loss just hurts too much in the present moment
6626237 id take away two pitches if i could the double and the home run
6626238 i felt like that third run kind of took a little bit out of us

6626241 it doesnt matter who they put in front of me im going to go out there to try to make him get better hes going to try to make me get better
6626242 right now its just the beginning of us gelling together as a team and thats our whole motto push each other
6626243 i just make sure during the week i prepare as hard as i can mentally and physically so when it comes to game time i dont have to worry about anything
6626244 every day you come out here and get to face these guys it starts to slow down a little bit
6626245 ive still got a lot of work to do and a lot of things to accomplish but its starting to slow down
6626246 we have already taken into consideration the utilization of venues after the games
6626247 id been in touch with him twice every three weeks for almost a year before he died july 30 2007
6626248 i still have the last message he left me on my phone before he died bill was instrumental in so many ways to me not just to how i developed as a coach and as a player he was one of the people that i leaned on
6626249 after that my voice wasnt projecting enough to overcome 70 000 screaming nfl fans and cbs was unbelievably good to me
6626250 they tried every way to keep me on board but my voice just wouldnt hold up
6626251 he asked me to make sure none of his quarterbacks made the same mistakes i made when i played
6626252 i get to call the plays i get to do all the fun stuff i told them i didnt want the title of offensive coordinator i wanted to be offensive assistant that way they dont know who to aim their sniper shots at we run the no huddle offense just like we did in cincinnati we run a quick snap offense where you may be in a huddle but youre out of it so fast you dont give the defense time to recover
6626253 some of the parents are complaining about that being too much every so often every few days actually youll see a player look up after he made a block or executed a play and hell look back at you as if to say this time yesterday i didnt think i could do that and thats just beautiful
6626254 sometimes it will be refreshing and sometimes it will be whoops i shouldnt have said that
6626255 sometimes the best most innovative thing is stay the course but if you dont go ahead when you know something needs to be done and just do it do it right and do it to its completion youre just not being a very good public servant unfortunately we have too much of that people worrying too much about being re elected rather than representing the people
6626256 some of it is petty some of it is inevitable attacks by people who have strong emotional ties to your opponent
6626257 my opponent was born and raised here and has a large family and has an extended family some of it is like signs getting stolen and getting run over by pickups and flattened out the rumor was spread around that i was the man from atlanta where he grew up like thats where the boogey people live and they come to eat pickens people we were married here my wife is born and raised here we lived here when we first got married the first chance we could after my job allowed me to live where we wanted to live we moved to pickens so i thought id been pretty loyal
6626258 hes always been in charge and hes going to find out hes going to butt heads with the chairman we have now plus in pickens county hell have 13 000 boss men the people who elected him he never lied to the people because he never promised them anything he just came in as sam wyche and talked about football people forget that o j simpson played football too
6626259 theres nothing in our community that is available for our kids
6626260 the baseball field is located where there was a segregated elementary school destroyed by fire for him to come back to a small town and help like this its almost unheard of
6626261 the only negative i see is he can be such a driving force that it might rub the old boy network the wrong way pickens is 3 000 strong if something happens on the west side in the morning youll hear about it on the east side by the afternoon
6626262 my efforts are going to be made toward bringing some of that business to pickens county pickens along with many cities in the southeast lost a lot of jobs to the textile industry going overseas or outsourcing theres room here to grow the labor force is here the labor force unfortunately looks around and if they dont have a job they go where the jobs are
6626263 this is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody
6626264 we had a player who had a tough situation at home and needed a place to stay
6626265 it apart of the college experience you have to do it
6626266 why did they include our two municipalities because we are muslim mayors maybe they thought that because we are muslims we will agree to the bad things that theyre doing there mindanao
6626267 i myself is fighting for the rights of the people of bataraza who are opposed to the bje in my opinion theres nothing good that will happen to us if the government allows our inclusion to the bangsamoro land
6626268 we believe that peace is for all of us for all palawe os however peace is not going to happen if they do it behind our backs like traitors if theres a peace agreement it must go through the process of consultation the people of palawan must know

6626280 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
6626281 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
6626282 their families are victims of americas right wing military incursions too mccain wants to continue with the idea of war for profit the americans are over that thinking now they have drugged our troops and lower classes into supporting their oil business atrocities for long enough we want to save not lose our souls thank you now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death ps it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support a brown man for the leader of the free world

6626293 make your attitude that of christ jesus who though existing in the form of god did not consider equality with god as something to be use for his own advantage instead he emptied himself by assuming the form of a slave talking on the likeness of men and when he had come as a man in his external form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even to death on a cross for this reason god also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father

6626304 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6626305 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6626306 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6626307 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6626308 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now

6626322 it became evident starting in denver july 11 13 that the mail from home program was really gaining a lot of momentum
6626323 and in brainerd aug 8 10 a new record of 1800 cards collected in one day was set with an overall record of over 5000 cards for the weekend
6626324 i made the decision then that we would have a car at the u s nationals dedicated to the troops who receive the mail and on the car is a picture of a soldier reading his mail in the war zone
6626325 our goal is to keep the momentum going and exceed the 90 000 number of cards we delivered to the troops in 2007 we project that mts will deliver over 100 000 cards by the end of 2008
6626326 is the result of the dedication of the 1100 plus employees of mail terminal services in supporting our partners at dhl global mail the united states postal service and all of their customers at home and overseas
6626327 weve enjoyed tremendous racing success through our technical partnership with all of the don schumacher racing teams including wins by the valvoline mts funny car
6626328 were proud to further support the mts at the track correspondence campaign and our troops abroad with a special paint scheme on jack beckmans funny car during the u s nationals
6626329 we at don schumacher racing are privileged to be a part of this wonderful program that mail terminal services has introduced to our team and nhra
6626330 we heartily support mtss efforts in this extremely rewarding endeavor

6626335 i really wish i could but i have church in the morning
6626336 i had a long night last night didnt get much sleep and im still a little sore
6626337 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6626338 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6626339 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6626340 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6626341 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6626342 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6626343 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6626344 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6626345 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6626346 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6626347 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6626348 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6626349 kalo kita seneng banget ntr pasti abis itu ada rasanya kita yg sedih banget
6626350 many organizations are looking for their hr leader to be able to understand in great detail the business and the challenges of the business
6626351 i really dont have time to learn about income statements and balance sheets im not accountable for the financial side of the business
6626352 we have decided to shelve this project for a year or more because we are really busy right now
6626353 we have cut our training budget what is the one employee training program you recommend
6626354 why do some people reach their creative potential in business while other equally talented people do not
6626355 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6626356 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6626357 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6626358 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6626359 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6626360 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6626361 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6626362 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6626363 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6626364 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6626365 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year
6626366 its only going to be a short amount of time before a new budget gets through and the congress is committed to moving peace corps in an upward direction
6626367 it is my goal to see a growing number of highly qualified diverse and determined americans of all ages committing themselves to serve our country as peace corps volunteers
6626368 achieving this goal will require a strong nationwide recruiting presence
6626369 hija disculpame se me olvid el cumplea os al que ivas
6626370 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6626371 comprehensive film tv and music download service at a later date
6626372 its like cooking paella it takes long to cook because it needs a lot of ingredients so we can talk about how to cook it and we can already buy the ingredients
6626373 but it should only be served after 7 p m which is dinner time
6626374 hr cant be expected to go it alone when it comes to talent management but it is more than capable of taking the wheel and guiding the ship
6626375 are you realistic about the contributions your favorite employees make or is blind love keeping you from letting a poor performer go
6626376 relics of the way things have always been done around here
6626377 i dont follow i am on board this change is my idea
6626378 will you terminate employment of the people who resist the change effort
6626379 people dont fall in love with institutions your chance of landing in a great relationship increases exponentially when you show a human side
6626380 we are looking to hire someone at a very senior level who will have full control over branding demand generation and all the elements of a sound marketing strategy
6626381 we have feelers out in the industry and out in the broader software and services industry as well
6626382 were most likely going to be hiring someone with strong software and service experience but perhaps from a different field than e mail marketing

6626428 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6626429 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6626430 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6626431 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human
6626432 i only have one favor to ask everyone who comes here
6626433 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger

6626435 this is for the heroes killed on their own land by the bloody aggressors
6626436 our battle for independence comes to its logical end before we thought we might have peaceful negotiation with the regime of georgia after aug 8 it was clear this was impossible

6626440 any attempt to try and bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge because of the international pressure can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings and to violence
6626441 theres absolutely no chance of reaching an agreement on anything by the end of the year
6626442 usually im not prophetic but theres no government on either side that can make any decisions on behalf of anyone
6626443 israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is to be the homeland for the palestinians
6626444 what the palestinians call the right of return is not an option without this understanding there is no agreement

6626466 it is my goal to see a growing number of highly qualified diverse and determined americans of all ages committing themselves to serve our country as peace corps volunteers
6626467 achieving this goal will require a strong nationwide recruiting presence

6626473 right now the country is rich and people are strong and we chinese are really standing up
6626474 twenty years ago no matter where we chinese stood people looked down on us but now no one dares to invade us anymore
6626475 everyone is crying out go china i feel the park is going to explode

6626509 there is no definitive link between the outbreak and the product at this time
6626510 our investigation includes a lot of sampling and of course with regard to sampling and testing that takes time
6626511 its a possibility their illness was caused by that but they also ate other high risk foods for listeria
6626512 so its going to be difficult to ever prove it without a doubt
6626513 the cause of death was not deemed to be listeria
6626514 frankly i think were surprised equally so that this has happened and im not sure blame can be placed on anybody for this situation but i do want to reiterate that sanitation is held to the highest standards

6626528 at a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges we need to find ways to feed an ever increasing global population
6626529 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
6626530 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
6626531 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
6626532 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
6626533 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

6626539 the legislature was right to approve banning employment discrimination of medical marijuana patients marijuana is safer than many prescription drugs that workers are allowed to use and urine testing has never been fda tested as either safe or effective in improving workplace safety and productivity
6626540 if police expect the taxpayers to cover their 1 2 million in overtime during the democratic national convention it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers
6626541 we hope police will not defy the people of this city or its mayor when the international spotlight hits the mile high city next week
6626542 there will be plenty for police to do during the dnc aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol

6626555 one way of boosting recycling might be to offer top recyclers smaller bins to demonstrate they have reduced their waste it gives people an aspiration to throw less away

6626685 the agency has determined that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment
6626686 it is unbelievable that the fdas first action on this issue is to turn to irradiation rather than focus on how to prevent contamination of these crops
6626687 instead of beefing up its capacity to inspect food facilities or test food for contamination all the fda has to offer consumers is an impractical ineffective and very expensive gimmick like irradiation
6626688 i think that from a growers perspective we have to consider anything that helps us provide safety for consumers but whether this takes off depends on consumers
6626689 in any marketing decision we have to look at cost in adapting the technology and consumer acceptance
6626690 its not something we have talked about in the year and a half we have had the marketing agreement in place
6626691 i do not know anyone clamoring for it there has to be consumer acceptance we do not know how big a hurdle that might be the science needs to be looked at and the cost too
6626692 its more of a safety net no matter how good a job you do with preventative steps good practices proper sanitation there is still a small chance for contamination this takes care of those small chances
6626693 and those products are ripe for using some kill step like irradiation to make it safer

6626702 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6626703 this type of alleged incident would never be tolerated by this administration and particularly by me
6626704 if the person is caught we will take quick and very stern action
6626705 if our co workers feel that way its just unacceptable what are we going to see next when we go into work a noose hanging from the ceiling
6626706 im not sure the intent behind it but the fact that people didnt seem to think it was a big deal bothers me
6626707 this is a stupid racial statement that was uncalled for and unacceptable
6626708 were going to continue this fight everyone is going to
6626709 we have come up with absolutely nobody that would admit to having done this but i hope the investigation serves as a wake up call to those who think things like this will be tolerated
6626710 this is a whole group situation that basically shows that its not just us

6626729 we are just glad to be able to help and let the ia take the lead with the combined medical engagement
6626730 hopefully every clinic in thawra 1 will get repeated visits from the ia as they are operating with more independence every day
6626731 we are grateful for the efforts of the ia and friendly forces the supplies they have brought will be put to good use of the people of our neighborhood
6626732 any patient that comes here is treated for free and these medical supplies and support from the ia greatly helps the people who rely on us
6626733 its the first time weve scrubbed in with any iraqis
6626734 anything we do to help build their medical capacity is a good use of our time and facilities
6626735 after reviewing all the data and evidence from photos video in cockpit cam and gps mapping we believe that we were in our lane we want everyone to know we would never make a move to blow someone over
6626736 the transition had been tremendously smooth and its clear that were passing an enormous milestone towards reaching uss george washingtons ultimate forward deployment assignment to the western pacific and indian oceans

6626738 your role as a chief petty officer needs to be crystal clear
6626739 never put aside your responsibilities as a chief and always maintain focus on defining yourself as a distinguished chief petty officer
6626740 i am proud to have been selected to an elite group of sailors
6626741 mcpons visit to the selectees was informational and motivating he let us now what the chiefs mess expects of us as well as those sailors who will be working under our guidance and mentorship
6626742 having a deep understanding and respect for the history of the chief petty officers mess will undoubtedly contribute to a chiefs ability to lead
6626743 those possessing that knowledge will certainly set themselves apart and succeed as leaders and teachers
6626744 whether a selectee has 10 years in the navy or 19 years in the navy the expectation we have of them is the same the same level of excitement the same level of willingness to take on responsibility so when i see that that tells me that the desire to be a chief is still strong and that our sailors aspire to that its really good to see
6626745 it was a good platform for future operations if we do this again wed love to come to howard
6626746 on behalf of the captain and crew of uss howard it was a pleasure to have you on board and we look forward to operating with you again
6626747 it was a great reflection on what america and working together is all about
6626748 im glad i was able to come out here today
6626749 i wish we could do more but i think even this little bit that we do here will go a long way
6626750 we are here in puerto cabezas to make a difference in young lives
6626751 this will be a life changing experience for those involved and a small miracle for the patients this mission is truly a rewarding experience
6626752 we screen the children to ensure they are healthy enough to undergo surgery
6626753 its not much but it is a place where they may feel safe
6626754 i recall the organizations first mission in haiti we were scheduled to have 60 surgeries but we accomplished 90 it was amazing and now we are here for the people of nicaragua

6626758 overall i think it was a great experience and gave me a chance to see another side of korea
6626759 the u s sailors are like aunts and uncles to these children
6626760 in addition to helping teach english the sailors are able help accomplish major tasks in a very short time tasks that would normally take a very long time
6626761 what blessed me most about this comrel community relations event is we went there expecting to help and bless them but the end result was we were blessed more than we blessed them
6626762 this deployment has given us the chance to develop interoperability between the u s and italian navies
6626763 weve been able to test our new systems in a different environment from which we normally operate mediterranean sea
6626764 the security cooperation partnerships we seek to build require connectivity interoperability and a baseline for communicating mutual understanding
6626765 exercising together is the key to significantly broader mutual cooperation with our partner nations
6626766 this is a great opportunity for my crew to interact with sailors from a different navy
6626767 well be able to share sea stories and see how different or similar our navies are
6626768 i never thought in a million years i would return home and get the opportunity to help out
6626769 with the help of my chain of command i got a surprise visit from my mother too
6626770 it was a tremendously overwhelming feeling to see mendoza with his mother
6626771 it was a wonderful opportunity for mendoza he is everything you could want in an airman he gives us his all everyday and it was the least we could do
6626772 this turned a short trip to nicaragua into a once in a lifetime opportunity for mendoza
6626773 this is yet another success for continuing promise 2008 we have reunited a family

6626778 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6626779 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6626780 that information is totally false there is a healthy advance for the show and there is no chance of the run being shortened
6626781 i dont have to return to california until next month for my next round of treatments right now im taking the medication as i am scheduled to take it
6626782 we have been walking our dogs and enjoying some of the restaurants
6626783 also we stay in the hotel so i can rest for filming

6626796 i think theres going to be a groundswell of support for mccain
6626797 i think a lot of hillary supporters are going to be for mccain
6626798 currently we have over 1 000 volunteers many of which are independent republicans and former clinton supporters and volunteers we expect to sign up hundreds more in the coming weeks we have three offices open in the region and we are opening two more shortly
6626799 i dont know im not sure im trying to get as much information as i can on both of them
6626800 i would have loved to see her as president we still have a week to go you never know whats going to happen at the convention i think she would be a fantastic choice for vice president
6626801 no it definitely does not the reason he was there was because he and jamie are very good friends
6626802 you can pick you friends but you cant pick your family
6626803 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
6626804 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6626805 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6626806 you know hes got a longer track record than that
6626807 at least senator mccain is being honest a vote for him is a vote for the draft period unless senator mccain radically changes his worldview there would be a draft to implement his plans
6626808 when you take into account his indefinite military commitment to iraq his desire to send more troops to afghanistan record lows in recruiting and retention and possibly more wars he is looking to get into like
6626809 wow other kids love this guy maybe ill let him pop my cherry
6626810 i think it is pretty impressive interesting and a quite different track than we are used to having on the calendar
6626811 you can have maybe some corners which seem to be like monaco but some very different corners very long straights which even can be similar to bahrain for example i think it is very nice it will be very very dirty tomorrow because you can see that the asphalt is very very slippery and dirty but i think it will be ok i think it will be nice i like the city so hopefully we can have a nice race for us but also for the people
6626812 for sure we need to look forward and we need to look to the next seven races we know we still have 70 points in front of us and we need to do our best to recover for sure if you look back it would have been a great moment to win the last race but sometimes this sport is like that the most important thing is that we are very competitive as i mentioned before even with the qualifying i would have been able to fight for the pole because the car was great i didnt do a good lap which is why i was not able to fight for the pole but in the race we showed our performance we showed great performance good speed good pace we showed that we are there which is the most important thing
6626813 it was a manufacturing problem of the piece and you cannot do anything we have never had this problem except at that particular moment so theres nothing that can be done about that
6626814 the championship will be decided by the points lost as much as the points gained
6626815 this has been the key since the first race it seems to be that all of us in the title fight have lost important points this year i think the key will be to be consistent over the seven races
6626816 i found this great image hosting website called xxxxxxxx com that i really like you can upload photos share them with friends and edit images if you need to upload images quickly or you need to edit images such as add text create slideshows etc then you should really visit xxxxxxx i think you will enjoy this site very much because its just what you need so visit www xxxxxx com now

6626860 we are conservatives they are liberals their policies fail and our policies work choose
6626861 go a little deeper addressing the need to be relevant to culture and to contexualize their ministry to todays world
6626862 most were preoccupied with other matters arguments about religious esoterica fights over arcane biblical interpretations fanciful escapes into theological speculation heat and fury over drinking or gambling or playing cards or using tobacco controversies over whether guitars and drums can be used in worship gatherings or whether only pianos and organs produce holy music and other matters that in comparison to racism genocide carelessness toward the poor and various minorities exploitation of the environment and unjust war seem shamefully trivial weapons of mass destruction
6626863 our nationwide policy of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy was neither voted for by our people nor enacted by our legislators not a single state had such unrestricted abortion before the supreme court decreed it to be national policy in 1973
6626864 more than 15 million have had their lives snuffed out by legalized abortions
6626865 over ten times the number of americans lost in all our nations wars
6626866 our nation wide policy of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy was neither voted for by our people nor enacted by our legislators not a single state had such unrestricted abortion before the supreme court decreed it to be national policy in 1973 make no mistake abortion on demand is not a right granted by the constitution
6626867 no liberal cause is defended with more dishonesty than abortion
6626868 there is a sense in places like san francisco that the united states consists of a narrow sliver on the east coast and the narrow sliver on the west coast and the rest of the country is uninteresting and unimportant and that kind of attitude was evidenced in senator obamas comments

6626880 as our nation expands west into new territories if those states are slave states slaves will take many of the labor opportunities we anticipate and would like for ourselves therefore we should limit slavery not because blacks are equal human beings they are not nor should we limit it because we find it a deplorable institution we should limit slavery because they will be competition for our labor

6626916 given that the chinese government has lied through its teeth
6626917 the western media was clamoring for a comment the people who could comment were out of town their instinct was that you had to get everybody together to analyze what had happened
6626918 i think the chinese learned a lot from experiences like spielberg about how fast the news cycle is

6626940 what is the major difference from an astrological gemstones and the others that we get in big malls or jewelers
6626941 ive personally picked up houses that were facing foreclosure for 60 000 with a short sale then i was able to turn around and sell it for as much as 80 000 just a few weeks later thats 20 000 of profit for just five to seven hours of work
6626942 youve got to have a proven system and do it right to get those kind of results the fact is there have been a lot of people entering the foreclosure market without the right plan and they got burned weve made our share of mistakes along the way and we want to help people avoid making these same costly errors the foreclosure epidemic is a great opportunity for those who are properly informed
6626943 it will just be too unsafe to have equipment and activity in there
6626944 i think its good for the city but probably too little too late
6626945 im sure the neighbors are happy to see it done only problem is why so late
6626946 well i think it should have been done ten or twelve years ago but im glad to see its finally being done
6626947 if god is light i want to be like him
6626948 the works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind for only great poets can read them they have only been read as the multitude read the stars at most astrologically not astronomically
6626949 confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me
6626950 should hope that some more recent lyrical soul maybe more perhaps standing on the shoulders of this imposing fellow but with maybe a sweeter sense of audience than he had has written striking and uniquely mormon verse to satify those who hunger and thirst after it
6626951 this is as good as it get folks what did you expect dante maybe youve read orson whitneys home literature one too many times
6626952 i tell you not to write long sentences in your verse i tell you again not to do it unless you can do it like this
6626953 layers and layers of meaning and reference for sparse elegance ill stick to well carfted appellate briefs
6626954 is it really possible to have too much sparse elegance
6626955 all truth is independent in that sphere in which it is placed
6626956 but i havent been trained in how to make those sorts of discriminations and i dont really have any native intuition on how to proceed
6626957 it is my purpose in this play to show the close connection between heaven and earth that is to say the possibility of using a baroque style that syle that relates the realities of earth to the realities of heaven is exciting to me because it seems allied with spiritual truth
6626958 i intend that the baroque style in its complexity and verbal richness should eventually reveal the sinew of intellectual accuracy and proportion besides spiritual elevation
6626959 sacrament of terror violence in the poetry of clinton f larson
6626960 reflects the dominant tendencies of the group an unquestioned optimism a pragmatism which spurns larsons baroque language in favor of the simple and direct and a capacity to be thrilled by oversimplified solutions by moral dilemmas resolved in rhyming couplets
6626961 some readers have seen in larsons work a tendency toward meaningless violence but those who question on this ground whether larsons poems are mormon might do well to reread sterling mcmurrin and truman madsen behind the oft noted baroque splendors of larsons style works a severe dynamic of mormon ideas
6626962 larson developed essentially without models or sympathetic peers a poetry of deep but critical faith able both to attack and affirm the world mormon history and mormon faith and he did all this with great and developing poetic skill as well as the intellectual and emotional power sufficient to energize his formal achievements a primary example of this is what i consider larsons finest poem to a dying girl a perfect jewel of a modern mormon lyric because it uses subtly varied traditional form to create precise understanding and proper emotional response to an important idea about the tragic claims of mortality in the face of sincere faith in immortality
6626963 why do you think england made the judgment he did
6626964 cfl comparing himself to dylan thomas does not surprise me at all
6626965 the first thing we do lets kill all the blowhards
6626966 and yet shakespeares comic character dick did not say the first thing we do lets kill all the blowhards
6626967 also p g keep in mind that shakespeares aptly named character represents the sociopathic rabble that hopes to benefit from anarchy
6626968 the function of mormon literary criticism as the present time
6626969 i am an artist and the church should support me and my art
6626970 i was hoping they would act as a beacon if he was nearby
6626971 the weather was great clear blue skies but i heard the weather report for later that day i knew there was wind coming
6626972 so i bundled up in a cocoon and sheltered myself against a bank
6626973 i geared up my kayak for everything it was wind proofed and rain proofed
6626974 i wasnt in trouble but they didnt know i wasnt in trouble there was no daylight left
6626975 we thought he was swamped the cellphone got wet or something or he might be out there in his life jacket or he might be injured

6626977 were going to be giving them the direct price right from tokyo
6626978 right now fishermen are auctioning off a lot of fish and getting paid minimum money compared to what they are worth in japan
6626979 it is a serious matter to assault a police officer in the execution of his duties
6626980 the court must take the strong position in protecting the law enforcement people the fact that he was intoxicated doesnt excuse his behaviour
6626981 police have a bad enough time doing their duties without people resisting
6626982 not that i expect socialists to respect property but still
6626983 it will just be with mayor and council and the mlas stewart said
6626984 it was requested that they just have it among themselves
6626985 i had a good chat with him but i dont know what mlas will make it
6626986 ich war geschockt im ersten moment nach bronze hatte er mir noch fr hlich gratuliert
6626987 the reason everyone is worrying about it now in august is because there is no reserve
6626988 that first snowstorm is going to hit and theres no salt
6626989 this could be a big issue depending on what kind of winter we have
6626990 were trying to put our feelers out see what we need to do to get some salt one way or another
6626991 at over 100 a ton those other products are starting to look attractive weve got a little time yet to decide how were going to approach this
6626992 now the concern is not only obtaining salt but what price our smaller communities will have to pay

6626996 it was 8 may 1987 at the cromwell hospital in london a transplant patients body was chronically rejecting her recently replaced liver a nationwide search located a suitable donor organ in hull and so began a life or death race against time to bring that organ to london the plane that was flying it to london was delayed by fog this meant that there was very little time to get the liver from the airport to the hospital the ambulance service did not have a fast enough vehicle the police helicopter was grounded so it was down to two metropolitan police cars to make the last vital stage of the journey the medical operation had already been started and surgeons were awaiting the arrival of the liver if it was not there by 12 30 pm the police were told to abort the run as it would be too late
6626997 it was good that she said my supporters need to now support barack obama

6627002 la culpable del accidente no es la crisis que atravesamos
6627003 es una tragedia un punto muy negro en nuestra historia

6627007 el trauma es como el de cualquiera que pierde a alguien ellos no lo ven tanto como una tragedia colectiva es como si se te muere alg n familiar en un accidente de tr fico

6627020 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6627021 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6627022 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6627023 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6627024 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6627025 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6627026 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6627027 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6627028 id been in touch with him twice every three weeks for almost a year before he died july 30 2007
6627029 i still have the last message he left me on my phone before he died bill was instrumental in so many ways to me not just to how i developed as a coach and as a player he was one of the people that i leaned on
6627030 after that my voice wasnt projecting enough to overcome 70 000 screaming nfl fans and cbs was unbelievably good to me
6627031 they tried every way to keep me on board but my voice just wouldnt hold up
6627032 he asked me to make sure none of his quarterbacks made the same mistakes i made when i played
6627033 i get to call the plays i get to do all the fun stuff i told them i didnt want the title of offensive coordinator i wanted to be offensive assistant that way they dont know who to aim their sniper shots at we run the no huddle offense just like we did in cincinnati we run a quick snap offense where you may be in a huddle but youre out of it so fast you dont give the defense time to recover
6627034 some of the parents are complaining about that being too much every so often every few days actually youll see a player look up after he made a block or executed a play and hell look back at you as if to say this time yesterday i didnt think i could do that and thats just beautiful
6627035 sometimes it will be refreshing and sometimes it will be whoops i shouldnt have said that
6627036 sometimes the best most innovative thing is stay the course but if you dont go ahead when you know something needs to be done and just do it do it right and do it to its completion youre just not being a very good public servant unfortunately we have too much of that people worrying too much about being re elected rather than representing the people
6627037 some of it is petty some of it is inevitable attacks by people who have strong emotional ties to your opponent
6627038 my opponent was born and raised here and has a large family and has an extended family some of it is like signs getting stolen and getting run over by pickups and flattened out the rumor was spread around that i was the man from atlanta where he grew up like thats where the boogey people live and they come to eat pickens people we were married here my wife is born and raised here we lived here when we first got married the first chance we could after my job allowed me to live where we wanted to live we moved to pickens so i thought id been pretty loyal
6627039 hes always been in charge and hes going to find out hes going to butt heads with the chairman we have now plus in pickens county hell have 13 000 boss men the people who elected him he never lied to the people because he never promised them anything he just came in as sam wyche and talked about football people forget that o j simpson played football too
6627040 theres nothing in our community that is available for our kids
6627041 the baseball field is located where there was a segregated elementary school destroyed by fire for him to come back to a small town and help like this its almost unheard of
6627042 the only negative i see is he can be such a driving force that it might rub the old boy network the wrong way pickens is 3 000 strong if something happens on the west side in the morning youll hear about it on the east side by the afternoon
6627043 my efforts are going to be made toward bringing some of that business to pickens county pickens along with many cities in the southeast lost a lot of jobs to the textile industry going overseas or outsourcing theres room here to grow the labor force is here the labor force unfortunately looks around and if they dont have a job they go where the jobs are
6627044 this is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody
6627045 we had a player who had a tough situation at home and needed a place to stay
6627046 we have already taken into consideration the utilization of venues after the games
6627047 it doesnt matter who they put in front of me im going to go out there to try to make him get better hes going to try to make me get better
6627048 right now its just the beginning of us gelling together as a team and thats our whole motto push each other
6627049 i just make sure during the week i prepare as hard as i can mentally and physically so when it comes to game time i dont have to worry about anything
6627050 every day you come out here and get to face these guys it starts to slow down a little bit
6627051 ive still got a lot of work to do and a lot of things to accomplish but its starting to slow down
6627052 to this end the society has committed to keeping the publication up to date as a living online resource through the books wiki at www nethistory co nz i urge readers of the book to contribute to the wiki helping to preserve the record of the internets development in new zealand

6627064 southerners have always had ridiculous arguments about whether the north began at watford or watford gap

6627096 hay que distinguir entre islam e islamismo no son lo mismo creo que el trailer no refleja bien esta distinci n b sica e importante el islamismo es condenable quiere imponer en todo el mundo la religi n del islam desde una lectura literal y fundamentalista de m s est decir que muchos musulmanes se oponen al islamismo y que la principal victima del islamismo son los principales musulmanes que mueren en atentados terroristas islamistas el islam por otra parte es una religi n como el resto seguramente hay muchos pasajes del coran que son condenables el tema es que cosa se enfatiza pasajes similares puden llegar a encontrarse en la biblia o la torah de hecho en la inquisici n la iglesia asesinaba con la excusa de la religi n por ende repito hay que distinguir entre islam e islamismo

6627135 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6627136 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and know about gene when he pulled around that left side its like a hurricane is coming through he wiped out everything that was there
6627137 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6627138 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6627139 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6627140 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6627141 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players
6627142 playing alongside of gene was an honour and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6627143 he fought me for a while saying no i dont want anything to do with it
6627144 but when i got elected to the executive board to the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field
6627145 all too often when you start talking about those old raider teams everybody just thinks they were a bunch of nuts who just happened to play well together
6627146 but gene played the same way he was as an executive with the players association gene was very clever he was a clever player he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you

6627185 that is what is great about the organization and fans no matter where we go in the world there are steelers fans everywhere its just great to be a part of it that picture speaks for itself we are everywhere
6627186 we know we have fans all over the world that just proves it right there its awesome to see the support of the united states and the steelers to have them back us like that is awesome
6627187 i bet there are more terrible towels in beijing because steelers fans are great sports fans

6627194 no s qu se necesita para ser una banda de culto redhead s lo es una banda underground que ha estado unida por mucho tiempo
6627195 este lbum lo quisimos hacer muy diferente a los anteriores ya que no nos gusta reciclar ideas
6627196 no entiendo mucho esa clasificaci n s lo s que hemos tocado por muchos a os y hemos hecho muchas cosas que sabemos nuestros l mites y cuando han surgido buenas y malas ideas s lo tratamos de promover nuestra m sica buscamos fans honestos no s qu es la m sica de culto o qu se necesita para serlo si empezara una banda y quisiera que fuera as no ser a como blonde redhead creo que s lo somos una banda underground que ha estado unida por mucho tiempo
6627197 no s c mo la cultura influye pero todos somos m sicos y creo que hacemos m sica porque estamos juntos porque queremos s hay una fusi n pero creo que la cultura tiene que ver m s con lo que hemos vivido en varios lugares como jap n italia y estados unidos pero no s qu es lo que hace diferente al sonido a partir de la cultura lo veo como una b squeda musical interna y a veces inesperada
6627198 es nuestra primera vez en guadalajara vamos abiertos a cualquier reacci n del p blico en el show tocamos a veces muy fuerte o muy tenue decidimos hasta que estamos en el escenario dependiendo del sonido y todos lo de alrededor nosotros nada m s tratamos de tocar nuestras canciones y sentir la m sica no sabemos si a la gente le gustar nos odiar o se aburrir pero tocamos de manera sincera
6627199 you treat it like a regular season game because you are going to be out there longer
6627200 i am out there trying to get better its a preseason game but its time to see where we are at as a team
6627201 thats how injuries occur if you dont prepare the same
6627202 most veteran guys we look forward to playing we are ready to play it stinks when you get warmed up and you just play a series or two this is the last preparation we are going to get until the regular season a lot of us want to go out there and play as much as possible
6627203 you dont want to show too much as far as game planning
6627204 it is the preseason and you dont want to show all of the plays you are going to use in the season and get it on tape its about finding 11 guys out there on the same page and seeing if we can gel as a team
6627205 we have to get used to the people that are in there
6627206 we are shuffling people around there are some new faces we have to get a feel for the line and get comfortable with the set line it really doesnt affect me it makes me better some offensive linemen do things different or better than others so it keeps me on my toes how i make my reads
6627207 i have a better understanding of what we are trying to do offensively it was a tough situation last week when i only had two days at the same time its getting better
6627208 i dont want to say i am fully getting the offense but i am getting the offense to the point where i know where the ball needs to go and what we are trying to do i am looking forward to it because i have a week to prepare instead of two days i am anxious and excited to go back out there on saturday
6627209 that is the game plan to try to finish out my career here
6627210 the steelers have been good to me i put all of my heart and soul into this and i am going to try and close it out
6627211 i didnt know how it was going to go you never know how it is going to go i wasnt too sure at first but they expressed to me they wanted to get something done we had some communication with my agent and we got a deal worked out i was confident in the steelers and my agent that we could get a deal done
6627212 james has played at an extremely high level the entire time i have been here
6627213 its a pleasure to get that deal done we are glad that its done its great to know he is going to be a part of us here in the future not only is he an outstanding player he is an outstanding professional he is an outstanding leader for us and has been a captain of our defense for awhile
6627214 it makes it a lot easier not worrying about your longevity here and where you might be next year
6627215 it gives you a level of comfort and ease that you know where you are going to be and this is your home

6627265 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6627266 lack of sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer
6627267 an obscure killer confined mostly to poor nations to the wests disease of the moment
6627268 11 892 women in the u s were told that they had cervical cancer in 2004 and 3 850 women died from the disease it is estimated that more than 2 billion is spent on the treatment of cervical cancer per year in the u s

6627277 although he did not make big bucks as liu and yao do now his life is so much better than the common people at the time
6627278 xu at least got a bonus after winning the gold but lang ping and the volleyball team got nothing even when they became the world champions and inspired a whole generation of chinese
6627279 i just had moved to playing defensive end and to be able to sack one of the top quarterbacks on national tv was pretty big for me it gets no bigger than that
6627280 i think hes going to be definitely somebody who other teams are going to prepare for put certain schemes on their game plans to stop him because one on one i dont think there are any tight ends that are going to block him and very few tackles in college football and the acc that will block him
6627281 with me and marvin on the same side i dont think anybody can afford to double team both of us

6627300 lots of styles and flavours have emerged if drunken tiger jo pd and jinusean formed an easy listening base for hip hop i think real hip hop will spring forth from that foundation

6627303 but while learning hip hop our personalities have changed were more free cool were like brothers
6627304 in the 1980s old school american hip hop was a way to survive a way to get out of crack out of the projects they didnt put records out cause hip hop was new they couldnt enjoy it

6627402 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6627403 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6627404 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6627405 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable

6627435 carbon nanotubes and mesenchymal stem cells biocompatibility proliferation and differentiation
6627436 as a biomaterials scientist i could see their potential in biomedical applications

6627692 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6627693 it has been a long battle to assert the right of all new zealanders to be heard on this controversial issue quite frankly in a democracy it should not require so much effort i want to pay tribute to sheryl savill who was prepared to put her name to the petition and the thousands of volunteers that have helped us collect over 390 000 signatures
6627694 justice delayed is justice denied prime minister 110 mps should never have ignored 80 of the population in the first place and the right thing to do now is to let every kiwi have their say as quickly as possible
6627695 t he medina message is not the fundamental universal eternal message of islam that founding message is from mecca so the reformation of islam must be based on a return to the mecca message in order to reconcile the mecca and medina messages into a single system muslim jurists have said that some of the medina verses have abrogated the corresponding earlier verses from mecca although the abrogation did take place and it was logical and valid jurisprudence at one time it was a postponement not a permanent abrogation
6627696 the mecca verses should now be made the basis of the law and the medina verses should be abrogated this counter abrogation will result in the total conciliation between islamic law and the modern development of human rights and civil liberties in this sense we reformers are superfundamentalists
6627697 islam in its essence is not a religion according to the common meaning of the word but rather a science its dogma being merely transitional to its scientific stage
6627698 we have said that the quran was divided between al islam as well as being revealed in two parts as meccan and medinese the meccan quran was revealed first in other words people were invited to adopt islam in the ultimate sense first and when they failed to do so and it was practically demonstrated that they were below its standard they were addressed in accordance with their abilities
6627699 in this way all the verses of persuasion though they constitute the primary or original principle were abrogated or repealed by the verses of compulsion jihad this exception was necessitated by the circumstances of the time and the inadequacy of the human capability to discharge properly the duty of freedom at that time
6627700 some muslim scholars believe that islamic wars were purely defensive wars a mistaken belief prompted by their keenness to refute claims by the orientalists that islam spread by means of the sword in fact the sword was used to curtail the abuse of freedom islam used persuasion for thirteen years in propagating its clearly valid message for the individual and the community when the addressees failed to discharge properly the duties of their freedom they lost this freedom and the prophet was appointed as their guardian until they came of age however once they embraced the new religion and observed the sanctity of life and property and the social claims of their kith and kin as they had been instructed the sword was suspended and abuses of freedom were penalized according to new laws hence the development of islamic sharia law and the establishment of a new type of government in justifying the use of the sword we may describe it as a surgeons lancet and not a butchers knife when used with sufficient wisdom mercy and knowledge it uplifted the individual and purified society
6627701 suffering death by the sword in this life is really an aspect of suffering hell in the next life since both are punishments for disbelief whoever adds to his own disbelief by inciting others to disbelief or to shun the path of god must be suppressed before he takes up arms in the cause of disbelief
6627702 islams original principle is freedom but the islamic religion was revealed to a society in which slavery was an integral part of the socioeconomic order it was also a society that was shown in practice to be incapable of properly exercising its freedom and therefore its individual members needed guidance hence the consequent enactment of jihad the muslims first had to offer to the unbelievers the new religion if they refused to accept it they had the second option of paying jizyah and living under muslim government while practicing their own religion and enjoying personal security if they also refused the option of jizyah the muslims would fight them and if victorious take some of them as slaves thereby adding to the number of those already in slavery
6627703 if an individual is invited to become the slave of god but refuses such refusal is symptomatic of ignorance that calls for a period of training
6627704 being so supreme islam has never been achieved by any nation up to the present day the nation of muslimin has not yet come it is expected to come however in the future of humanity
6627705 the key here is that no one should be allowed to own anything that permits the exploitation of one citizens labor to increase the income of another individual ownership even within such narrow boundaries should not be ownership of property as such but rather ownership of the benefits derived from property and all property remains in the ownership of god and the community as a whole as production from resources increases the equity of distribution is perfected and differences are reduced by raising both minimum and maximum incomes but the gap between minimum and maximum incomes is gradually narrowed in order to achieve absolute equality when such absolute equality is achieved through the grace of god and as a result of abundant production we shall achieve communism or a sharing of the earths wealth by all people communism thus differs from socialism in degree in the sense that socialism is a stage in the development towards communism the prophet experienced ultimate communism
6627706 as the prophet said justice shall fill the earth in the same way it was previously full of injustice this is what marx dreamed of but failed to find the way to achieve it can only be achieved by al muslimin who are yet to come and then the earth shall enjoy a degree of fulfillment of the verse the god fearing are in gardens and springs they will be told enter therein in peace and security we cleansed what was in their breasts of hatred so they became brothers sitting together never to feel hardship or be removed therefrom 15 45 48 this is the degree of communism to be achieved by islam with the coming of the nation of muslimin whence the earth shall light up with the light of its lord and gods grace is conferred upon its inhabitants when there shall be peace and love shall triumph
6627707 the texts in islam distinguish themselves from the texts of other religions by encouraging violence and aggression against people with other religious beliefs to a larger degree there are also straightforward calls for terror this has long been a taboo in the research into islam but it is a fact that we need to deal with
6627708 if it is correct that many muslims view the koran as the literal words of god which cannot be interpreted or rephrased then we have a problem it is indisputable that the texts encourage terror and violence consequently it must be reasonable to ask muslims themselves how they relate to the text if they read it as it is
6627709 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
6627710 throughout history rather than celebrating such biblical passages jews and christians have regarded them as a problem to be solved while interpretations of these passages differ widely among jews and christians from the beginning of rabbinic judaism and christianity one understanding has remained dominant among virtually all believers these passages are not commands for all generations to follow and if they have any applicability it is only in a spiritualized parabolic sense
6627711 the consensus view among jews and christians for many centuries is that unless you happen to be a hittite girgashite amorite canaanite perizzite hivite or jebusite these biblical passages simply do not apply to you the scriptures record gods commands to the israelites to make war against particular people only however this may be understood and however jarring it may be to modern sensibilities it does not amount to any kind of marching orders for believers thats one principal reason why jews and christians havent formed terror groups around the world that quote the bible to justify killing non combatants

6627737 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6627738 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6627739 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6627740 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6627741 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6627742 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6627743 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6627774 starting from when birth or school where he excelled to become president of law revue and graduated with honors or as a community organizer or his rise to state senate where he pushed through hundreds of new legislation or do we start at his election as a us senator where he sponsored 139 bills in 2 years including working with john mccain across the isle or him being the 1st minority of any kind to become the nominee to the presidency of the usa oops i havent even started and i surpassed 5 by far
6627775 he got more votes in the primary the mccain did
6627776 it is not what he has done you moron it is what he will do you stupid idiot he will make life better for even a sad retard like you
6627777 before man attempts to solve the secrets of universe he should master the universe within the kingdom of the self when he has accomplished this then he may and should go forth to gain the outer knowledge as a master demanding its secrets rather than as a slave begging for the crumbs from the table of knowledge

6627818 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6627819 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6627820 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement

6627825 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations

6627845 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6627846 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6627847 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future
6627848 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus

6627930 for years journalists have grumbled about the english libel laws and no one has listened but when a distant legislature passes a law of its own to counteract the intolerable effects of the british courts then its time to take notice the most startling recent legal story comes not from the high court but from albany where the new york state legislature has introduced the starkly named libel terrorism prevention act intended specifically to guard writers and publishers outside british jurisdiction from the terrors of english libel law
6627931 first the bca is able to sue because it is a
6627932 the claim form detailing the alleged libelous contents issued by the bca has not been published but one must presume that they are complaining that a direct or implied statement about the bca by simon singh has the effect of lowering their reputation rather than say the reputation of chiropractic generally

6627951 yet they fail to admit that as americans as being a part of a nation which allows for abortion and giving tax money to that government they are also guilty of support for abortion of course they are critical of it and speak out against it and put a few words out about it but that doesnt stop the fact that on another level they are giving support to the culture of death and abortion with it
6627952 one of my first journalistic adventures or misadventures concerned a comment on grant allen who had written a book about the evolution of the idea of god i happened to remark that it would be much more interesting if god wrote a book about the evolution of the idea of grant allen and i remember that the editor objected to my remark on the ground that it was blasphemous which naturally amused me not a little for the joke of it was of course that it never occurred to him to notice the title of the book itself which really was blasphemous for it was when translated into english i will show you how this nonsensical notion that there is god grew up among men my remark was strictly pious and proper confessing the divine purpose even in its most seemingly dark or meaningless manifestations

6628014 today the federal district court granted a stay of execution in the case of jeff wood to allow the court to consider compelling evidence that jeff wood is too mentally ill to be executed
6628015 held that the texas state courts have not carefully reviewed the question of woods competence and that a stay of execution is necessary to ensure that woods mental health issues are fully presented and considered by the courts
6628016 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary

6628018 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6628019 mr wood suffers today from the same psychological and emotional impairments for which a jury found him incompetent to stand trial in 1997
6628020 he has never received psychiatric or mental health care for these impairments
6628021 because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau

6628028 when hillary had her concession speech it was almost like a death in the sense that it was the death of a campaign something wed all worked so hard for its been a hard time my daughter just finished working for tim as intern on meet the press it makes you realize how important friends are how fleeting life is and how important it is to really step back and look at what really matters most family and friends and making a difference like tim obviously did and sen kennedy continues to do
6628029 i think they felt it was hillarys vote the working class blue collar vote i think its going to cause the campaign the most trouble they felt comfortable with hillary they knew her husband they felt prosperity under her husband and she became a champion for them with her long standing work in health care for women and children they felt a connection
6628030 the key is to show that barack is a man of faith that he understands their concerns just as hillary did that he will provide comprehensive health care and access to education and work on the economy and gas prices all the things people really care about beyond the war
6628031 you can understand why people look up to him hes cool very attractive very charismatic in an easy going way its kind of a laid back attitude that belies the intensity he must have to be in this position
6628032 hillarys always sort of been in the discussion shed certainly be my first choice shes been very steadfast in her support of him and sincere about it and ive encouraged him to choose her as his vice presidential candidate
6628033 but you hear different things on different days delaware sen joe biden indiana sen evan bey john kerry having been through it hes catholic he understands why he lost the catholic vote any of those three have the capabilities and strengths to be the right choice barack needs in terms of foreign policy experience
6628034 ambassadorship would be wonderful but im not sure its the right time family wise when we thought kerry was going to be elected the kids said i couldnt take an ambassadorship because they werent leaving unfortunately we didnt have to worry about that
6628035 timing is everything my first responsibility is to my children my daughter is going to stanford and my son is starting high school but there are lots of other roles i could fill
6628036 i dont just raise money its probably what i like the least ever since i was 5 campaigning for my father in elmira n y ive loved the give and take convincing people to be with the candidate im supporting hearing their concerns i like trying to solve problems and getting people involved in the process
6628037 as a citizen its not only your birthright but your responsibility to be as active a citizen as possible ive always been fascinated with the democratic process as flawed as it may be on a macro level on an idealistic level i do think politics is an honorable profession as robert kennedy said
6628038 there will be change either way but definitely for the better with barack having elected an african american and given his civil rights struggles that will go a long way to combating whatever bias we are perceived as having in the world community
6628039 i think mccain is well respected overseas as well this bush administration is not mainly because of the war and the policy in the past of going it alone and not working with allies as clinton and even his father did before that
6628040 i think he will raise taxes on the very very rich we have to get the economy back to at least reducing the deficits the war is costing trillions of dollars if were pulling out troops in 16 months as hes said he would do it will save an incredible amount of money and we can then focus on comprehensive health care then global warming and energy independence issues this administration hasnt dealt with at all
6628041 in addition to trying to get out of iraq there is the opportunity to become more interdependent to bring nations back together and having the will to work with our international allies there is a certain arrogance this administration had that we have to dispel
6628042 we would like to hope that our citizens wont break out the jet skis
6628043 if they do we are going to take quick action
6628044 with the mixture of an unusual weather event tied with the use of alcohol we would have a recipe potentially for disaster
6628045 disasters hurricanes wind storms we ve seen the after effects entire communities without power
6628046 ive been through all of those battles and i guess like a lot of people was feeling somewhat tired and wasnt sure i had the gumption to go at it with the california electorate yet one more time
6628047 ultimately does it really matter where they take the drink from
6628048 and the response was yes because as americans weve been taught since we were this high in civics class words like we hold these truths to be self evident and all men and women are created equal
6628049 there comes a point when a community of people like this eventually says you know what i am an american entitled to all the same rights and responsibilities as any other american thats whats right
6628050 if you all know where she is then why arent you doing anything besides getting on tv hollering at the public to find her i live in ky and if i could i would be out looking for her but all i can do is pray that god keeps her safe and brings her home soon
6628051 mengapa sapi sapi itu tidak dihentikan agar tidak berkelahi terus mengapa kedua sapi itu malah dihasut terus agar berkelahi dengan sengit
6628052 saya baru saja membeli kedua sapi jantan itu dan saya tidak bisa menggunakannya sebagai satu tim untuk menarik gerobak gerobak ini sebab mereka berkelahi terus karena itu keduanya harus bertarung dulu untuk menentukan yang mana dari keduanya yang akan menjadi bos salah satu dari sapi jantan ini pasti akan menyerah sehingga yang satunya menang sekali untuk selamanya maka saya pun akan bisa menggunakan mereka untuk menarik gerobak gerobak saya ini jika saya mengikat mereka sebagai pasangan untuk menarik gerobak ini sebelum keduanya berkelahi memperebutan posisi sebagai bos maka yang satu akan menarik gerobak ini ke timur sedangkan yang satunya bisa menariknya ke barat lalu akan berputar putar terus laksana perputaran jarum jam

6628134 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers however significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs yarls wood must seek to meet these concerns but they are ultimately issues for the uk border agency which must urgently address them
6628135 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6628136 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes

6628237 sigue creciendo y se trata de un pa s estable
6628238 en la fase de contracci n del ciclo econ mico
6628239 el pa s vive una expectativa de gasto de capital inversiones y consumo sumado a un reciente cambio de gobierno que siempre suele traer un clima de mejores expectativas y optimismo
6628240 el crecimiento hist rico de ecuador siempre ha sido bajo mientras que en argentina hay un incertidumbre en relaci n a la tasa de inter s un problema energ tico e inestabilidad pol tica que genera un clima poco positivo
6628241 la situaci n actual es evaluada como satisfactoria y est mejor que el promedio de los ltimos 10 a os 4 7 puntos en tanto que la percepci n sobre el futuro est dos puntos por debajo de la de julio del a o pasado 5 4 puntos y del promedio de los ltimos diez a os 5 5 puntos
6628242 la combinaci n en am rica latina de un ndice de situaci n actual satisfactorio con un ndice de expectativas negativo indica que la regi n est en una nueva fase descendiente del ciclo econ mico en el mundo en general tanto el ndice de situaci n actual 4 7 puntos como el ndice de expectativas 3 5 puntos muestran el deterioro de las condiciones
6628243 hay una predominancia muy clara de un clima econ mico de reducci n del nivel de actividad econ mica excepto paraguay per y uruguay todos los otros pa ses registran ndices de expectativas de los gastos de capital y de consumo por debajo de 5 0 puntos para los pr ximos sies meses

6628248 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
6628249 new yorkers should not have to beg for basic assurances that the air they breathe is not toxic
6628250 now were the ones who have to subsidise fuel for the company
6628251 obviously with the rising consumer prices that followed the fuel price hike people who were in the near poor category have become poor
6628252 we expect it to happen two or three months after the fuel price hike but after that the level will be normal again
6628253 everything has become more expensive including cooking oil and flour
6628254 whoever the president is is the same little people like us will always suffer
6628255 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
6628256 to cut to the chase on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
6628257 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
6628258 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
6628259 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
6628260 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
6628261 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
6628262 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
6628263 we have a watchdog that has bark but no bite
6628264 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
6628265 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
6628266 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
6628267 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
6628268 which i bought out of curiosity but which disappointed me terribly
6628269 i did not think he would be as far along
6628270 i knew he was a fast guy a tough guy but hes got a good grasp of the offense hes going to be a heck of a player for us hes having a great camp
6628271 hopefully we dont have to play him much or at all but i wouldnt have any reservations of handing him the football
6628272 i definitely have intentions on being a running back at the next level
6628273 im playing my part hopefully at the next level i can finally start be able to live my dreams a little bit more but for the time being i will suck it up and keep a good positive attitude and do my job
6628274 but ive come to the understanding im a fullback accept the facts under my name it doesnt say running back it says conredge collins fullback youve got to just do your job
6628275 he is extremely aggressive hes a tough guy and he likes to hit people
6628276 so the only thing thats really holding him back is the experience factor
6628277 hell make three or four really good blocks and he may be poor on one or two hes giving effort but there is something for being consistent
6628278 my opportunity will come pitt coach dave wannstedt says it all the time
6628279 everybody knows that so i was injured and was a freshman so it was a little rough but behind everything he does there is a reason for it he mentally and physically trains us
6628280 i just want to go back out there and put together a season like my junior year and hopefully everything falls into place
6628281 its been a long time coming but i feel tremendous
6628282 he dropped two balls that were very critical in a team setting but came back the next practice and made the plays he was supposed to make
6628283 thats what we need from him that consistency and hes shown it and hes added the ability to run after the catch and thats just a recognition of where the defense is and playing with great speed hes also become a much more physical blocker
6628284 weve known all along he has the big play ability but to be a great one you have to be locked in and focused on every snap and make every catch he has also worked hard on playing stronger and playing against press coverage the bottom line is hes got to play well for us to be successful

6628286 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6628287 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6628288 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6628289 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6628290 i really like this bit but found that last bit rather confusing obscure contradictory
6628291 i know for a fact that he never called her i checked his call logs
6628292 when i first saw a briefing on the predator three years ago i saw one of my mission sets disappear i miss the thrill of flying but hanging around for hours in a plane is a waste of manpower
6628293 we have just won a war with a lot of heroes flying around in planes the next war may be fought by airplanes with no men in them at all
6628294 it is possible to build a transoceanic missile right now
6628295 but we dont know whether it will land in spain portugal or france
6628296 uavs success is not due to a single breakthrough but a combination of innovations in several areas
6628297 you may not have the fear of death but all the other fears are still there the fear of the unknown and the fear of failure
6628298 paradoxically as a result of our success the target has become even more decentralized even more diffused and presents a more difficult target no question about that
6628299 its clear that the u s is prepared to use and deploy these weapons in a fairly wide theater
6628300 we have the plans in place to do them globally
6628301 in most cases we need the approval of the host country to do them however there are a few countries where the president has decided that we can whack someone without the approval or knowledge of the host government
6628302 an alarming precedent and a clear case of extrajudicial killing
6628303 zawahiri is an easy case no one is going to question us going after him
6628304 but where can you do it and who can you do it against who authorizes it all of these are totally unregulated areas of presidential authority
6628305 paris its easy to say we wont do it there
6628306 i dont think anyone is dealing with solid footing here there is legal as well as operational doctrine that is being developed as we go along
6628307 you give shelter to al qaeda figures you may well get your village blown up
6628308 conversely you have to note that this can also create local animosity and instability
6628309 i think the attack was a major screw up because so many kids died it raises questions about the entire process

6628312 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6628313 is there a difference between a chart i got online and a consultation with an
6628314 i have been in this void and nothing seems to be changing
6628315 it exterminates all in its path and is planning domination of the known universe starting with wolverhampton
6628316 do you think this would go down well with the girls on a night out
6628317 to have the longest sentence for cruelty handed down at just four months i dont think is adequate
6628318 we have to send a very strong message to these perpetrators that these acts of violence and cruelty will not be tolerated in our community
6628319 it is time to get on with it and get this reform done
6628320 its interesting that the recall of parliament has occurred at the same time as the resurrection of rumours of a cabinet reshuffle

6628327 nature whose status as a norm of beauty or as an ideal form waned has since returned as a condition for the sustainability of all built environment as such nature plays a role in the twenty first century that is as central as it ever was in the past the challenges are enormous and the markets and demands seem boundless when bill mcdonough the famous nature design architect in the united states plans the construction from scratch of cities and villages in china he connects with his starkly nature inspired buildings in the us the gap headquarters in san bruno california 1997 the ford rouge dearborn truck plant in michigan 2004 with its half million square foot habitat roof the largest in the world or the ibm office in amsterdam 2004 and suggests that he will figuratively speaking put entire communities under a turf or even a rice field roof which looks just the same as the landscape did prior to the construction of the city residential areas and workplaces will be mixed energy will come from solar panels and public transportation will be within easy walking distance with the airport in the center and a jade necklace of parks liuzhou these visions mark a kaleidoscopic return to ebenezer howards and others concentric utopias of the early twentieth century
6628328 the us sanctions initially had a negative impact on the banks reputation and created troubles but in practice there was no halt in our operations
6628329 we are now working with important international commercial and correspondent banks on a daily basis including european asian and african ones
6628330 this economy has its own attractions even under the worst conditions
6628331 it will be troublesome if europe imposes unilateral sanctions on irans banks but we will be able to again replace the outgoing banks
6628332 domestic investment on its own cannot meet the countrys needs which makes iran an opportunity for foreign banks particularly as investment banks not retail banks to function as gates in attracting foreign investment
6628333 riddled with internal problems and are mainly aiming to raise internal troop morale
6628334 the time has come to change the countrys course and renounce this ambivalent policy with islamism algerians do not have the impression the state is throwing all its resources into this fight
6628335 the aim of the cycle of upsurges is really to gain attention both in the public press and the international media theres no evidence to suggest its going away its almost certain there will be further large scale attacks over the next few months
6628336 there are periods of high activity alternating with periods of low activity because the group cannot sustain the pace of attacks over a long period they need to re group to prepare for the next round
6628337 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter
6628338 this coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
6628339 in both cases these acquisitions are really targeted at what were seeing as the natural evolutionary course of whats happening in data warehousing and analytics
6628340 all of the data warehouses that weve deployed are used in application environments where people are running business intelligence and more sophisticated analytics that they were unable to run in their prior environment either because of the complexity of having to tune those legacy databases or specific types of queries or because of other performance constraints
6628341 consider the fact that microsoft is touting enhancements in geospatial data handling as one of the most important themes in its recently released sql server 2008 all of which is available to the microsoft partner and customer dw bi data warehouse business intelligence applications and tools that run on or integrate with that spanking new dbms
6628342 more data warehouses are managing location data as another sometimes co equal data domain or entity hence netezza as a data warehousing solution provider recognizes that it needs to strengthen its capabilities in this area lest it lose business to oracle microsoft ibm and others that have strong location intelligence technologies built into their bi dw dbms stacks
6628343 both these acquisitions are targeted at driving an analytics agenda
6628344 in the case of what weve acquired with nutech were really looking to exploit an opportunity in the market around advanced analytics integrating the ideas around data warehouse and analytics with nutechs very advanced technology in the areas of data mining predictive analytics and optimization
6628345 just do one bit and back out when you cant get any further
6628346 there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6628347 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables are well worth having in
6628348 the most advanced version of any strategy agreement between the us and any other country in the world
6628349 us negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6628350 we are prepared to consider a request on the new purchase of arms and are ready to deliver weapons of a defensive character that do not violate the strategic balance of power in the middle east
6628351 we know what are the connections between iran and syria we know what are the connections between syria hizbollah hamas and other terrorist organisations
6628352 i will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems i will not weaponize space
6628353 the us sanctions initially had a negative impact on the banks reputation and created troubles but in practice there was no halt in our operations

6628358 he has played a very positive and influential role if he disappeared from the scene it would a bit of a gap
6628359 there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6628360 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6628361 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6628362 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6628363 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6628364 there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6628365 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables are well worth having in

6628370 we looked long and hard for a company that could not only offer us but our readers as well a unique experience when reading the magazine
6628371 organization dedicated to improving the administration of justice by providing leadership and service to court systems in the united states
6628372 the purpose is basically to educate kids middle school and high school aged about how the justice system operates and about what really goes on in the courtroom as opposed to what you see on television
6628373 hush now we will find a way to get through this i promise

6628375 many consider downloading music without paying for it to be a victimless crime but nothing could be further from the truth

6628377 i have a blackberry pearl and the web browsing on it sucks like a tornado what i want is a web browsing device that rocks me like a hurricane id rather not have something large even as large as a netbook like the eee pc there are the nokia tablets theres the archos 605 705 wifi there are umpcs like the q1 ultra then theres the iphone ipod touch im looking for something that i can access the internet on from the couch or the john with a full html browser and i need something that wont break the bank

6628380 hey can you pick up a black ink cartridge on the way home
6628381 but i never noticed the printouts fading or streaking ah well its only about 30 for a new one wait 30
6628382 is a classic loss leader way of getting you hooked on a product by offering it free or almost free so big companies give away the razors or printers knowing in a few months youll be back to buy the overpriced blades or ink cartridges
6628383 give me a new ink cartridge or im going on strike
6628384 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6628385 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6628386 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6628387 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6628388 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6628389 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6628390 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6628391 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6628392 an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage
6628393 otherwise it would be too inconvenient for people and will largely decrease the efficiency of the city
6628394 actually nowadays many ordinary people sincerely hope that the games could finish sooner
6628395 business is a little better because of the olympics but not a whole lot
6628396 everybody said that when the olympics come we would make a small fortune but everybody was wrong
6628397 he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6628398 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long
6628399 discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6628400 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife
6628401 were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6628402 there is no benefit to pupils in doing 11 or 12 gcses it is better to have eight or nine good gcses
6628403 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt
6628404 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6628405 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6628406 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression in fact the study found that quality of life was actually lower in the women taking hormone therapy in the first few months of commencing treatment
6628407 david has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6628408 every day of the week and every week of the year
6628409 we owe you a huge debt of gratitude for everything you have done
6628410 this week we are celebrating the olympics where weve had great success but this week also i believe our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that youve shown exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6628411 it is good to see him here it is good to hear our work is being appreciated
6628412 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6628413 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
6628414 hes managed to get his entire program through with the help of the liberals and the bloc qu b cois so its actually not a valid complaint
6628415 id love to see a prime minister who says lets all roll up our sleeves and work together
6628416 im not holding my breath but thats what id like to see
6628417 lets put an end to the harper policies and government take it to the canadian people
6628418 by the grace of god they all got out of the way
6628419 for the shape hes in hes in pretty good shape
6628420 perhaps he saw the children on the field and tried to turn at the last minute

6628423 might have imposed a lesser sentenced had he known that it was permissible to deviate from the 100 to 1 crack powder ratio based on a disagreement with policy
6628424 based on this evidence we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found lipscomb guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
6628425 expert advocacy on the part of assistant u s attorney donald c skip lockhart resulted in the affirmation of the conviction which was well earned despite the peripatetic legal claims
6628426 obviously the kimbrough resentencing will be very important to mr lipscomb we will review the opinion and proceed from there
6628427 every day i sit across an array of senators who range from casually indifferent to those who think this is all a big hoax
6628428 i dont want people to look back years from now and say we did nothing
6628429 clearly all the observations point to the unequivocal fact that climate change is happening and humans are the cause
6628430 but well see horrendous property damage and it will happen in neighborhoods people thought were safe
6628431 i wish i could say we felt like we made some progress but unfortunately not a lot was made
6628432 we certainly have no reason to believe theres going to be a strike
6628433 in these negotiations nobody has said or done anything that would give any kind of signal to me that anybody has intentions of going on strike
6628434 were still negotiating obviously major issues in any contract are salary and benefits
6628435 what i have to reference is discussions we had last year so what i saw this time was a great first step
6628436 when i left last thursday i was pleasantly surprised and optimistic we could achieve great things
6628437 my expectation is we will be bargaining in good faith negotiations are hard but i am certain we will be successful in attaining a fair contract im sure thats the desire by both parties
6628438 it will be a challenge but weve always done our jobs
6628439 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6628440 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6628441 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6628442 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6628443 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6628444 no ive got a friend to go see ill just go see him
6628445 queria saber se estava mentindo a mim mesma mas tudo confere n o estou ficando louca se houver realmente um xtase ele ter de ser ent o do g nero da mais pura gua algo que eu sempre desejei algo que n o precise necessariamente durar ou melhor n o precise durar condi o sine qua non
6628446 probably as healthy as hes been in camp right now
6628447 i dont think weve ever been this healthy at this time of year
6628448 im the prime minister of a country of 28 million people
6628449 hes the president of a country with 1 2 billion im not allowed to tell the premier of saskatchewan or quebec what to do am i supposed to tell the president of china what to do
6628450 you want me to tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective
6628451 from the knee to the ankle area covered in bites
6628452 i didnt really feel anything bothering me while eating i woke up the next day and noticed i had bumps all over my legs
6628453 sharon and i spoke on monday and by happenstance figured out we were at the same place
6628454 i didnt feel anything until late in the night early the next morning the next day and i had what i would think of as an infestation of bites from the knees down
6628455 quite frankly i have gotten mosquito bites in the past and this was nothing like that
6628456 some people have asked me whether i am angry at god because my son is no longer here
6628457 but how can i be mad at a god who holds my son safely in his arms tonight its hard knowing that i wont see my son again on earth but i have the assurance that christopher is in heaven because he put his faith in jesus i havent lost my son because i know where he is and someday i will join him

6628646 it may be the most beautifully written novel ive read this year
6628647 the unresolved is a great one mallory is the most well developed ghostly character ive seen in a long long time
6628648 initially t k welshs the unresolved read like a traditional historical novel albeit with a narrator who dies in the opening chapter welsh does an excellent job of detailing the tragedy of the general slocum the unresolved scores on several levels most notably as a drama that blows apart all preconceived notions of how history can be retold mallory is a very engaging protagonist both alive and dead but it is as she evolves as a ghost that she will truly resonate with readers equal parts na ve and determined eventually she becomes a force to be reckoned with and the true face of an avenging ghostly angel
6628649 mallory travels through time and space haunting the survivors and those culpable in the disaster though most dont know that shes there
6628650 this book is a haunting chronicle of the ways things can go wrong one decision at a time and the way people hide from the truth and lie to protect themselves
6628651 mallorys story begins on the day she dies soon after her first kiss the steamship on which she is traveling goes up in flames and because of her old waterlogged life jacket she drowns
6628652 shes not the only one to die in the accident the lifeboats are rusted to the deck the water hoses rotten and the lifejackets useless so many of her friends and neighbors as well as her little sister die that day in new york city
6628653 mallory is a silent incorporeal observer to the aftermath of the accident unable to move on into whatever comes next for spirits who leave this world
6628654 the aftermath of the accident when everyone is trying to assign the blame to someone anyone is very interesting its a look at the way justice worked in 1904 and its not particularly different from the way it seems to work today this is a gripping story that will surely keep readers attention

6628657 one day in the middle of a big storm victor climbed up the mainmast all the way to the topgallant trying to escape from a crew member whom he had accused of stealing food
6628658 a cabin boy who cannot walk is of no value to this ship throw him overboard
6628659 clinging to a gaff victor drifted in the middle of the sea for several days until he arrived at the coast of england

6628661 resurrection men is an intense dark work of historical fiction that made me read every page intently to the end while trying to cope with the knot of sadness and anguish that i had in my stomach

6628701 foi uma vit ria convincente diria at que foi o melhor primeiro tempo do flamengo sob o meu comando um resultado para devolver a confian a ao time e nossa torcida
6628702 ser um jogo muito dif cil e muito complicado mas o flamengo gosta de jogar fora de casa temos pontuado bastante mas temos que nos preparar
6628703 para pensar em t tulos temos que somar mais do que os 31 pontos que n s somamos no primeiro turno
6628704 estou muito feliz porque eu tive tr s momentos no jogo recebi um cart o amarelo fiz a falta que deu origem ao gol do gr mio e marquei o gol da vit ria um dia de gl ria para mim e espero que a gl ria maior venha com a conquista do t tulo
6628705 foi um rev s que n o esper vamos e que n o estava na nossa conta isso nos faz ter a obriga o de pontuar contra o n utico em recife perdemos a chance de abrir mais vantagem para o segundo colocado

6628821 there appears to be a shift taking place in the pc industry the move from 32 bit to 64 bit pcs weve been tracking the change by looking at the percentage of 64 bit pcs connecting to windows update and have seen a dramatic increase in recent months the installed base of 64 bit windows vista pcs as a percentage of all windows vista systems has more than tripled in the u s in the last three months while worldwide adoption has more than doubled during the same period another view shows that 20 of new windows vista pcs in the u s connecting to windows update in june were 64 bit pcs up from just 3 in march put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops

6628853 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6628854 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6628855 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6628856 as a community it would be great to have all our sporting facilities at the same site
6628857 weve got lots of sporting clubs and facilities that need updating and replacing and it would be good to have a multi use centre where we can have better facilities that we can all use
6628858 wed be looking at all sporting groups that would be interested in joining a multi use centre
6628859 its something thats been talked about for years so as a community well now be looking at whether it has any possibility of fruition
6628860 one of the problems we have in our small towns is that our communities and our committees are getting smaller and it makes sense that we pull some of our groups together
6628861 it makes it easier to raise money and to run particular functions
6628862 the first stage is to talk to the various groups to make sure that we have community support
6628863 then we will obtain some funding to put a master plan together
6628864 the old water treatment plant is past its service date and while it has served the community well it is no longer up to standard and we need to protect the environment
6628865 the new wastewater treatment plant will more than double the capacity of what we have
6628866 the current one doesnt operate as a lagoon system its what you would call a mechanical plant it has tanks and settling chambers and a trickling filter which are common features of plants in the 1970s
6628867 the new system is based on lagoons a more natural process which breaks down the organic matter through interaction with microbes in the lagoon
6628868 the idea of wet weather storage is that during summer you irrigate and during winter you dont you hold it until youre ready to irrigate
6628869 top 4 receivers are out for saturday is laying it on a little thick it is amazing how andre caldwell is listed as a top 4 receiver when he has yet to play in the first half of a game not to mention maxwell suddenly winning the 3 job
6628870 you have to engage people not there to see you
6628871 we said this one is for the giants by the end they were all singing along with the refrain la la la
6628872 her music brings together theatrical imagination global awareness and its still playful
6628873 their music really touches on the growing complexity of identity as borders are being crossed at so many different levels
6628874 it was the opposite of california where i felt like the other kids but looked different
6628875 i was the brown girl who kicked ass in math
6628876 at first i felt ridiculous they looked so down and out and here we come with our instruments
6628877 then we finished the first song and everyone went crazy it was one of our best shows
6628878 when shes working she disappears she might not even return phone calls
6628879 ill take up the cd and practice along to it
6628880 as i listened to her heart in the icu she kept asking me how do you make a friend
6628881 i had no answer i eventually wrote a song about questions that cant be answered
6628882 i realized love and death are two things you cant choose and have no control over
6628883 reacting to bush is not as powerful as imagining another way
6628884 i wanted people to appreciate beauty in something they didnt understand
6628885 but i wanted people to google it and find out that its really about torture
6628886 you can hear we are having a good time in our music like a drunken clown just on the verge of falling apart
6628887 i love playing in little cramped places where you can see peoples faces
6628888 i want to take it further how about car washes and elevators
6628889 instead of that vacation to vegas or where ever else i would be going this is by far a more valuable experience to me
6628890 i was lucky to have a birthday recently so instead of gifts people decided to donate money to me
6628891 so ungef hr muss hitler auch durch wien gegangen sein
6628892 aside from our ground troops we are shelling their positions they are strong so we have to use air support
6628893 we also fired several howitzer rounds to drive away hundreds of rebels in the village of tapikan mamasapano and in the remote areas of datu saudi and datu piang towns
6628894 schools and all other available public buildings including mosques are currently serving as temporary shelters of these people
6628895 we are running against the members of three base commands
6628896 anybody who will support these groups that we are pursuing will join them and sympathize with them becomes also part of our operations
6628897 anybody who harbors the fugitive becomes liable its that simple
6628898 there is no all out war we are stepping up military operations so there will be all out peace in mindanao
6628899 we tried all the peaceful means necessary but for some of the groups this is the only language they understand
6628900 all of us want peace and the autonomous government supports any peace initiative that is anchored on the constitution and through public consultation
6628901 employing force and intimidation by attacking towns and villages in the region just to get the attention of the national government is a form of terrorism and considered a high profile criminal offense
6628902 our own innocent muslim brothers and sisters whom we are supposed to protect
6628903 the greatest argument for this recall move is that panlilios own avid supporters are saying that he failed them
6628904 we have to monitor the developments in the next weeks until the petition is officially filed with the comelec
6628905 our fellow kapampangan want reforms and thats what we have been trying to lead and institute all these months the recall move is not about me it is largely about our crusade for good governance
6628906 politically people will reject it and legally it cannot prosper because theres a pending protest against panlilio
6628907 he has no clear directions and programs of actions and of late the bickering has spread among his own supporters
6628908 she has nothing to do with this we work on donations truth is this might even negate her recount case against among father ed
6628909 a hundred pieces of shrapnel still in my body one eye out one ear no longer hearing but what we did at plaza miranda was historic it is a symbol of what the people are prepared to do to defend their liberty and democracy
6628910 extraordinary valorous participation in the democratic processes of the country
6628911 aug 21 1971 is historic for our party and our country because since then the writ of habeas corpus was suspended a year and a month later martial law was declared and the country fell under a dictatorship thats why were here to mark this memorable day and renew our pledge to never let this happen again
6628912 i am still in a daze i was so confused and surprised for now i will remain an opposition against the present administration i will have to think hard about that joining the lp
6628913 if the liberal party is welcome in manila mayor lim is very very much welcome in the liberal party
6628914 they are not really with the milf but mere curious seekers of life in the mountains
6628915 it is unfortunate that the government is using every means to discredit the milf to cover up its treachery in kuala lumpur for not signing the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain in malaysia last august 5
6628916 he was just eating grass and all of a sudden there was a loud sound of a gunshot
6628917 he started howling and sticking his tongue out panting for breath
6628918 they stopped to lay down in front of the big tree near the curb on my side and he shot at them twice
6628919 they killed my cat one shot dead aim into the left lung
6628920 he would just lay in my lap and sleep and hold his head up because he loved to be rubbed under the head
6628921 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6628922 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6628923 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6628924 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6628925 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6628926 id like to get a first round of review on my axfs filesystem
6628927 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6628928 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6628929 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby
6628930 some people might choose to buy chooks so they have their own eggs or create a worm farm
6628931 others might install water tanks and revamp their garden everyones a winner
6628932 proposals for improvement projects must be considered and evaluated on a state wide basis
6628933 any improvements to the wimmera river bridge will be considered in this context
6628934 vicroads will continue to monitor the traffic and pedestrian safety issues at this site
6628935 they have the responsibility and at this time they dont think its warranted
6628936 we will be recommending it for their future safety programs
6628937 i was walking north across the bridge on the east side near the showground when a load of young people in a car came around the roundabout too fast and their hubcap came off
6628938 it went across the road and into the path of where i was walking it was a dangerous situation
6628939 there was a family walking nearby and i yelled out to them to stop
6628940 the cars are travelling in a straight line its too dangerous around the bend
6628941 if youre going to ride my at least pull my hair
6628942 our mate phil was a loyal mate although crazy at times
6628943 phil not only meant a great deal to us but each and everyone of us he shared his life with
6628944 were all better for having had phil in our lives and we will all miss him deeply
6628945 he had his first mini bike when he was seven years old
6628946 riding around the quarry was a favourite pastime he would get out there whenever possible
6628947 great now we can see naked arses in the dark
6628948 new orleans is of such key importance to american music because historical factors combined to make it the strongest center of african musical practice in the united states and cliches aside that practice really did travel up the mississippi and did spread overland
6628949 i heard a group called huey smith amp the clowns out of new orleans now this is where funk was really created thats where funk originated i couldnt understand how to do it so this drummer from huey smiths band hungry williams showed me how to play it
6628950 a lot of those new orleans drummers would come through and i got a lot of stuff from those guys tenoo coleman was as funky as any of them i learned some of that funk by listening to tennoo
6628951 at the risk of sounding egotistical a lot of the broken up stuff that these guys are playing now stems from the stuff that i had started doing
6628952 dont be fooled this city is deeply wounded id say its like an amputee with phantom memory
6628953 if there was no new orleans america would just be a bunch of free people dying of boredom
6628954 why do we care who these guys are if theres no reason to draft them
6628955 i have a blackberry pearl and the web browsing on it sucks like a tornado
6628956 the committee will report to the public what the situation with the lake is and two gwmwater board members who are not on the executive committee will be invited to advise the meeting and answer questions
6628957 people are urged to attend and be part of the future of this valuable social setting
6628958 people are very concerned about what is happening and they want to know the answers
6628959 do you think that obamas supporters will rally around hrc in 2012
6628960 with all the backstabbing the democrats did to hillary and bill clinton it would be right for them to back mccain now
6628961 graduated magna cum laude from harvard law school and being editor of the law review yea only dummies do that
6628962 last june a record 91 percent of harvard students graduated summa magna or cum laude far more than at yale 51 percent princeton 44 percent
6628963 did you see the show last night showing what mccains incompetence as a pilot cost 130 lives on aircraft carrier
6628964 i find it sublime that sen mccains top economic advisor is the architect who singlehandedly almost destroyed hewlett packard with a disastrous merger with compaq several years ago
6628965 if she or her husband think that obama can secure his spot in 2008 without all of the original democratic base they and you will be sadly and bitterly disappointed
6628966 you never wanted to hear their name come up in any context other than playing golf

6628971 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
6628972 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6628973 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6628974 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6628975 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6628976 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6628977 i still think we all need to stay on our toes

6628980 also the police had the whole parade route filmed and they are reviewing the tape so they can arrest the assailant
6628981 kayden kross displayed beauty and brawn what a combination she handled the whole thing like a pro and is looking forward to meeting fans today in the first day of the erotica lifestyle expo

6628987 what is wrong with this stupid dishwasher none of our dishes are clean
6628988 just shoot me and put me out of my misery
6628989 hey i figured out what was wrong with the dishwasher and why none of the dishes were clean apparently the soap dispenser jammed or something and it didnt open
6628990 the soap dispenser in that dishwasher isnt supposed to open youre supposed to leave it open every cycle
6628991 past returns tell you nothing about future returns and are not the right way to select investments
6628992 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
6628993 its hard to imagine state of maine racing without the campbell connection
6628994 the campbell family have always come to the forefront in the industry with drew today continuing that tradition by starring in a series local television commercials ironically with cc bag a luck as his co star
6628995 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
6628996 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6628997 staff had some overlapping responsibilities and as a result we could function with fewer staff logistics i cant comment on but on the services side there have been some restructured responsibilities
6628998 it was originally one division and we decided to break it out to provide a better focus but weve now decided to fold it back in because there were so many similarities
6628999 we will bear the entire cost of the rise in price of foreign liquor as it is a matter of our prestige
6629000 if we increase the price of foreign liquor we may lose our regular customers
6629001 we are ready to make less profit but cannot afford to lose our customers if we increase the price our customers will prefer to party indoors
6629002 we will go slow on the purchase of foreign liquor as 30 per cent of my patrons have switched to indian brands which are less expensive
6629003 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6629004 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6629005 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen

6629010 more than 500 members from various organisations and institutions in chandigarh and its surrounding towns will participate in a three km cycle rally
6629011 the word unbuttoned appealed to me unbuttoning is not an act but an attitude though it was hectic i involved myself in this the word unbuttoned has a meaning for me i saw all the international ads that they have shot for the 501 button fly and being a part of this was certainly exciting i am very selective in choosing the brands i endorse the image and positioning of the brand is of utmost importance everything else is secondary
6629012 pkr is lying about choose anwar you get a prime minister
6629013 aamir is not just the face of the atithi devo bhava campaign he will actively participate in various events throughout the year that will involve creating awareness about the safety and goodwill of foreign tourists through his blog aamir will also address the issue and talk about it to people around the world

6629020 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision

6629022 we applaud the court for upholding jeff woods rudimentary due process right to have his competency evaluated
6629023 i knew that if i didnt get a transplant i was going to die
6629024 i know she was 15 years also and i dont know where she was from
6629025 throughout the united states there are over 100 000 people just about men women and children who are waiting to receive a lifesaving organ transplant
6629026 for her to have put down that she was going to be an organ donor to help out somebody else i think that that extremely nice of someone to do
6629027 dont worry just like the previous version the hacked 3g iphone handset too can be used with all networks
6629028 i have been saving money for the iphone launch in india but due to the high price i have asked my cousin to get it from the us i will get it unlocked here
6629029 the user will not be able to optimally use the phone when the code is cracked as they will face problems in using premium services like itunes
6629030 the features in both handsets are the same even the look is identical but nothing can compete with the original

6629032 a train will be able to bring up empty container wagons and immediately turn around and take away a full load
6629033 were a little bit further down the line in how were improving the rail service
6629034 ultimately it will be of benefit to everyone in the region
6629035 i think anything that gives a motivation to go to school is a worthwhile investment
6629036 this is just one way to give kids rewards in families who likely cant afford those things were going to be dealing with high poverty schools here
6629037 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
6629038 it is violence to corrupt nature for a man to be holy to lie down under christs feet
6629039 dear sir i always saw nature mighty lofty heady and strong in you and that it was more for you to be mortified and dead to the world than for another common man you will take a low ebb and a deep cut and long lance to go to the bottom of your wounds in saving humiliation to make you a won prey for christ be humbled walk softly down down for gods sake my dear and worthy brother with your topsail stoop stoop it is a low entry to go in at heavens gate it is violence to corrupt nature for a man to be holy to lie down under christs feet to quit will pleasure worldly love earthly hope and an itching of heart after this painted and over gilded world and to be content that christ trample upon all

6629092 its keeping your head in an awkward position that is pushed forward with your ears in front of your shoulders for a long time that makes your neck hurt
6629093 thats what many people who have neck problems are doing
6629094 beauticians for example work in a bent over position all day long
6629095 in the early 1990s municipal solid waste management underwent a sea change and msw management magazine played an instrumental role in ushering in the new era
6629096 the new mswmanagement com allows professionals to draw upon the experience of the community that weve built
6629097 with this interactive web site we hope to offer our readers a new way to achieve their goals by providing a place they can share information and benefit from the knowledge and experience that exists in communities everywhere we know our readers know a lot more about solid waste management than we do and we are happy to let them prove us right
6629098 we wanted something simple and performance driven but with lots of pyro just fire everywhere
6629099 and by all accounts that is exactly what we will be getting this weekend
6629100 a institui o religiosa que recebe como doa o valor muito superior s posses do doador sem devida cautela responde civilmente pela conduta desidiosa
6629101 mesmo antes de 1996 ano em que o autor passou a freq entar as depend ncias da igreja e a fazer lhe doa es j apresentava grave quadro de confus o mental capaz de caracterizar sua incapacidade absoluta j que no laudo pericial restou consignado que ele n o reunia discernimento suficiente para a realiza o dos atos da vida civil
6629102 this government is going to see significant and extended industrial action for the coming months unless they wake up to themselves and actually make an offer that means that the real wages are maintained over the next couple of years in a high inflation environment
6629103 the reserve bank understands this the federal government understands it inflation is high 3 25 per cent wont fix it
6629104 the state government is trying to force public sector workers in main roads in qbuild in hospitals and in schools across the board to try and cut their wages by only offering 3 25 per cent when inflation is running at 5 per cent
6629105 this is unfortunate that the government wants to basically to cut wages and no one can afford to do that in the present economic climate
6629106 so the government and the minister involved warren pitt main roads minister are going to have to have a reality check
6629107 this is the strongest strident our members have taken so theyre sending out the message theyre very very serious about getting a decent pay
6629108 elementary my dear watson sir mccain has so many houses the dog did bark since he didnt even recognize his owner
6629109 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6629110 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by electric fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6629111 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries altogether
6629112 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6629113 we should not have lost we are the best team out there
6629114 we feel the outdoor room and dancing will make sunday a family night that is rich in pictures and entertainment
6629115 we are not programming to win nights or weeks but to create hit shows if we do that the other stuff ratings looks after itself
6629116 there is risk in every move you make its about assessing the size of the risk
6629117 there are going to be a lot of changes this year and i think a new audience will be brought to the show
6629118 more than 200 programs have gone up against 60 minutes over the years some have made our eyes water and no doubt some will in future
6629119 let us not create this mentality them versus us white versus black and rich versus poor that this discussion right now has evolved into
6629120 we know why they dont convict for various reasons but this report glossed over those
6629121 i think theres no question that cumulative life experiences of a typical baltimore city juror is probably going to be different than the life experiences of a howard county juror
6629122 if youre trying to convince a county jury that the police officer lied and is not to be believed its gonna be very hard to get the county jury to do that but in the city juries tend to be more willing to accept an argument like that

6629125 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
6629126 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
6629127 like all privacy matters its something that people need to be informed on
6629128 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
6629129 that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising
6629130 we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing and how they use the information once they do get access to it
6629131 we dont have any raw data on the identifiable individual
6629132 we will not be using this technology again until such time as all the privacy concerns have been addressed
6629133 we are perfectly o k for some of our partners to wait until we have a better more informed education of the public and folks in washington before they resume their rollout
6629134 compliance is becoming very complex and not very clear in terms of what applies to a new and emerging business model
6629135 from the companys perspective of trying to comply with these laws we thought a comprehensive federal privacy law made a lot of sense
6629136 theyre raising these bigger picture questions and those questions are inherently intertwined not just with privacy laws but also with contract law computer intrusion law consumer fraud law
6629137 when legislators are trying to regulate in this area theyre always caught a little bit between a rock and a hard place
6629138 you dont want to adopt a technology specific standard thats destined to fail as technology advances faster than the law can ever hope to embody at the same time you need to allow adequate specificity in the law to allow companies to comply with it and allow consumers to know what their rights are
6629139 theres a self regulatory program out there which hasnt been very effective
6629140 a really welcome development in the absence of any kind of regulation
6629141 the companies dont feel the need to explain everything theyre doing
6629142 so a little bit of pressure from congress or the f t c can go a long way
6629143 people my age in their 20s or in their 30s a lot of them are very clued up on protecting privacy on the internet

6629146 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6629147 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6629148 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6629149 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages

6629167 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6629168 where will social media sites be in five or ten years
6629169 ive been saying all along that she got caught doping when she was scoring 6300 points so how can she not be doping and scoring 6800
6629170 i have not seen any of her heptathlon results since early june and then she comes out here and is producing good performances which was suspicious
6629171 there have been largely two types of critics of the new atheism one type grants the empiricism of the atheists and then tries to show that belief in god is consistent with it this approach gives away the store by removing god from the realm of the knowable the second also grants the atheists empiricism but argues that it leads to the detection of design in the universe and thus the existence of god this approach gives away the store as well by limiting knowledge to the empirically detectable professor feser offers us a third approach one that is far more effective in defeating the new atheism he provides persuasive arguments that show that god is knowable and that what is knowable is larger than the set of that which is empirically detectable this is a tour de force that should be in the library of every thinking citizen believer or unbeliever

6629180 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oils played a role in the collapse that brought the building down
6629181 seven world trade center is one of the key points of evidence one of the smoking guns
6629182 there have been much hotter longer lasting and larger fires in skyscrapers that have not fallen down
6629183 our take home message today is the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6629184 it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
6629185 its clear that cynthia lummis intends on continuing barbara cubins legacy of negative politics and no solutions trying to pit american against american wyomingite against wyomingite is exactly the type of divisive politics that career politicians practice and that takes america on the wrong track
6629186 cynthia lummis didnt appear to disagree with mark gordons policies just his desire to put people before partisan politics a majority of republican primary voters didnt vote for her because the people of wyoming are growing weary of personal attacks and prefer positive solutions
6629187 cynthia lummis campaign tactics appeal to voters worst instincts we are proud to field a candidate in gary trauner who is focusing on issues that matter to wyoming families and who is running a campaign that will make wyomings people proud to call him their congressman
6629188 they just enjoy getting into the party atmosphere on thursday and carrying it right on through

6629193 the reason for this is that i have received since my last term complaints of discourtesy to the riders

6629195 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6629196 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6629197 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6629198 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6629199 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6629200 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
6629201 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6629202 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6629203 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6629204 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone

6629210 quando sofremos o gol tivemos pressa e a eliminamos a perfei o
6629211 o primeiro tempo a equipe se portou bem tivemos a bola a rea est vamos bem distribu dos mas no segundo tempo embolou tudo sempre sobrando um defensor deles depend amos da sorte e futebol n o isso quando sofremos o gol tivemos pressa e a eliminamos a perfei o
6629212 n o sei se n s ganhar amos jogando no canind mas pelo que se viu no jogo hoje
6629213 o vasco joga como bem quiser mas hoje ele se prop s a defender e jogar no contra ataque n s num gramado melhor ser amos muito melhores do que fomos o vasco se beneficiou disso
6629214 a puni o foi marcante para n s n s sentimos isso hoje sentimos falta de um gramado melhor para ter mais condi es de jogo pelo que foi proposto na partida n s atacando e o vasco se defendendo
6629215 a gente sabia da nossa qualidade e poder amos ter sa do com a vit ria mas um ponto no mineir o foi importante
6629216 n o foi por causa da minha paradinha fiz isso pois o goleiro sabe onde eu bato mas ele foi feliz no lance e a bola ainda saiu lenta
6629217 n o porque perdemos esse jogo que temos que vencer no recife temos obriga o de vencer todos os jogos
6629218 temos obriga o de vencer todos os jogos n o porque perdemos esse jogo que temos que vencer no recife
6629219 me agradou a rea o no segundo tempo voltamos a ser um time agrupado as substitui es tiveram efeito mas n o foi suficiente
6629220 sab amos como o flamengo jogaria perdemos o jogo porque n o fomos bem
6629221 deixamos escapar a oportunidade de estar numa situa o melhor
6629222 o flamengo assumiu controle da partida e fez por merecer o placar
6629223 n o tivemos a mesma atitude dos outros jogos o flamengo assumiu controle da partida e fez por merecer o placar
6629224 o gr mio jogou sonolento no primeiro tempo sem a atitude que o caracteriza sempre o gr mio n o sabe jogar administrando o jogo jogando bolinha para o lado
6629225 o gr mio n o foi o time compacto que vinha sendo o primeiro tempo n o foi bom no segundo melhorou um pouquinho com as substitui es feitas mas longe de ser o gr mio que vinha sendo temos que saber disso e assimilar
6629226 a libertadores n o o nosso objetivo a gente quer o t tulo
6629227 valeu a pena insistir nosso time assim joga com muita garra e vontade de vencer dessa maneira que a gente ganha as partidas
6629228 precisamos fazer uma campanha melhor que a do primeiro turno para pensar em t tulo

6629235 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed

6629240 the nigerian high commissioner in australia says people who are ripped off by so called nigerian scams are
6629241 professor olu agbi said there were almost 140 million people in nigeria and fewer than 0 1 per cent were involved

6629246 whats the big deal she did get the cards and some cash
6629247 10 000 pesos you know you can do better than that and we have an idea of what you did with her last night
6629248 now dont try escaping this one with your eh if i remember correctly you made me get miki a shopping spree after your first ehem with her
6629249 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6629250 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night
6629251 i dont believe you i know you yoshiko she smelled like your room
6629252 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6629253 what mai wait a second i thought i was hearing things
6629254 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6629255 we have seen tremendous growth in the casual sports gaming market in the last few years and saw an opportunity that would be a perfect fit for the nintendo wii
6629256 with deca sports we wanted to offer a sports package that is unrivaled in terms of sheer number of available sports more importantly the game is easy to play but offers layers of depth that even hardcore sports enthusiasts will love to play
6629257 the nigerian high commissioner in australia says people who are ripped off by so called nigerian scams are
6629258 professor olu agbi said there were almost 140 million people in nigeria and fewer than 0 1 per cent were involved
6629259 we are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel when we should be using natures inexhaustible sources of energy sun wind and tide id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
6629260 having used ue3 to build grimm and spent considerable time in the past working with ids tools ive followed this story with amazement
6629261 to expect a licensed engine fresh out of the box would require no modification or improvements to achieve development goals on a new title is ludicrous
6629262 but to build an entirely new engine as an alternative to improving an existing one sounds a bit unreasonable and to build that new engine inside 1 year then ship a title with it now things are starting to sound surreal
6629263 alles getan die trennung zwischen ost und west zu berwinden
6629264 to get the right things to the right place at the right time the first time while minimizing waste and being open to change

6629267 i never crossed martin oneill i was fined for saying that i didnt understand why they had got scott carson in
6629268 now i know it all came as a big surprise and i expressed my surprise the manager took it very personally hes the manager he makes the decisions i will try my best to prove him wrong
6629269 i have a chance now to prove to myself and everyone else that he was wrong
6629270 you watch tape on him and you get a feel for him but to see the way he practices
6629271 he practices extremely hard and he carries it over to the game and he plays very fast
6629272 hes not a prima donna hes not a guy who feels like ive got to be treated a certain way and that makes my job a lot easier and it makes coach
6629273 when one of your best players is a guy who buys into what youre trying to get accomplished youve got a chance and hes been exceptional
6629274 injuries as you know are the thing that you cant predict
6629275 but based on the way he plays now and the way he prepares because hes not a guy whos just physically talented he really works on the game from a mental standpoint as well watching tape studying opponents talking to other players in the league about offensive lineman and what they like to do and what their weaknesses are hes a student of the game and with his athletic ability the skys the limit
6629276 were happy were sad i mean hearing what actually happened is really heartbreaking but were really glad that hes finally brought to justice and david can finally rest
6629277 there are many reasons an organization would want to move toward biodiesel including environmental benefits and reducing consumption of imported petroleum
6629278 we also saw a significant benefit to using the diesel electric hybrid buses so we would recommend increasing the number of hybrids in the fleet the best bang for your buck might be running b20 in hybrid buses depending on the initial cost of hybrids compared to standard buses
6629279 changing to b20 could potentially save indygo 360 000 gallons of fuel per year in foreign and non renewable sources
6629280 that equates to 770 000 gallons of crude oil needed to produce the fuel
6629281 biodiesel is more environmentally friendly than standard diesel 100 percent renewable and domestically available
6629282 it can be made from different types of animal fats and oils from plants including soybeans
6629283 if you switched over completely to biodiesel you would see about a 50 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions which is pretty substantial
6629284 it is a concern and its one of the things we are working on in our research team for blends higher than 20 percent
6629285 it is also important that our students get plenty of rest each night and understand that school is a place of learning and development and that inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated parents i ask that you have conversations with your child about what is expected of him or her when they are in school in the community and at home

6629292 based on the discussions held at our joint workshop with the national renewable energy laboratory on power engineering needs for the wind industry this spring there are a number of steps that organizations can take to help strengthen the workforce in this area and support of students in their education is a critical one the uwig board recognized this issue and took this step to help address an important need for the industry which we feel will become only more important as time goes on

6629300 the demographic divide the inequality in the population and health profiles of rich and poor countries is widening
6629301 we will likely see the 7 billion mark passed within four years
6629302 and by 2050 global population is projected to rise to 9 3 billion between now and mid century these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in todays less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent

6629308 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window
6629309 we suspect that the pigeon carried the drugs from tuzla
6629310 we do not know what to do with the pigeon but for the time being it will remain behind bars
6629311 i always have a hard time nominating people for these things but this award seems to be fairly new so i have some long time friends i can nominate for this
6629312 would not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area
6629313 the commissions examination of the proposed transaction showed that the horizontal overlaps between the activities of kenwood and jvc are limited in most markets that the new entity would continue to face several significant competitors in the markets for car electronics home electronics and mobile electronics and that customers would continue to have access to a sufficient number of alternative suppliers
6629314 in recent years the consumer electronics industry has witnessed the appearance of new rivals in such countries as south korea taiwan and china and increasingly fierce battles over market share and heightened price competition in the global market
6629315 you literally could make an object of any imaginable shape or design an object of any imaginable shape and simply hit the print command and the matter would take that shape
6629316 the late arthur c clarke famed british author and inventor had this wonderful quote any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic and thats what programmable matter is its a technology so advanced it might as well be magic
6629317 and well go from millimeters to microns i guess some time over the next five to 10 years
6629318 the programming questions are even more profound people are larrabee comes out several dozens of cores
6629319 how would you program a million or a billion pieces of programmable matter what does programming even mean
6629320 wouldnt it be nice some time in the future if we can get rid of the cords you wouldnt have a battery in the sense you do now
6629321 as you move into these fields youd very quickly power up your device literally in a matter of seconds and itd be good for several hours of operation with the idea that some time in the next several hours youd find another wireless power source
6629322 theyll be built into the tables or into the walls and they will just keep you going
6629323 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field
6629324 were doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce its incidence
6629325 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
6629326 indicating that the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in coming weeks
6629327 the most important thing for people to patch are the name servers that back up their mail servers
6629328 the good news is that there are hundreds of millions of users protected against these attacks the bad news is its not everybody
6629329 one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals
6629330 while the size of venture deals in the united states europe and even china continues to climb venture capitalists have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region
6629331 the level of interest has been great and many big companies are looking to take advantage of the development
6629332 we had a grannies group too and registered participants as young as one this year so age is definitely no barrier
6629333 the important thing is to get as many people participating and fundraising as possible it doesnt matter how long they walk for
6629334 the walk can be broken up into shifts amongst groups too so that one person can do say 4pm to 8pm and then go home and someone else in the team does the next and so on
6629335 some people have the thought that because cancer council is a nation wide charity that the funds dont help local people but because we are in a rural area patients have to travel to newcastle and often sydney for treatment and appointments
6629336 it is more important for rural areas that these phone and internet support services are kept accessible because we are so far from the city
6629337 we need as many people as possible to get involved and if they arent in a group individual registrations can be taken
6629338 that is very common too as we have repeat walkers who originally got involved because of more distant connections but sadly over time more people are finding themselves walking for a friend or relative
6629339 its a sad time but also a proud moment to see the community come together and support one another
6629340 its amazing to see some of the walkers from the first lap stick around and do their best to help others get through their next battle
6629341 the atmosphere is amazing on the night as groups mingle and share a coffee at each others tents it makes for a great support network while raising money at the same time
6629342 its very different to come here as a teacher not a student
6629343 i really enjoyed the teaching experience and playing at recess and lunch with all the students
6629344 theres just not enough time to wait for the licence to come through and put a plan in place and get everybody trained and ready to go
6629345 while it is disappointing it gives us more time to plan this properly
6629346 we will look to do our volunteer recruitment training and community consultation over the next few months and hit the ground running in the new year confident in what we are doing
6629347 i dont think they flying foxes will cause us any significant problems
6629348 burdekin park is more important than the couple of acres of our property
6629349 if i could stop just one person from taking drugs that would be overwhelming but if i could change the lives of hundreds that would be such a brilliant feeling
6629350 kids think that they are bulletproof and that they need drugs or alcohol to have fun which is a theory i hope to help demolish
6629351 the towns have been so friendly and i have met so many amazing people
6629352 but i miss my mum so much sometimes i cry but i try to stay strong
6629353 im definitely looking forward to seeing my family and friends again and sleeping in a bed again
6629354 we had missed some of the factors at that time
6629355 the first should be the security concerns i made the budget before the sept 11 2001 terror attack in the united states and thus did not give much consideration to the non conventional security factors
6629356 the second is that we underestimated the change of currency exchange rate and prices the third is the high tech investment we did not expect the lcd screen tvs cost so much
6629357 we used to be very conservative we thought revenue of more than 1billion u s dollars was a bold forecast which has been proved wrong
6629358 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6629359 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6629360 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6629361 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6629362 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6629363 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6629364 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6629365 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6629366 the program is about trying to encourage students to participate not to see who is the best
6629367 the olympic and paralympic games inspire people of all backgrounds
6629368 it captivates childrens imagination by watching thinking and talking about sport and motivates them to get out there and be active
6629369 the children in the aasc program have been inspired to cover as much distance as possible
6629370 it is wonderful that we can take world events like the olympics and paralympics and use it to motivate children to get active and encourage fair play and teamwork
6629371 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6629372 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6629373 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6629374 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6629375 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6629376 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6629377 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6629378 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6629379 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6629380 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6629381 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6629382 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6629383 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6629384 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6629385 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6629386 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6629387 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6629388 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6629389 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6629390 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6629391 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6629392 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6629393 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6629394 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6629395 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6629396 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6629397 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6629398 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6629399 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6629400 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6629401 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6629402 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6629403 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6629404 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
6629405 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6629406 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6629407 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6629408 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6629409 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6629410 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6629411 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6629412 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6629413 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6629414 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6629415 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6629416 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6629417 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6629418 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6629419 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6629420 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6629421 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6629422 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6629423 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6629424 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6629425 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6629426 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6629427 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6629428 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6629429 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6629430 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6629431 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6629432 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6629433 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6629434 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6629435 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6629436 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6629437 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6629438 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6629439 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6629440 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6629441 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6629442 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6629443 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6629444 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6629445 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6629446 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6629447 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6629448 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6629449 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6629450 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6629451 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6629452 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6629453 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6629454 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6629455 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6629456 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6629457 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6629458 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6629459 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6629460 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6629461 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6629462 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6629463 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6629464 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6629465 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6629466 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6629467 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6629468 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6629469 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6629470 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree of certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
6629471 hoje tudo deu certo estou muito feliz em levar esta medalha para o brasil agora quero curtir o bronze quero voltar para casa para curtir o meu filho a leila ex jogadora da sele o de quadra e os meus pais quero passar para eles um pouco dessa emo o

6629473 key stage 3 is a critical time to build on pupils skills and plan for post 14 continuity and improved uptake of languages
6629474 from the knee to the ankle area covered in bites
6629475 i didnt really feel anything bothering me while eating i woke up the next day and noticed i had bumps all over my legs
6629476 sharon and i spoke on monday and by happenstance figured out we were at the same place
6629477 i didnt feel anything until late in the night early the next morning the next day and i had what i would think of as an infestation of bites from the knees down
6629478 quite frankly i have gotten mosquito bites in the past and this was nothing like that
6629479 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it

6629482 were looking for common ground and the prime minister will make a determination after those meetings based on those discussions
6629483 only one person can make that decision and its the prime minister were not ruling anything in or anything out at this point
6629484 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6629485 its right wing ideology that goes against quebec values and destroys everything in its wake
6629486 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6629487 everything went well it was awesome its my longest flight with this wing
6629488 if there are no technical problems its ok for the english channel i cant wait for this next challenge
6629489 dry clean or handwash in soapflakes do not soak cool rinse do not wring short spin do not leave wet reshape and dry flat away from direct sunlight use damp pressing cloth
6629490 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6629491 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6629492 my people decide the truth in sixty countries every morning and in every one its different
6629493 its at a great time because its at christmas and everyones off for us to have any of these games at niagara would be unbelievable
6629494 it will be a real treat for sports fans in our country to have the world junior championship back in the united states
6629495 its a very special event with an extremely high level of talent
6629496 said laura maccleery deputy director of the democracy program at the brennan center for justice
6629497 moving to l a was cool but the traffic was crazy
6629498 it was an easy transition im staying out at newport coast its pretty nice out there coming out here everybody had everything laid out for me pretty easy they had the restaurants down they had the cleaners down they had everything down
6629499 im comfortable here and im starting to fit in i love my teammates over here
6629500 but sometimes its hard i was sleeping today thinking we are playing minnesota the team i grew up with at the same time its not the same as opening day its totally different
6629501 they just kept sending him down telling him he wasnt ready he knew he was ready but its all about being patient i told him to be patient and your turn will come once you get it dont let it slide or slip away he got up and right away made an impact for the team
6629502 i knew they played the game the right way and they were going to compete
6629503 everybody knew that in that division every team you go over there and they will tell you the minnesota twins are tough they play the game the right way
6629504 he just came to play every day guys like that who get it done are your leaders play the game the way we like to see if played hard everyday with a smile thats what he was for us we know there are changes and everything but that was a big hole created you dont replace torii we just get another center fielder
6629505 they call him loose cannon i heard but that talent he has is unbelievable speed arm and hes going to hit hes 22 years old i remember when i was 22 23 i was still learning how to hit i definitely think if you be patient with him hes smart enough to go out there and learn as much as he can i think hes going to be a big impact in the organization
6629506 i want them to make it to the postseason because i have a lot of respect for the organization i want those guys to make it there and go on
6629507 hes going to take some time off get some treatment and its possible hell pitch again in a couple weeks thats kind of what were hoping for
6629508 its hard to say if it was related to the surgery
6629509 seans going to just shut it down take some time off so theres nothing really going on
6629510 just the shoulder fatigue the way it was diagnosed just take some time off
6629511 obviously you have to look at each one of the injuries individually
6629512 this way theyll be able to come to the clinic for minor issues
6629513 you will not find the typical clientele that would frequent a community health center
6629514 were very perplexed on why the taxpayers are footing an 18 million purchase of land and property when the need there in north austin does not exist
6629515 60 percent of the patients who utilize our clinic today are located in this braker area
6629516 we are very open and very willing to talk to the community about how we can make the clinic a better partner and neighbor
6629517 we are talking about a driving qualification taking place in schools and colleges to prepare people for driving and the whole issue of road safety
6629518 were talking about completely revamping the testing procedure which has pretty much remained the same since the 1940s
6629519 we are still killing eight people a day in this country
6629520 if you saw that happen in aviation or on the railway it would be major news headlines for days even weeks
6629521 because were talking about individual instances across the country these figures dont feature very often in the media
6629522 but for the families and friends of those who are killed or seriously injured and were talking about 30 000 of those as well these are major incidents and major tragedies so weve got to work very hard to get them down
6629523 we want the government to encourage them to carry on their driver education beyond the l test to start earlier and go beyond the l test as well
6629524 the question is what happens after youve passed youre driving test
6629525 thats where we think more could be done in that crucial six months those first solo hours when you really learn to drive
6629526 you dont have an instructor and you may not have a parent with you
6629527 thats where you find out all the distractions that younger drivers have to face
6629528 ah non jai vu un chat noir aujourdhui donc cest mieux de commander demain
6629529 ah non je me suis lev e du pied gauche ce matin donc cest mieux de commander demain
6629530 ah non il pleut aujourdhui donc cest mieux de commander demain
6629531 ah faudrait que je v rifie si mon passeport est valable pour les states et voir si jai pas besoin dun visa car je sais plus si mon passeport est optique biom trique ou transg nique
6629532 la decisi n es no enviar carne a la paz y su vecina el alto porque apoyamos la demanda regional para que se devuelvan los recursos del idh
6629533 a partir de hoy se suspender a el env o de carne a la paz oruro y potos es una medida indefinida
6629534 entre las estrategias de beni pando y santa cruz est no enviar alimentos destinados al consumo entre esas decisiones est el producto carne
6629535 va a haber otras medidas a partir de ma ana pero guerra anunciada no mata a nadie
6629536 estamos listos para hacer una intervenci n sea con carne boliviana o sea de afuera
6629537 hay sectores productores que no act an con racionalidad econ mica sino pol tica hasta ahora son amenazas y esperamos que no se consoliden vamos a evaluar y luego veremos qu medidas tomamos
6629538 si ellos no abastecen al mercado nacional y no pueden abastecer las exportaciones les deseamos felices sue os al lado de sus vacas
6629539 si quieren que no nos vendan se puede importar carne de argentina uruguay o per
6629540 method but if half of that time is spent writing some
6629541 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6629542 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6629543 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6629544 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6629545 the state of texas and others have recognized we do not have time sometimes to go through a full competitive bidding process on all energy processes
6629546 sometimes by the time you begin a bidding process the price cant hold until the end of the bidding process
6629547 is actually 800 million dollars more than the bids that we have recently put out
6629548 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6629549 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6629550 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6629551 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6629552 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic
6629553 these concerns are legitimate and need to be heard and respected we strongly support we have to learn from the past
6629554 without quick and robust investment in securing forest community rights these carbon markets will further marginalise the poorest of the poor
6629555 even the world bank is saying that this is the social justice issue of our generation
6629556 en primer lugar la funci n de jefe de estado en segundo lugar la funci n de l der de un proceso revolucionario esto es de una etapa hist rica de cambios estructurales y en tercer lugar la funci n de presidente de gobierno
6629557 muchos graves problemas siguen sin soluci n debemos hacer caer todo el peso de la autocr tica sobre nosotros primero que nada sobre m como jefe de gobierno sobre mi gabinete sobre los ministros las ministras el vicepresidente sobre los gobiernos regionales sobre los gobiernos locales se ores gobernadores se ores alcaldes sobre los terribles fen menos que siguen siendo la burocratizaci n la ineficiencia y la corrupci n que hace tanto da o como un c ncer en un cuerpo humano y que son amenaza verdadera
6629558 hay preguntas que la gente se hace todos los d as y que nosotros debemos hacernos todos los d as por qu desapareci la leche
6629559 presidente estoy indignado no s para donde voy ni como llegar all no entiendo bien para que son las lucecitas del tablero que me tienen mareado este avi n parece tener tres alas ala izquierda ala derech y a la mierda
6629560 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay
6629561 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6629562 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6629563 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6629564 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6629565 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6629566 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6629567 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6629568 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6629569 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6629570 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6629571 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6629572 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6629573 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6629574 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6629575 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6629576 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6629577 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6629578 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6629579 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6629580 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6629581 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6629582 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera

6629584 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6629585 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6629586 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6629587 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6629588 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6629589 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6629590 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6629591 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6629592 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6629593 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6629594 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6629595 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

6629597 were working on a very compressed schedule to complete the film but its very exciting
6629598 its really fun but i wish i didnt have this movie distracting me from writing comic books
6629599 i never tried my hand at this before obviously and its really nice actually
6629600 back then i was so completely consumed by the television series
6629601 i barely had time to read the comics let alone write one so this is a real pleasure i still dont have that much time but i have more time then when i was doing the series
6629602 i know i am not the first person nor the last person to say this but comics is so different than doing television or a movie because you dont have to go through all of the layers
6629603 its just you and your editor its very pure and it keeps you connected to what you love about the process instead having to deal with all of the politics that inevitably surround filmmaking
6629604 we were talking about re launching x files as a comic book series or a graphic novel series and the people at fox were trying to figure out what to do and i just said i am going to call some of my friends and see what they think
6629605 so i actually contacted wildstorm and said hey do you guys want to do x files and they said yes i actually thought there would be some corporate conflict because they are part of dc which is part of time warner and we are a part of 20th century fox which is part of news corp and i didnt know if these corporations got along but it ended up not being a problem and its been great
6629606 my thought was that it made more sense to set the comic series in i hate to use the word but the classic period of the x files
6629607 mulder and scully are both still at the f b i working in mulders basement office the lone gunmen are around skinner is around its the heart of what everybody knows and loves about the x files
6629608 it would just be too difficult to address how fluid the world of the x files is at this time so it just made easier to set it in the past
6629609 its in classic x files mode mulder the believer scully the sceptic and scary
6629610 its simpler than an episode would be because its shorter than the length of an episode
6629611 its like revisiting holmes and watson when they were at the peak of their adventures as well
6629612 its being very precise with dialogue saying less and showing more which i love to do
6629613 there is a reason why comic books translate so well to the big screen its because they are cinematic and its telling stories with pictures instead of words and i love that the challenge is saying things so succinctly that they fit you dont have tons and tons of dialogue i have to say it hasnt been painful at all its been really enjoyable its just finding the time to do it
6629614 its so beautiful i was just blown away when i saw the first couple of pages that hed done
6629615 they came to me as a file on my computer and i just opened them up and it was like my god this is gorgeous i just cant wait to see it in print
6629616 the idea now is to make stand alone specials but the next ones that i am going to write tie into the mythology of the show not in a way that changes the path but deepens it a little bit
6629617 as my time allows and then bring in other writers to do them thats my hope that we can make this a vital enterprise
6629618 id be thrilled if they would come on to write a special i havent asked them yet but id be delighted if both of them would theyd be awesome and i am going to make some calls to old x files compatriots too and see if i can rope any of them in as well
6629619 dedicated to michael turner comic book artist visionary and the bravest man ive ever known
6629620 the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long and you have burned so very very brightly mike
6629621 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6629622 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6629623 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6629624 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6629625 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6629626 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6629627 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6629628 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6629629 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6629630 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6629631 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6629632 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities
6629633 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6629634 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6629635 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low
6629636 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6629637 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6629638 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6629639 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6629640 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6629641 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6629642 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6629643 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6629644 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6629645 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6629646 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
6629647 it was a combination of things and they all came together to cause the move we saw today
6629648 speculators are in the drivers seat and theyre driving our economy right over the cliff
6629649 is going to hit the u s consumer squarely in the wallet in a day or two
6629650 this russian thing is significant if in fact they dont leave
6629651 by occupying the country the operators of those pipeline facilities may choose not to operate them because the risk is too high

6629654 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6629655 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6629656 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6629657 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6629658 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6629659 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6629660 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6629661 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6629662 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6629663 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6629664 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6629665 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6629666 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6629667 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6629668 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6629669 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6629670 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6629671 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6629672 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6629673 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6629674 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6629675 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6629676 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6629677 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6629678 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n

6629952 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6629953 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6629954 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6629955 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6629956 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items

6629988 we had lots of difficulty selecting players most of the young players preferred indoor training facilities for beach volleyball were very rough
