7870001 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause
7870002 but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7870003 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver i understand some folks may not like that but you know im a job applicant

7870007 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7870008 the work ahead is to get that verification mechanism and therefore to proceed with denuclearization
7870009 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7870010 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying
7870011 i hope north korea will resume disablement measures at an early date
7870012 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7870013 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more
7870014 im very comfortable with our young prospects coming here and doing it the way nick evans has done it i feel comfortable internally that well find a way to get it done
7870015 weve all seen john maine even without his best stuff if im not mistaken he had a pretty good game in pittsburgh
7870016 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7870017 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7870018 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible

7870064 under mayor daleys leadership the business community had effectively one stop shopping in city hall
7870065 members of chicagos city council were relatively complacent until recently
7870066 we never want to go to war but were preparing for a war if that has to take place
7870067 we have a great pro business mayor but we havent backed him up where we should help the mayor is to help him have an enlightened council

7870085 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7870086 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7870087 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7870088 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7870089 notable increase in the number of cases of ill treatment by security forces
7870090 i think there are two obstacles one of process and another of will
7870091 for example we know of cases in the police where an officer has been recommended for suspension but the suspension has not been executed
7870092 but it has been a significant amount of time already and we feel that it is legitimate now to ask for results and we have not yet seen those results
7870093 people currently remain in prison but have not had any follow up with their cases
7870094 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation i dont think isolation is looming
7870095 the black box is intact and the pilot is alive so i think we will find out the actual reason for this tragedy soon
7870096 the situation is worsened by the fact that kyrgyzstan does not have the necessary equipment
7870097 the country might have turned the corner the situation has finally started to improve
7870098 but whether this is a long term permanent reduction the answer is hard to say the situation is vulnerable to a relapse
7870099 this geographical overlap between regions of opium and zones of insurgency shows the inextricable link between drugs and conflict
7870100 since drugs and insurgency are caused by and effect each other they need to be dealt with at the same time and urgently
7870101 the reduction this year that were seeing overall we think is probably largely due to the weather the climate and economics
7870102 the economic foundations of the opium economy have finally been undermined
7870103 judging from the fact that there are now 18 opium free provinces a growing number of governors are really playing by the rule book
7870104 generally speaking it takes 12 25 years a generation to wipe out opium cultivation in a country
7870105 its a more complex problem we are fighting enemies who are at our side
7870106 the problems with traffickers are not new but now the militias have come and they are a grave issue for brazils democracy
7870107 when militias started to grow they said good this is how to defend against drug traffic
7870108 basically we are still just looking for information including the whereabouts of the person
7870109 the situation is quite messy and there is a heavy influx of displaced families in the transit camps
7870110 emergency shelter continues to be one of the greatest needs at present it may be required for 3 4 months many of the shelters are still overcrowded and there is a shortage of adequate sleeping mats especially for children private areas separated areas bathrooms for women and toilet facilities
7870111 until now not even half of the affected families have come for aid as they are living with relatives and trying to cope but gradually more victims are now approaching us for help and their numbers are growing
7870112 we are concerned about the maternal health of expectant mothers and the health of the infants who have special needs

7870115 we landed on the one that we think is best for our brand our business our customers and our associates
7870116 any time a function like marketing wants to spend money against an association and property whether its other sports or nascar you need to have the right rationale
7870117 in our case we can show why this makes sense for the home depot we fell very good about our participation in the sport
7870118 we think it helps us better connect with our customers and we know it inspires and excites our associates
7870119 we always take into consideration competitive factors but that wasnt an overwhelming consideration
7870120 we were trying to do what we felt was best for our brand and business and customers thats what drove our decision also based on the success weve had in this sport
7870121 was it a consideration that our competitors were in the sport yeah but not a controlling one or driving one by any stretch of the imagination
7870122 as the awareness builds and hes competitive youll take the fan that has a propensity to want to follow the home depot and shop in our stores were convinced the loyalty will be there and will grow over time
7870123 we totally acknowledge that when you look at the nascar fan base that point of consumer passion is the driver
7870124 they certainly acknowledge the race team but at the same time they really connect with the driver tony has his followings without a doubt but at the same time were totally convinced and excited about what joey represents and we feel he is going to appeal to a broad swath of our customer base 18 to 54 we dont see any downside to that
7870125 i dont like the notion of joey as the kid
7870126 i think what we see in joey is a mature young man who has the values the work ethic and the competence if you look at what joeys done already behind the wheel of a car it gives us comfort going forward

7870141 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked

7870146 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke
7870147 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work

7870149 everyone says not to go to the ale house lame park slope people so so food its just not what you think it will be
7870150 im not listening to everyone ever again who is everyone anyway and what do they know
7870151 the it resources in businesses today are stretched very thin and running a stable replication system still remains a complex process
7870152 many it departments dont perform periodic role swaps and dont correct errors as often as they should our managed services offering takes the guesswork out of running high availability and its price point makes it an affordable option for companies looking for an immediate return on their investment

7870156 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7870157 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7870158 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7870159 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7870160 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7870161 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7870162 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7870163 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7870164 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7870166 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7870167 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7870168 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7870169 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7870170 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7870171 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7870172 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7870173 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7870174 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7870175 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7870176 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7870177 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7870178 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7870179 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7870180 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7870181 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7870182 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7870183 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7870184 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7870185 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7870186 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7870187 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7870188 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7870189 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7870190 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7870191 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7870192 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7870193 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7870194 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7870195 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

7870204 data centers will soon be hit with a perfect storm in terms of coal and natural gas driven utility cost increases coupled with the new carbon caps these sites already have energy densities that are ten times greater than that of commercial office buildings and their energy use is doubling every four years the combination of rising energy usage coupled with significant electricity price increases and carbon caps creates a very troubling picture for data centers companies need a complete solution to deal with this pending crisis and that is exactly what we provide weve taken a comprehensive approach to the issue giving data center owners and users the ability to set energy budgets and the tools to manage their energy efficiency over both the short and long term thats the only way to take control of this rapidly accelerating problem
7870205 the legends poll is far more credible than the bcs bowl championship series poll member coaches watch game dvds each week and get together via conference call to review previous and upcoming games we vote for the top 25 teams based on personal observations of the games and the knowledge shared on our call
7870206 radio is all about great storytelling and we cant think of a more fascinating better informed group
7870207 having the legends coaches as regular contributors to sporting news radio elevates the quality of our content and underscores the unique way we connect with fans
7870208 the legends poll provides a valuable perspective for our readers and listeners we like the idea of being able to complement our thorough coverage of college football with the observations and opinions of these legendary iconic coaches

7870222 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7870223 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7870224 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7870225 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7870226 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7870227 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7870228 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7870229 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7870230 we expect the number of downgrades to exceed upgrades for the rest of 2008 and probably in 2009 as business and financial challenges squeeze operating margins and weaken balance sheets
7870231 much of the operating pressure on the industry that we first observed in the fiscal year 2006 medians has continued into 2007 and we expect these pressures to continue in the next fiscal year especially given the materially weaker economy
7870232 dus voor de volgende aanvraag moeten we onze kansen vergroten door met een breder plan te komen bijvoorbeeld door in de cr che ook educatie aan te bieden
7870233 cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0 1 percent to global gdp
7870234 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7870235 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7870236 we put bear lake cutthroats in strawberry reservoir after we treated the reservoir in 1990 the cutthroats in strawberry have been protected by a limit thats similar to the one were proposing for scofield
7870237 the cutthroats have kept the chub populations in strawberry in check we hope theyll do the same thing in scofield
7870238 the information we gain will help us control chub populations better in other areas of the state
7870239 theyre not an attractive fish but burbot are a great fish to eat
7870240 this proposal would give anglers a chance to help the fishery and take more burbot home to eat
7870241 cutthroat and tiger trout start eating chubs when they reach about 17 inches in length by the time they reach 20 inches theyre excellent predators
7870242 we removed all of the chubs in the reservoir in 2006 even if we allow anglers to keep one cutthroat or tiger trout between 15 and 22 inches long we think there will still be enough of them in the reservoir to keep the reservoirs chub population in check
7870243 were fairly confident that we have found some muskies that are disease free

7870259 erinnert mich von der grundidee etwas an den milk desk
7870260 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england
7870261 my manager has told me that i am not going for trials but for medical tests and if i pass i will be playing for fulham this season
7870262 david wants to stay with us and we want to keep him
7870263 hes had a short discussion with the manager and when the transfer window closes im sure well sort it out
7870264 i am very disappointed with the current situation considering just how ill i have been
7870265 they stopped my wages two weeks ago saying that i was unable to play and that i was not essential
7870266 i am training on my own in england working on a club programme designed to get me back playing again before the end of the season
7870267 right now i feel like a few other players at cork that have been marginalised
7870268 i am still under contract to the end of the season and i have been lucky to be part of a great dressing room in cork and i have a great affinity with the lads
7870269 this is a difficult situation for everybody at the club
7870270 we have to wait and see if we get him over on time
7870271 the good thing is that he has been playing regularly and travelling around the world regularly with the us national team
7870272 when i first met him he came across as one of these boys who would not be fazed by a great deal
7870273 he seems quite a confident lad if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage
7870274 dad why are the police chasing after batman he didnt do anything

7870282 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7870283 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7870284 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7870285 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7870286 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7870287 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7870288 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7870289 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7870290 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7870291 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7870292 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7870293 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
7870294 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
7870295 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
7870296 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
7870297 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks

7870299 thats the third night in a row that toms friend has crashed on our couch

7870301 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7870302 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7870303 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7870304 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7870305 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7870306 marc siegel is an articulate voice of reason in a world beset by hype and hysteria we would be well advised to listen closely to what he has to say
7870307 siegel cuts through the hype about the deadly this and the lethal that and applies reason in seeking the answers
7870308 prescription medication borrowing and sharing among women of reproductive age
7870309 it is clear that patients need to be counseled about the potential risks of sharing and borrowing medications especially if they are women of reproductive age
7870310 we made several improvements in the technique that could allow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
7870311 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
7870312 for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
7870313 i think this is going to be a big advance for having to remove the entire kidney because of large kidney tumors this could be a great improvement over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
7870314 the robotic instruments are like having my hands inside the body
7870315 we are blessed to have each other to depend on if you have to go through something bad like cancer youre glad to have a friend to go through it with
7870316 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7870317 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7870318 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7870319 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7870320 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7870321 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7870322 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7870323 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7870324 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7870325 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7870326 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7870327 hospice and palliative medicine is a newly recognized medical subspecialty
7870328 this unique specialty reflects the need for specialized medical care for the growing number of older adults and persons with serious complex and chronic illnesses which currently pose an enormous challenge to the healthcare industry
7870329 there is a much greater demand than supply of physicians skilled in hospice and palliative medicine
7870330 well trained physicians in this field have unlimited opportunities aahpm is steadily expanding educational opportunities so that physicians who want to move into hospice and palliative medicine have more learning opportunities
7870331 the unipac book series helps to form a strong foundation for developing these skills
7870332 like good textbooks the unipac booklets have multiple contributors and have been peer reviewed by the leaders in the field
7870333 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
7870334 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
7870335 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
7870336 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7870337 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
7870338 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
7870339 the economy isnt a bunch of rather dull statistics with names like gdp gross domestic product
7870340 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
7870341 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
7870342 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7870343 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7870344 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7870345 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7870346 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7870347 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7870348 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short
7870349 these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumors and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test
7870350 if erbb2 is the accelerator that makes the car move brk helps shift the gear to gain more speed
7870351 we might need to hit erbb2 expressing cancers with drugs against both erbb2 and brk
7870352 brk does not promote the proliferation of normal cells and its expression in normal tissues is restricted to non proliferating cells
7870353 produce fewer unwanted side effects than targeting other cancer promoting proteins
7870354 the middle place is about calling home instinctively even when all the paperwork a marriage license a notarized deed two birth certificates and seven years of tax returns clearly indicates youre an adult but all the same there you are clutching the phone and thanking god that youre still somebodys daughter
7870355 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7870356 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7870357 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7870358 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7870359 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7870360 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7870361 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7870362 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status

7870379 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7870380 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7870381 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7870382 si caratterizza per una maggiore dispersione scolastica e una pi elevata incidenza di giovani con scarse competenze
7870383 lefficacia del sistema scolastico non dipenderebbe dal numero dei docenti impiegati ma dalla loro composizione
7870384 una minore percentuale di docenti a tempo determinato contribuirebbe a ridurre il rischio di dispersione
7870385 nelle regioni meridionali si legge nel documento le percentuali di edifici impropriamente adattati a uso scolastico e di scuole con infrastrutture e impianti igienico sanitari scadenti sono superiori a quelle del centro nord
7870386 possono sia influenzare negativamente gli apprendimenti degli studenti sia segnalare una minore attenzione degli enti locali nei confronti del mondo della scuola

7870424 we expect the number of downgrades to exceed upgrades for the rest of 2008 and probably in 2009 as business and financial challenges squeeze operating margins and weaken balance sheets
7870425 much of the operating pressure on the industry that we first observed in the fiscal year 2006 medians has continued into 2007 and we expect these pressures to continue in the next fiscal year especially given the materially weaker economy

7870441 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
7870442 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

7870445 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
7870446 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

7870479 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7870480 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7870481 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7870482 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7870483 dont eat the green parts of tomatoes cut the green off the potatoes
7870484 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7870485 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7870486 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7870487 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7870488 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7870489 obviously we should all be exercising to get our hearts pumping fast which increases blood flow force through our vessels
7870490 beyond that genetic engineers may in the future design gene therapy that delivers genes only into cells at blood vessel branch points to increase pecam 1 signaling alternatively drug designers might create super active fyn amplifying the signaling effects of pecam 1 phosphorylation to protect vulnerable areas of blood vessels from inflammation
7870491 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7870492 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7870493 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7870494 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7870495 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7870496 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance

7870504 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7870505 determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7870506 all of us driven by the simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7870507 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7870508 in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
7870509 because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation its a belief barack shares a belief at the heart of his lifes work

7870515 its a very unpleasant situation we are sending 170 million dollars away from aisd to the state think about what we could do with that money school finance laws dont allow us to keep it we really have little option
7870516 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7870517 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7870518 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7870519 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7870520 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7870521 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7870522 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals

7870530 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7870531 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7870532 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7870533 without question wholesome the paleo diet for athletes a nutritional formula for peak athletic performance
7870534 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience
7870535 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7870536 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7870537 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7870538 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7870539 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7870540 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7870541 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7870542 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways

7870558 kemudian ditiuplah sangkakala dimana tidak seorangpun tersisa kecuali semuanya akan dibinasakan lalu allah swt menurunkan hujan seperti embun atau bayang bayang lalu tumbuhlah jasad manusia kemudian sangkakala yang kedua ditiup kembali dan manusia pun bermunculan bangkit dan berdiri
7870559 pada hari ketika mereka dibangkitkan allah semuanya lalu diberitakannya kepada mereka apa yang telah mereka kerjakan allah mengumpulkan mencatat perbuatan itu padahal mereka telah melupakannya dan allah maha menyaksikan segala sesuatu
7870560 yaitu pada hari ketika bumi diganti dengan bumi yang lain dan demikian pula langit dan mereka semuanya di padang mahsyar berkumpul menghadap ke hadirat allah yang maha esa lagi maha perkasa
7870561 malaikat malaikat dan jibril naik menghadap kepada rabb dalam sehari yang kadarnya 50 000 tahun qs al maarij 4
7870562 dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat bersumpahlah orang orang yang berdosa bahwa mereka tidak berdiam dalam kubur melainkan sesaat saja

7870577 last week the bush administration issued regulations that directly counter the democratic platforms renewed commitment to ensuring access to family planning services this new policy could obstruct access to care by expanding the power of individuals to refuse to provide even the most basic information counseling and referral for important health care services our members family planning service providers across the country work to ensure access to counseling comprehensive sex education contraception and preventive health services now we must continue to work together to stop this most recent attempt to take away the essential services people need to act responsibly and plan for strong families secretary leavitt and the bush administration know that federal law already prohibits the use of taxpayer money to fund abortion and that there are already laws that protect health care workers federal law has for years carefully balanced protections for individual religious liberty and patients access to family planning services the vast majority of americans who rely on contraception for family planning will see this as an unconscionable injection of ideology into accepted medical best practices

7870590 taxpayers usually cant write off the full market value of a vehicle they donate to charity but many taxpayers dont realize that the federal rules changed in 2005
7870591 taxpayers have to meet strict irs requirements in order to claim more than a 500 deduction
7870592 they dont have a high resale value and the charities dont get much money for them
7870593 its a good idea to check with the charity to find out its plans for the vehicle before you donate it so youll know whether a fair market value deduction is possible
7870594 dont forget to get the necessary paperwork to substantiate the deduction
7870595 get extra mileage out of the deduction by making a bigger down payment on a new car or by putting the money in your automobile repair fund
7870596 youll have reduced the overall cost of financing the new car or saved some money for future costs
7870597 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
7870598 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving its far too early to know how all these effects together will influence insurance claim costs
7870599 the low car diet demonstrates that car sharing is an effective way to reduce individual car ownership vehicle miles traveled and make urban living more affordable
7870600 we envision cities where there are more car sharers than car owners when this happens millions of urban residents will be contributing to a cleaner environment by making smart transportation choices that benefit them and their communities

7870618 magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7870619 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7870620 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7870621 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7870622 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7870623 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7870624 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7870625 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7870626 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7870627 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7870628 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7870629 were seeing all sorts of ways in which these people can put out the message to first time voters and those who are unsure of their voting rights they are replacing the tactics we saw in previous election cycles
7870630 knowingly provide false information with the intent to disenfranchise another person in a federal election
7870631 by early november were expecting spam emails to be sent giving the wrong location for a polling station or incorrect details about who has the right to vote
7870632 theres even a web site thats offering to register voters for 9 95 of course it doesnt cost anything to vote
7870633 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections
7870634 its really rebalancing the power not into the hands of the special interests and those with money but into the hands of citizens who actually now can organize themselves
7870635 let me just add that organized minorities are always more powerful than disorganized majorities

7870665 canadian government officials and some fishermen are considering the once unthinkable drilling for oil and gas on the fabled georges bank fishing ground their nation shares with the united states surging energy prices advances in drilling technology and the decline of fishing have combined to reignite interest in looking for oil on the vast elevated stretch of sea floor that sits roughly 100 miles off cape cod and runs northeasterly toward nova scotia nova scotias energy minister richard hurlburt said in an interview that it is possible that fishing and oil drilling can coexist on georges

7870667 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7870668 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7870669 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7870670 have won more medals than either china it would also help combat nationalism which is always quick to spread at these events
7870671 the dollar index has shown that it can at time override the oil fundamentals and will probably dominate until gustav defines a more definitive path
7870672 but the market is reacting to it and edging up
7870673 sometimes you cant even walk in the aisles its so packed
7870674 in the end it really is just a labor of love
7870675 you want a poster that looks like how a band sounds
7870676 when you get a group with a really oddball sound you can go kind of wild with the design
7870677 i was sketching around and i just drew that crazy face
7870678 the original sketch was one inch high and i thought it would be fun to blow it up i wanted the sound of boris to invade the poster the torn edges i almost wanted to look like they were invading someone elses poster their sound is kind of loud and crushing i dont know if others would put it that way but thats the way i interpreted it
7870679 one of the really interesting things to come out of bumbershoot for me was a couple who wanted me to design a wedding poster invitation for them
7870680 i think personally posters are a sign of a thriving community
7870681 getting to meet a lot of my colleagues is fun
7870682 its really inspiring to see all of that other work out there
7870683 ive been trying to take weekends and not work the job never stops its a hard job to have but its also a really liberating job i can do what i want
7870684 for example a couple of years ago for death cab for cuties transatlanticism i did two different posters
7870685 more people are waking up and saying i want to do that too
7870686 music has always been a big part of my life and when i moved out here i realized there was a big poster community here
7870687 his music to me is not quite gospel but it has that southern preacher vibe so i originally used a church
7870688 for this we went with something a little lighter and not so strongly themed but something that really fit with his music i tried to find images that reminded me of him
7870689 he is its most passionate and voluble fan he is the bill james of his field a master of history hierarchies personalities anecdote relics dates and events but he is also a guardian for unlike baseball jazz and the musicians who play it are endangered jazz today is responsible for only around three per cent of music sales in the united states and what even that small slice contains is highly questionable among the current top sellers on amazon in the jazz category are easy listening acts like kenny g and michael bubl

7870691 for me this is season of hope of new hope this is the cause of my life that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every american will have decent health care not as a privilege but as a right
7870692 we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and finally yes we will this november the torch with be passed again to a new generation of americans
7870693 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
7870694 it takes place at the terry fox canadian youth centre in ottawa ont you can do different sectors of work im doing medicine and health
7870695 theyll be some in class sessions and therell be different presenters theyll talk about their job their job duties how they got to where they are and those sorts of things
7870696 besides spending the second half of the trip in your sector you get to visit the house of commons senate and your member of parliament theres also a lot of interaction involved with the program i believe there are five people going from newfoundland and there are 30 people going in total a few people from each province this will give me the experience of travelling to a bigger centre and ill also be able to build friendships with people from all across canada
7870697 its actually a pretty good deal it costs 525 for the whole trip including your flight i have to pay the 525 but it doesnt come out of my own pocket you actually have to write letters and send them around to local businesses asking for donations so you really only need spending money
7870698 ive seen an extremely good response the lions club fire department cyn and a number of smaller businesses in town were really supportive of me at first my mom said that she would pay for the trip but when i spoke with the lady from the program she said that i should ask for donations because thats what everybody in the program does
7870699 at this point were still trying to crunch the data that we have but it looks like the fish that we measured are smaller than previous years
7870700 we heard that was the case in the harbour breton area as well fish were generally in the 50 cm range the catch rate in your area was the same and people seemed to be doing ok but reports indicated that the fish were quite small at a range of about 20 inches
7870701 im happy to report to you that we detected no violations in the harbour breton area during the first three weeks of the fishery thats great news
7870702 we had nine total violations in the province in three weeks the compliance rate is very very high in this fishery thats not to say that something didnt happen but we cant possibly be in every boat and check everybody that fishes however at the same time were very confident that this fishery enjoys a very high compliance rate
7870703 this tells us that people really enjoy this fishery and theyre out there for that reason because they enjoy it it tells is that people really enjoy their time on the water and that theyre not out there for other reasons
7870704 it also tells us that people dont want to jeopardize the fishery and they want it there for people to enjoy further down the road
7870705 newfoundland is a small place but it sure is scattered there are a lot of communities and a lot of small places so there are some places that we didnt necessarily operate out of everyday generally the indication from our fishery officers is that it was down from last year and it was down each week of the fishery so it seemed that there were more people out during the first week than the second and third week
7870706 weve been asking folks what theyve been hearing about that and theyve been telling us that cost of fuel has been an issue especially to somebody going out by themselves nobody really wants to spend 100 on fuel for five fish the weather absolutely played a role and unfortunately thats a fact of life here in newfoundland some people just prefer fall fish and decided to wait and fish a little later in the fall of the year
7870707 however were an enforcement group so thats not really our thing
7870708 well be sitting down with some of our colleagues in the fall with all of the data that we have and we should be able to put together an overall estimate of removal for the province based on air surveillance inspections a telephone survey and other observations
7870709 if we are to withdraw the library will cease to exist
7870710 i love the library id hate to see us not belong to it but there are certain things that we cant afford and we have to make sacrifices
7870711 salmon returns are really up in 2008 and theyre up on all the department of fisheries and oceans dfo monitored rivers in newfoundland and labrador with some rivers showing an amazing increase in the number of returning salmon
7870712 up to aug 10 2008 for example the exploits river which is on pace for a record year had a return of 33 591 salmon the average return on this river from 2003 to 2007 was 26 229 salmon the average return on the river from 1984 to 1991 was 9 552 fish
7870713 based on the numbers returning to salmon brook its probably safe to say that the entire gander river saw a similar increase in the number of salmon returns for 2008
7870714 as a matter of fact dfo has a formula where they extrapolate the number of salmon in the entire river based on what happens at salmon brook but they have not released this number for 2008 as of today aug 19
7870715 from 1984 to 1991 the average salmon returns to conne river was 6 187 so while the numbers improved in 2008 as compared to the average returns from 2003 to 2007 they are not even close to what they used to be
7870716 the trend of other newfoundland rivers seeing returns higher than average of years ago is not happening on conne river
7870717 there are no hard facts that the aquaculture projects in that area are having an impact on wild salmon numbers however there is some evidence and correlation between aquaculture projects and low salmon returns in other parts of the world
7870718 there are some reports coming out of british columbia for example that salmon smolts passing aquaculture sites pick up sea lice smolts may be able to withstand one or two parasites but when a smolt picks up three or four well thats more than their bodies can handle the sea lice are believed to be causing a lot of mortality in other parts of the world
7870719 a lot of salmon migrate along the south coast en route to rivers in newfoundland the maritimes maine and new england weve suggested to the federal government that the salmon caught by fishermen in st pierre and miquelon doesnt really belong to them as there arent any rivers on the islands
7870720 weve even suggested that the federal government buyout the french fishermen but their response is that canada should not have to pay to close out someone elses fishery
7870721 i dont think any dfo scientist would even predict what the returns will be like in 2009 because there are so many variables affecting salmon numbers such as water temperatures global warming the food chain at sea and poaching in inland waters and on the ocean
7870722 i went to a residence on a separate investigation and the individual became agitated with me as a police officer
7870723 she got upset ended up pulling out a knife from a knife block and attempted to come after me
7870724 it was a separate investigation that i was pursuing it was another criminal investigation but the individual thats under arrest now was involved with that investigation
7870725 i went to speak with the individual on a totally separate matter and she became totally agitated and tried to come after me
7870726 there is no such thing as a routine call its always scary for the police officer and its not routine work either
7870727 it can be disturbing that was a first for me all i was thinking was get out of there and be safe
7870728 we continuously receive training throughout our service to deal with situations like that
7870729 most of the time members of the public see a patrol car going to and coming back from a scene they dont always realize the danger factor in what seems to be even the most routine of calls

7870764 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7870765 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7870766 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7870767 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7870768 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7870769 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7870770 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7870771 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7870772 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7870773 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7870774 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool

7870777 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7870778 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7870779 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7870780 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7870781 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7870782 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7870783 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7870784 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7870785 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7870786 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7870787 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7870788 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7870789 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7870790 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7870791 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7870792 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7870793 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7870794 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7870795 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7870796 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7870797 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7870798 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7870799 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7870800 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7870801 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7870802 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7870803 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth

7870805 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7870806 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7870807 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7870808 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7870809 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7870810 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7870811 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7870812 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7870813 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7870814 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7870815 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7870816 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7870817 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7870818 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7870819 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7870820 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7870821 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7870822 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7870823 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7870824 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7870825 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7870826 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7870827 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7870828 see im gorgeous and perfect and it wasnt enough they had to retouch me oh girl youll never catch up
7870829 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7870830 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance

7870852 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

7870858 participating while on the public dime in a special session of the state senate that has served as nothing more than a political public relations gimmick
7870859 blast republicans robach and alesi for leaving albany without getting their jobs done
7870860 the candidates listed a litany of bills that the republicans senate refused to pass in a critical year for new yorkers including a property tax cap
7870861 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7870862 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7870863 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause

7870866 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7870867 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7870868 will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7870869 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
7870870 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
7870871 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples
7870872 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever be one state with georgia again
7870873 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have made their choice in life and they have made up their minds about with whom they should be and build their economic and political relations
7870874 a very strong signal to the west that were very serious
7870875 if youre not ready to give guarantees to the abkhazians and ossetians of peace and stability in the region we will recognize them
7870876 if the west is ready to give these guarantees russia will not recognize them
7870877 only see these guarantees as real if russians take part
7870878 the federation council is ready to recognize abkhazias and south ossetias independence if the people of these regions wish and if there is an appropriate decision by the russian president

7870909 someone needs to prove that immigration can swing congressional and senate elections before using the presdential race as a guinea pig
7870910 based on his experience in the private business sector as well as his legislative voting record chris widener is the clear choice in the race for the 10th senate district
7870911 widener has demonstrated both the best understanding of the issues of concern to our states employers and the highest commitment to working to achieve a strong economy and favorable business climate in ohio

7870938 unfortunately these recent survey results indicate that companies today are falling short and they will need to go back to the basics if they are to ultimately adopt virtualization technologies to achieve such benefits
7870939 try some abba maybe it will annoy him so much hell let us go
7870940 im sorry i cant do anything will you look at how inept i am here
7870941 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7870942 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
7870943 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
7870944 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7870945 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7870946 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7870947 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean he enthused
7870948 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7870949 look the clintons are dirty how many times do the republicans need to throw that in our faces turn the page they did most of the stuff that the republicans said they did whitewater catte futures filegate travelgate gennifer flowers katherina wilkie monica lewinsky turn the page
7870950 never walk over others in climbing the ladder to success you just might meet them on your way down
7870951 i have signed decrees on the recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7870952 taking into account the freely expressed will of the ossetian and abkhaz people
7870953 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7870954 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7870955 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
7870956 only yesterday i said there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the us navy passed through the bosphorus straits
7870957 we have also learnt that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
7870958 they talk about planned exercises and you can probably find some legitimacy in that but its very hard to believe that all the visits so far have been bringing only humanitarian aid
7870959 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrality of georgia
7870960 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7870961 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7870962 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
7870963 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7870964 but when they believed philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women 13 even simon himself believed and after being baptized he continued with philip and seeing signs and great miracles performed he was amazed
7870965 now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money
7870966 give me this power also so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
7870967 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7870968 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7870969 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7870970 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7870971 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7870972 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7870973 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7870974 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7870975 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7870976 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7870977 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7870978 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
7870979 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
7870980 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
7870981 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7870982 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7870983 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7870984 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7870985 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7870986 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7870987 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7870988 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7870989 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7870990 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7870991 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7870992 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7870993 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7870994 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7870995 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7870996 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7870997 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7870998 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7870999 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7871000 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7871001 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7871002 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7871003 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7871004 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7871005 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7871006 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7871007 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7871008 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7871009 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7871010 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7871011 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7871012 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7871013 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7871014 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7871015 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7871016 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7871017 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7871018 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7871019 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7871020 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7871021 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7871022 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7871023 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7871024 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7871025 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7871026 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7871027 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7871028 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7871029 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7871030 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows
7871031 a guam ci sono uomini il cui lavoro a tempo pieno consiste nel girare per le campagne e deflorare giovani vergini che pagano per il privilegio di stare con un uomo per la prima volta
7871032 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7871033 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7871034 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7871035 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7871036 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7871037 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7871038 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7871039 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7871040 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7871041 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7871042 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7871043 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7871044 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7871045 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7871046 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7871047 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7871048 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7871049 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7871050 i think there has been a great deal of healing
7871051 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7871052 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7871053 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7871054 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7871055 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7871056 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7871059 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7871060 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7871061 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7871062 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7871063 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7871064 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7871065 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7871067 sou terminantemente contra isso s interessa bancada de s o paulo uma riqueza que do rio tem que continuar no rio
7871068 o petr leo n o do governador do estado do rio de janeiro
7871069 em 2004 fiz estudos mostrando alguns equ vocos na aplica o dos recursos dos royalties de petr leo principalmente pelas prefeituras se voc olhar para os n meros de aplica o de recursos de alguns munic pios do norte fluminense que recebem muitos recursos de royalties voc tem distor es graves e absurdas portanto fundamental investir esses recursos em pol ticas sustent veis eu acho que boa sim a vincula o acho que d um norte desde que n o ponham a m o em coisas do nosso estado e da nossa cidade
7871070 sou presidente da frente parlamentar de defesa dos estados e munic pios produtores de petr leo da c mara dos deputados tenho conversado com muitos deputados senadores e outras autoridades para que o governo federal entenda que a revis o da divis o dos royalties uma injusti a o rio o principal produtor de petr leo e s o os munic pios do estado que sofrem grande impacto social e ambiental por conta da explora o do petr leo tenho lutado para impedir a inconseq ente pulveriza o desses benef cios e n o deixarei que continuem nos amea ando
7871071 sou contra a redistribui o e agirei no parlamento junto com a bancada de todos os estados que recebem os royalties para preservar essa renda
7871072 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7871073 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7871074 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7871075 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7871076 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7871077 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7871078 bush however proudly touted his lack of public experience saying it gave him
7871079 this is a team thats very reflective of obama who has made it pretty clear in his speeches and statements during the campaign that he believes that diplomacy has been undervalued over the past few years and that the united states shouldnt fear to negotiate
7871080 had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks
7871081 senator hagel and senator reed may be coming with us look they are both experts on foreign policy they reflect i think a traditional bipartisan wisdom when it comes to foreign policy neither of them are ideologues but try to get the facts right and make a determination about whats best for u s interests
7871082 i believe that the president of the united states since sept 11 has led this nation with great strength and clarity and i believe that he should be re elected and im confident that he will do so
7871083 he lives off the money made by other men and left to their daughters or wives
7871084 a pioneer having transformed souvenir trinkets to objets dart with world class appeal
7871085 the earrings were beautiful but there was no way a western woman could wear them the way an african woman could
7871086 i think africas indigenous and cultural heritage is under appreciated both in africa and worldwide
7871087 baraka es una comedia sobre la amistad y sus l mites
7871088 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7871089 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7871090 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7871091 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7871092 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7871093 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7871094 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7871095 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7871096 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7871097 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7871098 the bonds have been set low enough so that we believe that most people will bond out in a relatively short time
7871099 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7871100 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
7871101 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
7871102 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
7871103 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
7871104 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused
7871105 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7871106 they may have grown up in dirt floor shacks but they had a comic book paid for by people like bill gates i hate you bill gates i hate you
7871107 it seems like every new corner we turn the rockefellers are already there and in some cases they have been there for a long long time
7871108 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7871109 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7871110 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7871111 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
7871112 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
7871113 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig
7871114 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7871115 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7871116 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7871117 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7871118 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7871119 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7871120 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7871121 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7871122 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7871123 who are open to doing something on the production side
7871124 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7871125 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7871126 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7871127 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7871128 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7871129 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7871130 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7871131 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7871132 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7871133 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7871134 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7871135 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7871136 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7871137 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7871138 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7871139 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7871140 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7871141 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7871142 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7871143 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7871144 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7871145 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7871146 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7871147 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7871148 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7871149 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7871150 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7871151 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7871152 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7871153 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7871154 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7871155 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7871156 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7871157 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7871158 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7871159 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7871160 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7871161 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7871198 ive got an interview this monday with anything i should know
7871199 we recently came across your site while searching for bloggers
7871200 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7871201 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7871202 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7871203 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7871204 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7871205 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7871206 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7871207 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7871208 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7871209 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7871210 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7871211 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7871212 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7871213 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7871214 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7871215 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7871216 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7871217 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7871218 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7871219 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7871220 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either

7871224 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7871225 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7871226 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7871227 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7871228 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7871229 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him

7871231 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7871232 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7871233 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7871234 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7871235 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7871236 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7871237 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7871238 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7871239 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7871240 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7871241 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7871242 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7871243 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

7871254 we have clamped curfew in three places baliguda phulbani and tumudibandh
7871255 it expresses its solidarity with local churches and the religious orders involved and condemns these actions which are an affront to dignity peoples freedom and endanger peaceful civil coexistence
7871256 people are totally harassed driven away from their homes beaten up and institutions destroyed
7871257 i think my department should intensify our contacts with religious leaders
7871258 they are doing a good job let us given them some more time

7871290 it is with great regret that we as founders and our board call you to urgent prayer as you may have already heard todd and shonnah bentley are experiencing some current marital difficulties and have separated god tv is anxious that our viewers and partners will first of all respond to these unfortunate circumstances with an attitude of christ like maturity and pray fervently for todd shonnah and their children as a family who are precious to the lord while we have learned today that immorality was not an issue no doubt the enemy has exploited vulnerabilities in their marriage what the devil has not counted on is the christ like maturity and intercession that is currently being raised up all across the earth in response we hope you will join us as a part of this prayer covering it is god tvs position that marriage is a foundational cornerstone to those families called to ministry and would believe that those who have spiritual oversight for todd and shonnahs ministry will recommend a time of sabbatical for the family in order to seek reconciliation within their marriage should these reports be accurate as many of you know august 8th was our final lakeland broadcast we do however believe that it is important to recognize and defend the authenticity of this outpouring by the testimonies of the countless thousands who viewed on god tv or attended at lakeland and were healed set free and delivered through jesus christ there are many churches around the uk usa and the world who are currently holding nightly revival meetings affecting whole communities once again at this time may we encourage all to pray for the family and soberly remember that all of us will be required to give account to the lord for our lives it is our earnest prayer that todd and shonnah will be fully reconciled rory wendy alec and the board of god tv
7871291 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
7871292 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
7871293 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
7871294 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
7871295 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
7871296 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
7871297 the were just in conversation mantra can become a shtick whereby emergent leaders are easy to listen to and impossible to pin down its one thing for a high school student to be in process with his theology its another thing for adults who write books and speak around the world about their musings and misgivings i agree that there must be space for christians to ask hard questions and explore the tensions in faith but i seriously question that this space should be hugely public where hundreds of thousands of men and women are eagerly awaiting the next book or blog or podcast arising from your faith journey no matter what new label you put on it once you start selling thousands of books speaking all over the country and world and being looked to for spiritual and ecclesiastical direction youre no longer just a conversation partner you are a leader and teacher
7871298 not many of you should become teachers my brothers for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness

7871304 certain avant garde evangelicals sometimes act as if the demise of certainty is a dramatic new intellectual development rather than seeing it for what it actually is an echo of the old unbelief it is unbelief cloaked in a religious disguise and seeking legitimacy as if it were merely a humbler kind of faith but its not faith at all in reality the contemporary refusal to regard any truth as sure and certain is the worst kind of infidelity the churchs duty has always been to confront such skepticism and answer it by clearly proclaiming the truth god has revealed in his word

7871313 the popularity of other apple products particularly the ipod has drawn more users to the apple platform
7871314 as a result you see this halo effect of people buying apple computers in addition to their ipods quantifying the halo effect is difficult but we certainly believe that effect exists
7871315 if you look at just the u s home market apple had a 10 4 percent share at the end of the first quarter of this year compared to 7 5 percent for the first quarter of 2007 and 5 4 percent for the first quarter of 2006
7871316 do you notice the difference between people buying computers in an apple store and a store that sells windows machines it really is a different experience
7871317 the main thing is the level of the assistance you get in those stores is phenomenal
7871318 the one time i had a problem with my mac the ability to just head over to the store with my machine under my arm and leave after talking to somebody who really knows what theyre talking about thats really neat
7871319 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7871320 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7871321 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7871322 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by the pagan religion wicca popularized by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer

7871327 the united states has no illusions about the regime in pyongyang
7871328 the united states is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7871329 north korea does not care whether it continues remaining on the list of those countries which are disobedient to the united states
7871330 south korea said tuesdays angry statement by the north fits a familiar pattern of negotiation by fist shaking
7871331 this is quite an expected reaction from north korea given that not much has happened since they symbolically exploded the cooling tower
7871332 from the north korean perspective they thrive on crisis to make progress in their favor
7871333 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7871334 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7871335 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7871336 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7871337 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7871338 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7871339 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7871340 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7871341 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7871342 they want to see if there is any interest there
7871343 he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind
7871344 he said he missed it but at the same time he said hes content and excited to go into the next phase of his life so i dont really look too strongly to that possibility
7871345 fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack
7871346 as always well continue to research all of our options

7871366 terkadang saya muak melihat iklan pendidikan gratis yang ada di televisi lokal iklan tersebut kesan pembodohan buat masyarakat nyatanya masyarakat masih harus membayar uang dengan berbagai alasan ditambah dengan biaya buku yang jumlahnya sangat besar hal itu sangt ditekankan kepada murid jadi mau tidak mau kita mesti mengikuti
7871367 kita tidak bisa menyalahkan asumsi masyarakat terkait dengan pendidikan gratis karena yang namanya gratis pengertiannya sudah tentu pendidikan cuma cuma kalau masih bayr tidak bisa dikatakan pendidikan gratis lebih tepat kalau pendidian bersubsidi

7871374 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7871375 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7871376 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7871377 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7871378 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7871379 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7871380 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7871381 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7871382 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7871383 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7871384 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7871385 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7871386 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7871387 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7871388 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7871389 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers

7871391 its difficult to say whether the dialogue or the characters are more wooden
7871392 an enjoyable escapade and a great introduction to the forthcoming series just not the seventh star wars film fans were hoping for
7871393 in the absence of any extensive innovation the video game ready results play more like a feature length promo for the imminent tv series of the same name than a stand alone event
7871394 despite some absolutely gorgeous animation and adjusting expectations for what clone wars is meant to be the force is not strong with this one
7871395 the clone wars is minor to the point of irrelevance nothing more than a stylized direct to dvd shrug projected onto a big screen while lucas launches two more tv series filling in prequel blanks better left empty
7871396 expectations were set so low by george lucass lousy trilogy of
7871397 its more of a problem when a film feels like a videogame which implies a story thats more fun to play through than watch unfortunately theres no interactive option for star wars the clone wars
7871398 the best that can be said about the movie is that its harmless and mostly charmless
7871399 the movie gets more cluttered and confused as it moves along though its dotted with so many generic battle scenes and paint by numbers light saber combat sequences that you can see how its at least attempting to mimic the illusion of excitement
7871400 the story lacks narrative tension the dialogue is stilted and overblown a problem also in some of the live action incarnations that combined with visuals that consistently lack punch leaves little to engage us
7871401 clone wars will appeal only to the most tolerant galactically minded children and their parents
7871402 unfolds with all the entertainment value of watching somebody else play a video game
7871403 i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun
7871404 hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with
7871405 my mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice
7871406 but its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
7871407 i dont think its something well decide until the baby comes

7871437 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7871438 it has been confirmed to us that a machine appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party

7871442 with bloated staffs and citizens e mailing opinions 24 7 barack obama and john mccain probably dont feel the need for any more advice but the presidential candidates could learn a thing or two by watching the best of the movies that have been made about political campaigns

7871449 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7871450 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7871451 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7871452 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7871453 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7871454 for some reason that story doesnt seem to be in our system
7871455 were an industry with a net profit of just 1 to 2 of sales so any increase is going to have an effect on cost to consumers
7871456 what rewards do you expect from your god for your suffering
7871457 such rewards as we are not able to describe nor can your mind comprehend
7871458 really have you gone mad that you want to die come cross out your name from the lists and offer sacrifice to the gods asking their forgiveness
7871459 i have not lost my mind but rather have i found it
7871460 you are blessed my lord because you have believed in christ you have obtained a great treasure do not regret anything earthly neither beauty nor youth nor riches everything worldly is dust and ashes only faith and good deeds are pleasing to god
7871461 let your gods say what blessings they promise me and then i shall worship them but if they cannot do this then why should i worship them

7871471 we are looking at and other people are looking at how to replicate this across the country
7871472 with sketchup we dreamed of a simple tool that would give people the ability to think fast and iterate often on complex building design problems with this release ies is plugging a set of energy analysis tools into sketchup at just the right level of complexity enabling designers to think not just about how a building might look but also how it will perform in a sustainable world
7871473 im incredibly excited by todays launch in many ways its a culmination of 14 years of work when i founded ies in 1994 my aim was to develop what were primarily academic tools and bring them into mainstream use by linking our tools directly to google sketchup and continuing to develop different levels of interface we are making the sustainable design potential of performance analysis very easily available to a huge number of professionals
7871474 we are very excited about the possibilities the ies sketchup plug in presents plans to extend this capability into the hands of more of our staff are already underway our energy analysis team is doing an exceptional job of documenting the work flow so that we will easily be able to engage others once the product is officially launched this connectivity allows many more of our architectural staff to take advantage of iess environmental analysis capabilities to better assure that our designs are being formed for optimal performance in early design
7871475 this new tool means we now have the ability to integrate building performance analysis from early conceptual design using sketchup through our entire design process using revit architecture faster feedback in design affords more opportunity to innovate with sustainability in mind this means not only can we make the right decisions in the first place we can make the right decision at every step in the process
7871476 im very comfortable with our young prospects coming here and doing it the way argenis reyes has done it the way daniel murphy has done it the way nick evans has done it i feel comfortable internally that well find a way to get it done
7871477 i remember that a soldier is just a uniform following orders a warrior is the man or woman that follows their conscience and does the right thing in the face of adversity
7871478 the military way underrates t b i and its symptoms
7871479 apart from the war itself this department and i have no higher priority
7871480 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
7871481 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
7871482 if every woman in the world told the truth at the same time the world as we know it would change forever
7871483 critics and news executives split over sexism in clinton coverage
7871484 largely the problem was on cable and in the blogosphere and on the internet and thats a relatively small audience
7871485 but while it was limited it was limited to influential people
7871486 secondly we know something about how the electorate is using the new media environment
7871487 meaning lots of cable channels that you have an option to go to even when youre watching traditional mainstream broadcast people arent watching 30 minutes of nbc or cbs or abc anymore theres a whole part of the electorate that is watching a segment of it it gets what it needs of politics and it starts to channel surf to find other political information and over a third of the electorate says its done that at least once or twice in this most recent viewing experience
7871488 obama changes the metaphor because king took his people to the mountain obama can take them somewhere else
7871489 her calling is to mine the facts hidden in all the spin
7871490 i suppose you get used to this coming here every day
7871491 but it is always good to watch peoples faces as they come in that reminds you how lucky you are
7871492 well its the colour of scrambled egg for a clue
7871493 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7871494 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7871495 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
7871496 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7871497 all the girly stuff is not relaxed for me its hard work
7871498 that i can do i can give you that its all that girly stuff i cant do
7871499 comfortable is not the way i would put it resigned is probably the right word
7871500 a minimal amount of experimentation went on in my teenage years there was only so much i could do with the way i look i was never big into wearing mascara or blue eyeliner its very easy for me to look like a goth where very little goes a very long way it feels more natural for me to wear a tux than a ball gown that is a kind of transvestism for me i never had an aspiration to look like a doll which is fortunate
7871501 i still have some of those dresses actually i wore a dress the other day that i made when i was 15 or 16
7871502 it was hanging in my old room in my parents house and i found it so i put it on for a bit of a laugh but i ended up enjoying wearing it though i didnt look in many mirrors
7871503 it was hand done because i had never learned how to operate an electric sewing machine maybe thats the reason i like wearing hand made clothes because i really appreciate the work that goes into them
7871504 there was something about those clothes at that time that was so refreshing they felt really sculptural playful and witty
7871505 i love that collection i have pretty much all of it and wear it all the time i was constantly showing up to meet them wearing two or three shirts they made a really personal and slightly untidy and vagrant attitude in me really beautiful in the clothes they created and thats really a dream
7871506 their clothes have attitude and the physical quality of their clothes is delicious
7871507 red carpet dressing sounds like something that would take you out of your own instincts but i havent gotten there yet i will wear what i want to wear
7871508 the motion academy of doo da what was it called the prize is probably the most famous in the world for months at least people can tell you who won the oscars but nobody really knows who wins the pulitzer prize or the nobel peace prize its shameful but true a lot of people really want one really really want one and im embarrassed because i never did and i feel a little ashamed that i was given one when i didnt really want one
7871509 i feel as though something slightly obscene happened as though there was some sort of orgy and i still have yet to see a photograph or an image
7871510 the microphone picked up for three billion people to hear
7871511 it is important to bring the film up to the present as i say in it things are worse now than we ever imagined they could be but were getting used to being disillusioned and thats a good thing because then people can actually take some kind of action once they get over the shock
7871512 people are finding new ways and different ways and unimagined ways of being powerful
7871513 its really interesting that someone with my political and cultural orientation could find a space in hollywood popping up occasionally even to the extent of being given an oscar its kind of amazing
7871514 it feels like there is a possibility for our generation point being that one doesnt necessarily have to give it all up one can actually stand up and be counted just saying that makes me feel a little defeated because it feels so fanciful but the evidence is there
7871515 it has been a blessed opportunity for me to make films within hollywood to disguise myself and infiltrate in the way ive been able to
7871516 not by my own design but because i was given opportunities to go there in the first place
7871517 shes so naturally beautiful but not at all protective of that
7871518 were actually sort of lovers in this one and were even worse to each other
7871519 we were staying with him recently at his beautiful house on lake como
7871520 the performing is just dressing up and playing the significant element is the choice of colleagues and by virtue of that the choice of project playing katie cox in burn after reading is just what i can do in that film but i support that film and that film is about a kind of randomness which i think is a really interesting thing to make a film about its about a kind of random chain of events in a way at the heart of it i guess you could say its about the same sort of randomness at the heart of michael clayton its about this kind of structurelessness which i think if were going to be fully properly responsibly disillusioned weve got to kind of chow down
7871521 the only person i ever met who called me swilda who gave me that name is matt dillon
7871522 ability to have a rocking laugh no matter whats going on in your life
7871523 id like to be home for so long that i might even get to the point where id like to leave it again but that will be a long time two or three years
7871524 we dont read that stuff and we dont know anybody who does
7871525 everybody who knows us is so relaxed about everything and as far as i can make out the scandalous idea about us is that were really the shock if the people we live amongst do read it they very sweetly lay it to one side when theyre around us it really doesnt affect us its fairy stories of the worst kind
7871526 i do think its interesting that the most transgressive thing you can do in life within that tabloid bracket is be happy
7871527 what people want to know about seems to be animosity and friction and things that break and things that break people and the truth is there isnt a story
7871528 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7871529 members of the agency are clearly on heightened alert based upon the security thats involved with a convention the size of the one that is occurring in denver behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
7871530 i cannot talk about the federal implications associated with this case
7871531 however the fact that we are able to draw a nexis between this suspect and these other parties were extremely happy
7871532 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7871533 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads

7871546 even if one has the wealth and the ability to marry one thousand women the sharia is saying dont go beyond four sharia is the supreme law of islam if it has forbidden something why should one question that
7871547 how do you decide how much to stock and what
7871548 as a government we will do everything in our powers to ensure that children are protected from these child perverts and exploiters we will stringently apply the provisions of the childrens act 2005 and other laws that protect children
7871549 our children remain our priority and their future is the focus of our development efforts anyone who wants to derail our goal for our children will have to face the full force of the law
7871550 our children are not only a reflection of what the gambia would look like in the future they are the future itself and posterity would judge us by the behaviour and life styles we inculcate in them today
7871551 for my part i solemnly reaffirm the unalloyed and unwavering commitment of the government of the under the dynamic and inspirational leadership of h e dr alhaji yahya ajj jammeh to the fulfilment of the rights of children and their protection from abuse exploitation and violence
7871552 lift her out and see if she goes back in if you lift her two or three times today and she always goes back then she probably is broody if shes not serious about it she will get distracted when you lift her and wander off
7871553 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7871554 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7871555 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7871556 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7871557 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7871558 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7871559 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7871560 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states

7871566 the new security plan should also include shia cities like hwaider khirnabat and abara
7871567 the forces of the new security plan took all our weapons to the extent that we cannot fight al qaeda any more we are impotent
7871568 no shia vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
7871569 we all know that shia militias in baquba are a source of instability
7871570 influential shia members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent
7871571 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7871572 i dont dismiss the possibility that it could be higher but thats the very likely scenario

7871574 no it was just really great to meet him and people that you usually see on tv to me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7871575 no thats her business now that were just friends thats not something i have to worry about
7871576 i really enjoyed the second week being able to go out with my teammates i had a great week
7871577 the things you get asked to do this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens im a girl on the loose damn it

7871585 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7871586 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7871587 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7871588 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7871589 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7871590 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7871591 this vote means that malaysians want a change we are entering parliament with a clear agenda its time that you behave and accept the stark realities of the day
7871592 i think it will definitely be an important milestone and also an important yardstick on abdullahs administrations continuity and also popularity but i think most importantly it will also be a voice of discontent which should barisan national lose this by election i think it will definitely be a yardstick of peoples continuous rejection of the communal formula presented by barisan national

7871599 all i need to know in life i learned from my chickens by michaele olseon
7871600 we have just braved the rain to see to the chickens and quail
7871601 the real concern i have as a central banker is whether or not inflation begins to affect the mentality of spending patterns by consumers and pricing patterns by producers
7871602 a trend that prevailed throughout 2007 and has continued through the first half of 2008
7871603 however it should be noted that the acceleration in decline was only moderate in june the may numbers reported annual declines of 16 9 and 15 8 respectively
7871604 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7871605 americans continue to be faced with elevated borrowing costs tighter lending conditions fewer job opportunities moderating real wages and an end to large fiscal stimulus packages
7871606 whats driving markets right now is lack of liquidity in equity markets as well as foreign exchange markets and also the tension around financials
7871607 if something comes out regarding lehmans that is positive regardless of the data that will override it
7871608 within the fed opinions are divided between those who would like to see higher interest rates in order to bring down inflationary pressures and those who prefer a prolonged pause given the ongoing deterioration of economic activity and the recent decline in commodity prices
7871609 in our view the fed is likely to keep its target rate unaltered until the second half of 2009

7871615 when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom

7871643 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
7871644 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
7871645 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
7871646 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player even so i didnt feel as though i was at my total best against west ham
7871647 this time is always very difficult but they know how important this game is and everyone needs to be focusing just on the game
7871648 it is the same situation we are working hard on trying to improve the squad if possible but for now we are just concentrating on the game
7871649 we have a better squad and we were starting to play really well at the end of pre season
7871650 then we started playing bad but the only positive thing is that we are winning
7871651 it is really good if you can win without playing well because it means that when you start to play well it will be easier

7871683 at one time we too were foolish disobedient deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures we lived in malice and envy being hated and hating one another but when the kindness and love of god our savior appeared h e saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy he saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit whom he poured out on us generously through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life

7871724 das aufgehen der schubumkehr ist teil des pilotentrainings am flugsimulator so etwas kann man als pilot fliegen deshalb st rzt man nicht ab
7871725 wenn es stimmt dass die maschine 500 meter mehr runway gebraucht hat als normal dann hat sie einfach zu langsam beschleunigt daher hat sie ihre abhebegeschwindigkeit nicht erreicht die gro e frage ist nur warum die schubumkehr alleine war es sicher nicht
7871726 wenn sie wirklich glaubt mit ihren berzogenen forderungen auch noch eine steuerentlastung in den kommenden jahren durchf hren zu k nnen da hilft alles sch nreden nichts bei diesen forderungen ist eine steuerreform gef hrdet
7871727 die sp setzt also bewusst und fahrl ssig jegliche steuerentlastung aufs spiel wenn sie aus rein wahltaktischen motiven und ohne jede staatspolitische verantwortung ihre wahlzuckerl unters volk bringt
7871728 selbstverst ndlich werden wir uns so wie es der parlamentarischen gepflogenheit entspricht die gesetzesantr ge der sp genau ansehen wenn sie erst einmal auf dem tisch liegen ganz genau werden wir dabei auf die soziale treffsicherheit und finanzierbarkeit achten denn wir geben uns nicht dem billigen populismus hin wie die sp vor den wahlen alles zu versprechen und nachher nichts zu halten
7871729 blicherweise macht man bei so gro en gesetzes nderungen jedenfalls ein ausf hrliches begutachtungsverfahren wo mit experten alle f r und wider diskutiert werden die sp interessiert sich daf r aber nicht sie will nur ihre wahltaktik im parlament durchpeitschen

7871772 i think romney is a fine man and hes always been decent to me but i have a very serious concern and i think the people of massachusetts had about his engagement in the job of governor of massachusetts he spent what was it almost 300 days of the last year of his office out of state and it was indicative of how little attention he was paying to us and weve got some serious challenges
7871773 s ources close to mccains campaign told fox news that his decision may come sooner than that possibly on thursday when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination at invesco field in denver

7871778 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7871779 everything we went through now we are getting our reward
7871780 it seems as though people are firing from every courtyard in the town
7871781 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7871782 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely

7871784 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others

7871789 its a good thing for us to have the alternative view point out here
7871790 as people become more familiar with obama the celebrity aspect of him will pass
7871791 theres a lot of youth support of mccain that doesnt gets out there
7871792 es feo y excesivo una bofetada para los ciudadanos romanos si fuese mi decisi n lo demoler a por completo pero como no tenemos el dinero esto no es posible
7871793 somos una ciudad esclavizada por su pasado tan aferrada a ser el hogar del arte de la cultura y de la creatividad que no se da cuenta de que en realidad es est tica y reh n de pol ticos arque logos e intelectuales que hablan y hablan pero no hacen nada
7871794 dijo franco rocca quien posee un bar a la vuelta de la esquina
7871795 lamentablemente sta es una ciudad en la que ese tipo de arquitectura simplemente no ser aceptada
7871796 este es un triste legado de las administraciones previas impuesto sobre los ciudadanos desde arriba por dos alcaldes que lo deseaban a cualquier costo
7871797 si roma contin a de este modo se convertir en una hermosa necr polis hermosa para los japoneses quienes vienen aqu a hacer compras y para los americanos que se emborrachan en el centro pero sin duda no ser una ciudad moderna
7871798 la m sica estuvo a la vanguardia de esa tendencia en la que parec a que todos los artistas estaban en alguna banda y algunos de ellos incluso estudiaron solfeo antes de acercarse a estas nuevas formas de arte
7871799 el precio de la gasolina ha estado clave en la ca da de los turistas franceses que mayoritariamente vienen en coche pero se da un repunte del turismo alem n que est creciendo un 4 cuando en el conjunto de espa a est cayendo
7871800 el turismo no est en crisis pero es normal que en momentos como ste se resientan algunos conceptos como el gasto en todo caso la inflexi n a la baja es causa de la ca da del mercado franc s
7871801 en los seis primeros meses la cifra de turistas ha ca do un 2 pero podemos acabar el a o de manera neutra resistiendo relativamente bien una situaci n complicada y hay que buscar turistas en lugares donde no pasan crisis
7871802 en general hay en la sociedad una atracci n una curiosidad y un respeto grandes por la antig edad
7871803 la antig edad a n tiene magia no es un tema acabado al contrario las grandes exposiciones ponen de manifiesto esa atracci n me parece que son algo enormemente positivo muy bueno presentando de manera muy atractiva las culturas del pasado realizan un loable esfuerzo de divulgaci n la gente se da c uenta de que no todo es del d a actual y descubren fascinados que muchas cosas que cre an modernas la tecnolog a hidr ulica o la ingenier a en realidad ya exist an hace siglos o milenios y con ello entienden la gran deuda que tenemos con la antig edad
7871804 ganamos todos los especialistas y la gente que se acerca para conocer algo que apenas sab a
7871805 estas exposiciones sirven para que se investiguen aspectos nuevos de la historia para que se restauren objetos gracias a spqr por ejemplo se pudieron restaurar los hallazgos de 2000 del foro de seg briga ahora listos para su exhibici n en museo sirven tambi n para que salgan a la luz y se estudien materiales in ditos para revolver almacenes hacer fichas nuevas el gran p blico tiene que ser el cliente principal y no el especialista eso no ha de olvidarse nunca pero ha de haber y de hecho siempre lo hay un gui o al estudioso el cat logo que se publica con motivo de la exposici n es siempre una aportaci n nueva algo que queda aunque la exhibici n sea pasajera y que viene a engrosar la bibliograf a sobre el tema
7871806 ahora son exposiciones rutilantes muy atractivas extraordinariamente bien dise adas y presentadas la gente se ha acostumbrado a consumirlas y muchos se desplazan para verlas a otras ciudades o incluso a otros pa ses el fen meno tiene en algunos casos qu le vamos a hacer algo de esnobismo has visto ya a los b rbaros en venecia
7871807 bueno es que estamos tan acostumbrados al espect culo a que nos sorprendan que si los dise adores de estas exposiciones no inventan algo nuevo nos sentimos decepcionados es dif cil presentar materiales de la antig edad sin que den sensaci n de d j vu se pugna por conseguir m s efectos para ganar m s p blico se intenta que la visita a la exposici n sea una experiencia impactante no me parece que haya nada malo en eso siempre y cuando se respete la pieza que ha de ser lo principal y no el dise o estamos hablando claro de objetos con un valor enorme y hay que subrayar su atractivo para que dialoguen con el visitante la exposici n que no estar a bien es la que los sepulte entre efectos o los trate con desconsideraci n lo principal es lo principal
7871808 crean las condiciones necesarias para potenciar socialmente el conocimiento de la antig edad es parecida a la aproximaci n que se hace por ejemplo a trav s de una novela
7871809 hay mucho dinero y un gran marketing alrededor pero en ltima instancia los efectos de este fen meno son beneficiosos para el p blico y para el mundo cient fico sus contenidos llegan hacen reflexionar y despiertan o estimulan un inter s por el mundo antiguo cuyos frutos recogemos todos
7871810 el precio de la gasolina ha estado clave en la ca da de los turistas franceses que mayoritariamente vienen en coche pero se da un repunte del turismo alem n que est creciendo un 4 cuando en el conjunto de espa a est cayendo

7872066 what is the thing that scares you the most with emma and her diabetes
7872067 i would argue that this is a direct empirical demonstration of gould like contingency in evolution
7872068 you cant do an exact replay in nature but we were able to literally put all these populations in virtually identical environments and show that contingency is really what had occurred
7872069 a mutation that doesnt improve an organisms ability to survive and reproduce cant be favored by evolution so whether the microbe happens to have that necessary mutation when the second evolutionary change occurs becomes purely a matter of chance

7872090 ive just finished coding an application for the iphone ipod touch it gives the illusion of a 3d hologram jumping off the screen the application works by assuming a constant viewing angle 35 45 degrees typical for when the device is placed on a tabletop the 3d scenes perspective is warped using anamorphosis the same technique used in hans holbeins painting the ambassadors this application does the exact same but updates dynamically
7872091 the ihologram app was not real it was an illustration of an idea i had which i believe could work with the technology combining anamorphosis and motion sensing unfortunately im just an ideas person and i can show how things should look but im no hardcore programmer

7872130 i estimate 1000 people were there and a lot of elderly people because the keytes had a lot of friends across the generations rev lambert said
7872131 many people were hurting some were still angry and some were just sad but within that we were still able to celebrate these special people
7872132 when i say special i dont mean outstanding they were our grandparents our parents and our neighbours ordinary folks who had been in our community for decades
7872133 all the family were there including margarets mother and brothers rev lambert said
7872134 espero ter um bom final de semana em misano apesar do azar que tive aqui no ano passado
7872135 o circuito de misano um dos mais r pidos mas parece pequeno e estreito ainda que tenha um bom n vel de ader ncia no ano passado usamos pneus intermedi rios devido ao calor que fez a pista tamb m era muito desigual talvez seu maior defeito
7872136 no meu ponto de vista o mais importante de misano ter uma boa freada e uma estabilidade correta quando acelerar nas curvas o tipo de corrida que requer um piloto agressivo
7872137 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7872138 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7872139 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7872140 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7872141 hello its jenn its 6 40am our time or thereabouts and im done im finished all the way down
7872142 depois do desastre da rep blica tcheca vou com total confian a de que tudo ir transcorrer melhor e de que poderemos conquistar um resultado positivo
7872143 we are particularly pleased about the state governments renewed commitment to the public tafe system and the governments intention that our tafes should continue to be leaders across the nation
7872144 it is clear that the government has paid attention to the large number of submissions it received about reforming the victorian training system
7872145 we think this is a bold reform package from the state government and one which seeks to position our tafe system both nationally and internationally
7872146 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7872147 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7872148 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7872149 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7872150 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7872151 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7872152 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7872153 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7872154 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7872155 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7872156 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7872157 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7872158 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7872159 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7872160 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7872161 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7872162 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7872163 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7872164 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7872165 i estimate 1000 people were there and a lot of elderly people because the keytes had a lot of friends across the generations rev lambert said
7872166 many people were hurting some were still angry and some were just sad but within that we were still able to celebrate these special people
7872167 when i say special i dont mean outstanding they were our grandparents our parents and our neighbours ordinary folks who had been in our community for decades
7872168 all the family were there including margarets mother and brothers rev lambert said
7872169 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7872170 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7872171 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7872172 one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the
7872173 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
7872174 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7872175 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7872176 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7872177 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7872178 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7872179 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7872180 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7872181 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7872182 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7872183 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7872184 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7872185 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7872186 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7872187 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7872188 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7872189 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7872190 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7872191 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7872192 hi its jenn im phoning from abiquiui its about 2 oclock i think on sunday afternoon i think im going to head out now because its just started to rain and its just got cool friday night got very sick so managed about 50 miles yesterday just dragging myself along rested up a bit feel better today so going to push on a bit but dont think im going to be getting a sub 20 never mind ok take care bye

7872194 we have to wait and see if we get him over on time
7872195 the good thing is that he has been playing regularly and travelling around the world regularly with the us national team
7872196 when i first met him he came across as one of these boys who would not be fazed by a great deal
7872197 he seems quite a confident lad if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage
7872198 david wants to stay with us and we want to keep him
7872199 hes had a short discussion with the manager and when the transfer window closes im sure well sort it out
7872200 carl heard jenn was feeling ill in abiquiu wanted to send a message out her
7872201 youre well ahead of everything you need to be ahead of
7872202 remind her that if she finishes at all shell be the first woman single speeder to do it but i know that id love to see a new overall single speed record set id bet trish wouldnt mind seeing a new womens record set either but records aside tell her to be as safe as she needs to be but only quit the race when she knows shes out the clock is nothing this is the ride of a lifetime
7872203 i got about 30 miles from the stretch outside cuba when i was pulled over by a police officer and told to get off the road and get to sleep because its not safe to be riding out here on your own
7872204 ive been hanging around grants at a mcdonalds and eating ice cream and more ice cream and food and stocking up
7872205 but that might be pushing it a bit given how late it is now
7872206 we had one overt policy which was one of negotiation and confidence building and a covert policy which was continuation of activities
7872207 during our negotiations and so long as we were not subjected to sanctions we could import technology we should have negotiated for so long and benefited from the atmosphere of negotiations to the extent we could import all the technology needed
7872208 iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of iraqi shia militants
7872209 i voted against the amendment to designate irans revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization because i dont trust this administration
7872210 this senator biden correctly says israel could not suppress hizbullah in lebanon so how can the u s stand face to face with a nation of 70 million this is the blessing of the guardianship of the jurists the theocracy which plants such thoughts in the hearts of u s senators and forces them to make such confessions
7872211 he really hurt the people of north carolina and he could have hurt the democratic party overall
7872212 he got us all revved up in the first place
7872213 going to have mixed emotions about his departure because of your expenses

7872226 rio is contributing less than 37 per cent of underlying profit which is similar to the average of the last four reporting periods and confirms our belief that the 44 per cent of the combined company we are offering rio shareholders remains a substantial and compelling premium

7872231 the nokia n79 packs cutting edge technology into a compact design a characteristic of the iconic nseries that allows people to discover create and share their passions with others
7872232 it has been designed for those who want a device that is as appealing as it is powerful and comes with interchangeable covers that have automatically matching screen themes this balance of performance and style means that it is a powerful and defining step forward from the popular and very successful nokia n72 and nokia n73
7872233 since the first nokia nseries device came to market in 2005 this range of devices has consistently represented cutting edge technology combined with an unparalleled user experience the nokia n96 builds upon this tradition to bring mobility to todays most valuable internet services
7872234 with support for movies music games navigation and more right out of the box the real power of the nokia n96 is that it provides an open application environment for users to define their own mobile lifestyle
7872235 if i dont phone in from here then people back home arent going to hear from me for three days so i had to come back which is frustrating im really tired big day yesterday lots of miles and made it into pie town late last night
7872236 i dont think it would be a balanced picture if we did not highlight the successes over the past 12 months
7872237 we have a very successful beer business we have a beer business that every brewer in the world would like to own
7872238 we will look at all options at the time weve concluded the review
7872239 we certainly will not be expecting to have very significant writedowns like the ones this year
7872240 while we see some regional differences in total around the globe we are not seeing any downturn in demand for our products or services in the minerals industry
7872241 we see this as a good market for acquisitions we have the cash flow to do it and we see markets in the world that we want to get into
7872242 so its going to continue to be a strong part of our business and were actually spending quite a bit of time on it
7872243 the big issue is how long will mining companies keep spending on exploration drilling if commodities start turning south
7872244 they were pretty confident of achieving that guidance despite the headwinds out there
7872245 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7872246 its a little bit difficult because there are 50 years of embedded tradition where utilities like anonymity in what they do and how they do it
7872247 i agree more with the bhp model that its better to have a london metal exchange like mark to market transaction but i also see some difficulty there
7872248 we are currently forecasting 148 million and thus envisage downgrading our forecasts this comes only eight weeks after valad provided a business update and their expectation that they would grow 2008 09 earnings
7872249 an unprecedented rise in the price of both crude oil and refining margins took the gloss off what would otherwise have been a record result

7872276 now that i am back i will never ever retire no matter what i will simply fade away one day
7872277 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law

7872280 el problema del mal ser la cuesti n fundamental de la vida intelectual de la posguerra en europa
7872281 el demonio forma parte de nuestra experiencia nuestra generaci n le ha visto lo suficiente como para tomarse el mensaje muy en serio sostengo que el mal no es contingente no es la ausencia o la deformaci n o la subversi n de la virtud o de lo que consideremos su opuesto sino un hecho obstinado e irredimible
7872282 el mayor peligro de considerar el totalitarismo como la maldici n del siglo ser a obsesionarnos con l hasta el punto de ser ciegos a los numerosos males menores y no tan menores con los que est empedrado el camino al infierno
7872283 we think the vast majority of dispensaries in california will be in compliance
7872284 but what do you do you move on and get better
7872285 it will be a good opportunity to show what they can do
7872286 i think the tape will sway us one way or the other or keep us on whoever we thought was going to be there in the first place
7872287 but it wont be anything like 2002 larry allen got hurt that year and we must have used five guys and some of them were coming off the street now that was hard
7872288 texas is a very polished team that has great talent
7872289 texas has never been a tough team a physically tough team
7872290 and thats what weve got to be when my defense will get to the point where i think it will get well be mean nasty ornery bastards and thats what you need to beat texas
7872291 we cant match up with them in talent so we have to match up with them in some other way
7872292 thats not their long suit its probably not the long suit of most teams that have a lot of talent
7872293 thats everybody not just florida atlantic so were going to go out and play the best game we can
7872294 he was great to me and i build a lot of confidence from that guy
7872295 i learned a lot from him hes a great guy a great teammate and im going to miss him
7872296 if we were three games out we wouldnt be in a position to trade a veteran but thats the reality of our situation right now
7872297 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7872298 were here tonight just like you because were ready for change
7872299 for personal reasons the gay cause is certainly important to me
7872300 ive been a democrat tried and true for a long long long time and involved in democratic party politics and i just feel very comfortable coming there
7872301 the sort of underlying theme that drives me is that i hope to show that the democratic party is truly the party of inclusion and truly the party of diversity and when they openly invite me and im out i think they say we are the party of change we are the party of the future
7872302 itll have definite benefits on the drought stricken areas but its not going to end the drought
7872303 and there is a potential of hitting the gulf coast
7872304 if it does go across the area of the drought it could be beneficial
7872305 if it goes back to florida it could cause more flooding
7872306 certainly going to go a long way to making an improvement that we havent seen in quite some time
7872307 the timeframe really isnt theirs it belongs more to the canadian food inspection agency
7872308 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7872309 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
7872310 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7872311 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7872312 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7872313 you can see that people are more scared in general
7872314 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
7872315 it would be a huge hit to our community culturally economically our businesses our people a huge hit
7872316 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7872317 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7872318 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7872319 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7872320 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7872321 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7872322 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7872323 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7872324 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7872325 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7872326 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7872327 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7872328 how cool would it be to be driving a car powered by carp
7872329 its hard to see a fish wasted when there are people in the world that are starving and could use the food

7872333 it was this week in 1814 british troops set fire to the white house did you know that
7872334 the white house was saved it was saved thanks to the actions of one brave young soldier john mccain
7872335 you forgot when i warned the people about the british coming
7872336 i know you have been asking about who i want to be as my running mate
7872337 now wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time who could i be referring to
7872338 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness
7872339 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7872340 if you look at the value of announced projects there is enough momentum to keep growth chugging along despite the dramatic weakening in consumer spending
7872341 there is no real evidence of a downscaling or scrapping of planned projects this year due to power constraints
7872342 the trend is still down but its more moderate it points to an economic slowdown

7872401 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7872402 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

7872416 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7872417 screen for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults with sustained blood pressure either treated or untreated greater than 135 80 mm hg
7872418 current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening in asymptomatic adults with blood pressure of 135 80 mm hg or lower
7872419 the uspstf recommends screening for type 2 diabetes in adults with hypertension or hyperlipidemia
7872420 the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely screening asymptomatic adults for type 2 diabetes impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose

7872422 the long term effect on morbidity and mortality should be assessed in future trials
7872423 for frail older adults persons with life expectancy of less than 5 years and others in whom the risks of intensive glycemic control appear to outweigh the benefits a less stringent target such as 8 is appropriate
7872424 peak postprandial less than 180 mg dl grade b recommendation
7872425 critically ill patients between 80 to 110 mg dl grade a recommendation
7872426 critically ill patients blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg dl 6 1 mmol l as possible and generally
7872427 non critically ill patients there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose
7872428 due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets
7872429 intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg per deciliter reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit
7872430 the trial was stopped early for an unexpectedly large treatment effect which can overestimate the efficacy of treatment or result in a false positive finding
7872431 the relative reduction in mortality for a decrease of 50 mg dl in morning glucose levels seems biologically implausible and exceeds that for any other intervention in critically ill patients
7872432 the mortality rate in the control group was much higher than that noted in tertiary care medical centers in the united states on admission to the icu all patients received 200 to 300 g d of intravenous dextrose followed by enteral or parenteral nutrition an unusual practice considering the deleterious effects of parenteral nutrition at least in part the difference in outcomes between the 2 arms in this study might have reflected the harm of maintaining the control group as hyperglycemic rather than the benefit of strict glucose control in the intervention group
7872433 intensive insulin therapy significantly reduced morbidity but not mortality among all patients in the medical icu although the risk of subsequent death and disease was reduced in patients treated for three or more days these patients could not be identified before therapy

7872458 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7872459 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7872460 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7872461 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7872462 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7872463 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7872464 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7872465 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7872466 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7872467 the atp board can confirm that it has regrettably accepted a petition from the bangalore open to suspend the 2008 event due to the local promoters security concerns

7872474 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7872475 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7872476 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7872477 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7872478 everybody knows that sleep is important yet the function of sleep seems like the mythological phoenix
7872479 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7872480 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7872481 online tools like these truly empower those who may be seeking health information for themselves and family caregivers to more easily navigate todays health care options
7872482 consumers can take advantage of these resources in order to maintain their independence as they age and live the most vibrant lives possible
7872483 i dont see the need to move the tanks from the industrial estate to just a few feet away from these homes why dont they just extend the industrial estate site
7872484 not only are the tanks potentially dangerous but presumably more lorries will be using the area and access to the housing estate is poor
7872485 theres also a feeling that the tanks will have a negative visual impact

7872594 the popularity of other apple products particularly the ipod has drawn more users to the apple platform
7872595 as a result you see this halo effect of people buying apple computers in addition to their ipods quantifying the halo effect is difficult but we certainly believe that effect exists

7872598 the main thing is the level of the assistance you get in those stores is phenomenal

7872610 this is great news for canadas birds biodiversity and the cause of wilderness preservation
7872611 two of canadas important bird areas are found within the qaqulluit and akpait nwas announced today this means critical breeding and feeding grounds for millions of migratory birds will be preserved
7872612 we are extremely pleased to see the government take the all important first step of officially designating three new wildlife areas
7872613 with this announcement however should come a commitment to provide the ongoing funding required to properly manage the entire system of national wildlife areas in canada well into the future
7872614 currently nearly 12 million hectares of wilderness are being managed on less than 4 million dollars annually which is a tiny fraction of what is needed to properly address management concerns and protect wildlife populations

7872712 the dresses the women wear intrigues me in 20 years they will be competing in the nude in 1948 we had to make our own uniforms and it was only allowed to be four inches above the knee

7872714 it was an eye opener for me that we only had one girl in the 200m we are entitled to have three but they could only find one girl
7872715 the important thing in the olympic games is not winning but taking part the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well
7872716 its been blown out of all proportion in 1948 organisers did it all in their spare time i remember a bank manager who did it in the evenings they did a great job in terrible circumstances just after wwii
7872717 london should go back to basics the simplicity of the games they should make it more idealistic and not just nation against nation they should try to put over the olympic ideal
7872718 they don t know nor do we i hope we can evolve it our relationship but we aren t seeing any change thus far
7872719 that s not at all true the company is growing and we are bigger now than we were a couple of months ago we adjust our resources accordingly and we have increased our sales group by 600 percent we make adjustments of resources based on market but the report was false
7872720 i think what people forget is that this deal has been in the works for at least a year and what theyve been negotiating is what will googles revenue share be and who will have access to the rich customer data and as more and more carriers recognize that they are a critical component no matter how big the check google writes it s the trojan horse knocking on the door
7872721 in every single case we have carriers moving up the food chain we are expanding with at amp t and really restructuring that relationship and getting close to announcing industry changing news
7872722 being sold out is difficult and it depends on the market in spain we have 90 percent sell out rates and in sweden it s lower and in the u s it s lower it s an evolution of the market
7872723 it s over that but i don t know the exact numbers off the top of my head

7872788 as a widow having two of my children sponsored is really a blessing the assistance we get is already a big help
7872789 as a mother seeing my children grow up to be good individuals is more than enough reward as a volunteer knowing that im able to help even in a small way and getting personal affirmations tells me that im doing the job right and that keeps me motivated

7872797 hay coleccionistas que mantienen estas obras de arte en b vedas de bancos pero es probable que encontremos m s
7872798 sabemos de obras que han sido documentadas y que a n no hemos encontrado
7872799 en ese seminario todos convenimos la necesidad de construir el museo en la zona costera donde se encuentra la biblioteca de alejandr a para mostrar a las actuales y futuras generaciones los vestigios de la civilizaci n grecorromana
7872800 entre las ruinas arqueol gicas sumergidas m s importantes destacan varios palacios entre ellos el de las meditaciones del militar y pol tico romano marco antonio y el de cleopatra destruidos por los terremotos que sacudieron la regi n en los siglos iv vii y xiv

7872810 the help that we receive goes a long way in making significant difference in the lives of our sponsored children most of these are disadvantaged as they lack the basic needs such as education health care and opportunities for promoting self esteem with the support of our wonderful contributors we are able to make life worth living for the children
7872811 my parents make me happy they tell me stories they take care of me the gifts i receive from my sponsor make me happy too my sponsor cares for me like my parents and i am very happy because i have many people who love me
7872812 pero esto lleva a una excesiva comercializaci n y una menor calidad que afecta en la imagen del arte
7872813 el arte chino est pasando por la edad de oro pero se necesitan calidad y nuevos planteamientos para continuar estando presentes en el mundo internacional del arte
7872814 mi abuelo ten a una casa m s o menos donde estamos ahora tras la guerra en 1950 mis padres levantaron la primera f brica produc an vitrinas para tiendas vitra viene de vitrina luego mi madre tuvo la idea de ir comprando tierra pedazo a pedazo a los agricultores
7872815 uno va cambiando y evolucionando no me gusta planificar mi vida prefiero ir vivi ndola
7872816 la pusimos frente al edificio de grimshaw y de repente algo cambi no sabr a decir qu pero aquello era algo nuevo otra cosa y era bueno
7872817 fue una corazonada quer a que gehry hiciera un edificio un museo para mi colecci n de sillas
7872818 grimshaw no pensaba lo mismo no supo ver mi idea tal vez no fuera una idea s lo una intuici n los edificios reaccionaban unos con otros gehry fue amable con el de grimshaw no trat de competir era como tener un edificio barroco y otro minimalista eran distintos pero no discut an a partir de ah fue f cil pensar en edificios diversos
7872819 pero yo no quer a nada que tuviera que ver con nuestra regi n quer a construir una tierra de nadie no una tierra de vitra la idea fue encargar edificios que nunca hubieran podido estar aqu sin nosotros
7872820 tadao ando nunca hab a construido fuera de su pa s y le fascin poder hacerlo
7872821 pens en un pabell n del silencio que es casi kitsch como idea pero luego me pregunt para qu necesit bamos un pabell n del silencio y decid hacer un peque o centro de conferencias que es lo que tenemos

7872823 con un arquitecto estrella ganas algo y pierdes algo la figura del profesional que se vincula a la firma que permanece resolviendo los problemas de la empresa durante a os est desapareciendo la arquitectura se est convirtiendo en una herramienta de comunicaci n eso altera el papel del arquitecto aunque ofrece nuevas oportunidades pero si el arquitecto se pierde en el mensaje los edificios se resienten y dejan de cumplir su funci n fundamental si uno est hoy en singapur y al d a siguiente en londres puede perderse en las traducciones ni el mejor arquitecto firma obras maestras con todos sus trabajos ni siquiera algo tan denostado como la arquitectura espect culo est al alcance de cualquiera hay que saber hacerlo
7872824 el ayuntamiento quer a ponerme una parada delante de la f brica yo pregunt si pod amos hacerla nosotros nos dieron el dinero de una marquesina habitual y pusimos el resto
7872825 me parece un arquitecto ejemplar discreto modesto y brillante es una estrella contra su voluntad es ntegro
7872826 a m me interesa la gente que trata de hacer algo diferente me parece necesario que haya gente que trate de hacer las cosas bien pero lo que me interesa de verdad es quien trata de hacerlas de otra manera no por la novedad sino porque son capaces de ver algo que nadie ha visto antes

7872828 la devoluci n de los objetos nicos y de los duplicados que se extraigan

7872833 es verdad y durante a os nadie ha dicho nada contra este horror gracias al convento de piano por fin todo esto va a ser destruido y convertido en algo mucho m s discreto
7872834 ha habido mucho expolio durante siglos los huaqueros saqueadores de tumbas venden los objetos valiosos a los coleccionistas y a os m s tarde muchas piezas terminan en los museos o en subastas lo que nos duele a los arque logos es que el objeto al quedar separado del yacimiento pierde todas las posibilidades de asociaci n son como las p ginas arrancadas de un libro se puede leer algo pero no se sabe de qu totalidad forma parte
7872835 desde 1987 a 2000 encontramos a tres de los cuatro personajes de la alta jerarqu a el gran se or el sumo sacerdote y la sacerdotisa faltaba uno que es el que hemos hallado ahora en un valle m s al sur el jefe guerrero es una tumba menos suntuosa que las anteriores pero tambi n est en buen estado estamos en un momento de gran expectativa

7872838 lo m s importante de todo esto es que la gente se empieza a dar cuenta de que ser coleccionista de arte antiguo no significa ser m s culto ni que eso te da prestigio hay que mantener una lucha constante contra el tr fico de obras para que no se destruya por completo el patrimonio

7872844 it is that irrational fear probably based upon all the pressures of modern life to keep up our lifestyles with computers ipods tvs cars gas mortgage food clothes and everything else whereby we fear we will lose our jobs become homeless trade aluminum cans for food money and hold up signs on the side of the road hoping for spare change knowing we will never actually work for food
7872845 i was having just such fears when i decided to sponsor a child at children international i have spent a lot of time in foreign countries where there is real poverty even volunteering for years at an orphanage in rural mexico
7872846 i have a soft spot for children in these countries and have ever since my first visit to mexico with my spanish class in 7th grade my father gave me 100 for souvenirs but i quickly gave it all away to the beggars in mexico city before we even got to tasco or acapulco my heart ached for them it was a sight i had never seen in the states and it tore me up then as it does still today
7872847 so in my heart and head i knew in this land of plenty i would never be homeless unless i chose to be
7872848 the letter i received after that tore me up genesis relayed to me that at 14 years old it was the first time in her life she had a bed of her own they sent me photos of all the new items they were able to buy and told me how much it changed their lives
7872849 i am still unsure about my future and my job and what life may bring my way but i do know that as long as i help others i always seem to be provided for myself
7872850 i like the library because i have learned a lot of things and i am doing better at school i was very excited the day i received things for school i was given everything i needed for school
7872851 i would like my sponsor to see how happy i am because of the things i received from him through children international
7872852 it was difficult for me to adjust especially during my first year in high school i was really very shy then
7872853 the leadership trainings helped me to become more confident in sharing my ideas with others mingling with other sponsored kids in various activities helped me develop my social skills more
7872854 more opportunities are open to those who are educated thats why im fortunate to have a sponsor who helps me to continue with my studies
7872855 he was such a nice young man and had kind blue eyes

7872866 it shows how dangerous a single firearm can be when you have multiple people who have access to it it broadens its reach on the street
7872867 theres no good reason why anyone would need to purchase large quantities of handguns all at the same time
7872868 criminal applications or unrecorded resale are the obvious implications of purchasing handguns in bulk
7872869 prohibiting individual handgun purchases to one a month will help curb the number of guns that end up on the street and in the hands of criminals

7872874 russias behaviour cannot be condoned or excused whatever the wisdom of some of georgias actions that is not a justification for an all powerful neighbour to invade a small sovereign country
7872875 russias pretext that it has a right to step in militarily to protect its citizens has chilling echoes from czech history and dangerous implications if it is now the basis of russian policy such a doctrine cannot be allowed to stand
7872876 free and democratic nations are entitled to see their territorial integrity respected
7872877 we are fortunate that our generation grew up as the cold war was passing into the history books and a happier era dawned in which a more cooperative relationship with russia seemed possible we hope it still is
7872878 but we should not forget that the lessons of 1968 apply still in 2008 that we must be strong and vigilant in defence of our values and not look the other way when a small independent country is invaded by its neighbour
7872879 we must use the leverage we have we may need russian gas but russia needs our market

7872904 just give me what i want and no one gets hurt
7872905 why do you want to go out and spend all that money when people are giving it away
7872906 if you are able to reuse something rather than reconfigure it into a new product thats a whole lot better for the environment
7872907 more localities will probably be adding these in the future
7872908 every time you clean youre just moving it from one spot to another
7872909 i went through world war ii and we just made do with everything saved everything and reused things
7872910 its such a shock now the way people spend extravagantly and throw things by the wayside so i really like the idea of reuse it makes so much sense
7872911 its really neat because somebody comes to your house and takes away the stuff you would have to load up and haul off
7872912 i dont think it is the economy per se but rather the cost of gas that has people thinking more about reuse
7872913 people think its funny that you go to the dump and find stuff

7872915 in short while we recognize that we cannot devise a net metering plan that will satisfy everyone we believe that it is time to implement net metering with an eye toward a further evaluation of the efficacy of its use once it has been in place for a period of time
7872916 that these advanced renewable tariffs should be based upon the specific production costs of each particular generation technology include a return comparable to the utilities allowed returns and be fixed over a period of time that allows for full recovery of capital costs
7872917 recognized that advanced renewable tariffs would likely result in increased costs per unit of electrical output compared to utility scale renewable projects but that these costs are justified by the economic and environmental advantages from encouraging distributed small scale generation
7872918 this is significant for south carolina with rising energy costs net metering can further reduce solar customers energy bills by up to 30 percent because those systems can feed more energy into the grid than they could keep in batteries
7872919 i see this giving customers much more of a choice previously you had to get into systems that were pretty complex using net metering you can put up a system that is pretty straightforward and simple
7872920 obviously were very pleased that there are more renewable energy options available in south carolina it is still in its early stages but were encouraged by the response from the utilities and from the public
7872921 in short while we recognize that we cannot devise a net metering plan that will satisfy everyone we believe that it is time to implement net metering with an eye toward a further evaluation of the efficacy of its use once it has been in place for a period of time
7872922 during our first month of the program we had 60 inquiries two customers have signed up and four or five more are in the process it takes time to establish a program like this but were very optimistic about the future of the program

7872925 i estimate 1000 people were there and a lot of elderly people because the keytes had a lot of friends across the generations rev lambert said
7872926 many people were hurting some were still angry and some were just sad but within that we were still able to celebrate these special people
7872927 when i say special i dont mean outstanding they were our grandparents our parents and our neighbours ordinary folks who had been in our community for decades
7872928 all the family were there including margarets mother and brothers rev lambert said
7872929 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7872930 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7872931 forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives
7872932 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and family and to earn a living wage
7872933 in other words people should support bad business models because its more convenient for the businessmen
7872934 frankly as far as im concerned if a webmaster runs a site thats popular enough that the costs become at all significant the onus is on him or her to find ways to cash in on that popularity to keep the site going
7872935 were having a baseball game it costs 75 per ticket and well run your ad for 20 mins on home plate after the game is over people should feel obligated to stay after the game to watch the ad so that we dont have to raise ticket prices to 85
7872936 i am offended by the idea of paying for things with money
7872937 the fact of the matter is they are not going to make a sale
7872938 or better yet why not keep a log of every site you visit that has ads that are blogged come up with a calculation on the impressions you have taken from them with ad block and send the webmasters a check on a monthly basis roughly the payment terms they get that way you can be ethical and get the content you want
7872939 dont visit a site if you dont want to see its ads

7872956 this cheap way of throwing himself at the feet of this lobby aipac harms american interests and encourages violence and terrorism by giving justification to extremist groups such as al qaida
7872957 obama is gambling with his image and the widespread hopes that many had placed on him to change the face of america its relations with the world and getting out of its economic crises stemming from its failed and immoral wars in iraq and afghanistan
7872958 petrodollars are responsible for the killing of american soldiers and israeli citizens how pathetic
7872959 a mere 12 hours after claiming the democratic presidential nomination barack obama appeared before the american israel public affairs committee yesterday and changed himself into an israel hard liner as a pandering performance it was the full monty by a candidate who during the primary had positioned himself to hillary clintons left on matters such as iran yesterday obama who has generally declined to wear an american flag lapel pin wore a joint u s israeli pin and even tried a hebrew phrase on the crowd
7872960 obama brushes off change confetti and reveals empty suit in aipac conference speech
7872961 the whole world knows that east jerusalem holy jerusalem was occupied in 1967 and we will not accept a palestinian state without having east jerusalem as the capital of a palestinian state
7872962 such illusory and biased remarks are unacceptable it is most evident that they are not a particle of truth and are very much divorced from the reality about irans nuclear activities
7872963 well its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
7872964 throughout my entire life there has been injustice and repression in cuba never in my lifetime have the people of cuba known freedom never in the lives of two generations of cubans have the people of cuba known democracy i wont stand for this injustice i will maintain the embargo
7872965 this man who is doubtless from the social and human points of view the most progressive candidate for the us presidency portrays the cuban revolution as anti democratic and lacking in respect for freedom and human rights
7872966 it is the same argument us administrations have used again and again to justify crimes against our country the blockade is an act of genocide i dont want to see us children inculcated with those shameful values
7872967 perilous mix of anti american rhetoric authoritarian government and checkbook diplomacy
7872968 the same false promise as the tried and failed ideologies of the past
7872969 for those looking to see a continuation of destructive us policies in and presumptions toward latin america from an obama administration his speech parroted some of the same bullheaded and divisive language that weve heard too much of already from bush clinton and others before him
7872970 the tenth biggest weekend box office performance of all time
7872971 the world needs another comic book movie like it needs another bush administration but if we must have one more iron man is a swell one to have
7872972 more to offer the world than making things blow up
7872973 i want people to walk away from this movie with a really good impression of the air force like they got about the navy seeing top gun
7872974 air force is going to come off looking like rock stars
7872975 the script will surely have the flyboy brass back at the pentagon trading high fives especially the scene in which iron man dogfights in the high clouds with two f 22 raptors

7872978 haiti its agriculture industry in shambles needs to better feed itself
7872979 within less than two years it became impossible for haitian farmers to compete with what they called miami rice the whole local rice market in haiti fell apart as cheap u s subsidized rice some of it in the form of food aid flooded the market there was violence rice wars and lives were lost
7872980 in the 1980s imported rice poured into haiti below the cost of what our farmers could produce it farmers lost their businesses people from the countryside started losing their jobs and moving to the cities after a few years of cheap imported rice local production went way down
7872981 tens of millions of rice farmers in poor countries find it hard to lift their families out of poverty because of the lower more volatile prices caused by the interventionist policies of other countries
7872982 haiti once the worlds largest exporter of sugar and other tropical produce to europe began importing even sugar from u s controlled sugar production in the dominican republic and florida it was terrible to see haitian farmers put out of work all this sped up the downward spiral that led to this months food riots
7872983 rich countries need to reduce farms subsidies and trade barriers to allow poor countries to generate income with food exports either the world solves the unfair trade system or every time theres unrest like in haiti we adopt emergency measures and send a little bit of food to temporarily ease hunger
7872984 people cant buy food gasoline prices are going up it is very hard for us over here the cost of living is the biggest worry for us no peace in stomach means no peace in the mind i wonder if others will be able to survive the days ahead because things are very very hard
7872985 our country must immediately open emergency canteens to feed the hungry until we can get them jobs for the long run we need to invest in irrigation transportation and other assistance for our farmers and workers
7872986 the beans might last four days the rice will be gone as soon as i get home
7872987 perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years
7872988 perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years
7872989 barack obama is clearly taking that abysmal abc news debate in stride
7872990 at a time of foreign wars economic collapse and environmental peril the cringe worthy first half of the debate focused on such crucial matters as senator obamas comments about rural bitterness his former pastor an obscure sixties radical with whom he was allegedly
7872991 when barack obama met hillary clinton for another televised democratic candidates debate last night it was more than a step forward in the 2008 presidential election it was another step downward for network news in particular abc news which hosted the debate from philadelphia and whose usually dependable anchors charlie gibson and george stephanopoulos turned in shoddy despicable performances

7873016 theyve jumped from generation one to generation four or five
7873017 that figure is sure to rise after adding the tens of billions of dollars in additional iraq war funding it doesnt include and the total could be higher yet if the economy fails to recover as the administration predicts
7873018 the administration actually underestimates the deficit since it leaves out about 80 billion in war costs in a break from tradition and in violation of new mandates from congress the white house did not include its full estimate of war costs

7873020 uneasy is the peace that wears a nuclear crown and we cannot be satisfied with a situation in which the world is capable of extinction in a moment of error or madness or anger
7873021 any legislation should acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us

7873053 one of the major problems with applying existing assessment tools to situations in emerging cultures is that the tools underlying cultural theological and philosophical presuppositions generally dont match with those of the cultures they claim to
7873054 i witnessed an experience of this in 2007 when a church i worked with conducted a congregation wide survey i realized that the survey asked many questions that seemed completely irrelevant
7873055 i found out later that many other people who had been around churches for at least a few decades were equally perturbed by the survey and for similar reasons
7873056 i realize now that the methodological problem was this this tool may have been reliable for the church models of the 1970s and 80s but the world had changed significantly as had church models

7873065 it didnt hit me until i wanted to buy a house
7873066 i got the financial information i needed long after the fact by then i was too scared to even tell my parents

7873079 thats a technology that really doesnt have a commercial need right now because farmers arent needing to map their carbon
7873080 but in a couple of years they may be able to sell soil carbon under a soil carbon sequestration program where they would really need to map beginning levels of carbon and ending levels of carbon we have developed technologies that will enable them to do that cost effectively using near infrared sensing
7873081 with demand for products high and the need to be able to produce as much food and fiber and energy as we can anything we can do to produce more food and more fiber and more energy with the same or even less inputs is going to be good for the farmer environment and basically everybody

7873083 the good news in july was that home sales didnt decline as precipitously as they have in the previous six months of the year
7873084 unfortunately prices dipped even more than they did this past april when prices were 12 percent lower than a year earlier the drop is a dramatic turnaround from five to six years ago when prices were escalating by double digit percentages foreclosure activity has certainly dragged down home prices and will continue to affect the overall market

7873090 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men

7873103 in corporate america and around the world the vast majority of information is being created in an electronically stored format
7873104 fourteen years ago the vast majority was being created on paper theres been a big pendulum shift so a platform that can scale given the ever increasing amounts of electronically stored information is paramount the platform is all scale
7873105 we liked the scale and availability that oracle rac gives you
7873106 unless you go to the mainframe market there is no competitor which has that technology
7873107 we went with oracle rac and you really want to tie that to a san storage solution
7873108 we also have our core data solution on san we store millions and millions of images and put that on network storage nas oracle databases pass links to both types of storage
7873109 we currently have some superstar dbas who know oracle and we had to add from the java open source world as well

7873113 we allow them to take control and we handle multi case documents it all comes to one location one security model
7873114 in corporate america and around the world the vast majority of information is being created in an electronically stored format
7873115 fourteen years ago the vast majority was being created on paper theres been a big pendulum shift so a platform that can scale given the ever increasing amounts of electronically stored information is paramount the platform is all scale
7873116 we liked the scale and availability that oracle rac gives you
7873117 unless you go to the mainframe market there is no competitor which has that technology
7873118 we went with oracle rac and you really want to tie that to a san storage solution
7873119 we also have our core data solution on san we store millions and millions of images and put that on network storage nas oracle databases pass links to both types of storage
7873120 we currently have some superstar dbas who know oracle and we had to add from the java open source world as well
7873121 but the really good engineers like to work on the best technology and in the bay area you have an awesome talent pool
7873122 the base challenge is making the decision to do the re architecture and rebuild the platform from scratch

7873126 an investigation by the associated press ap has revealed that the drinking water of at least 41 million people in the united states is contaminated with pharmaceutical drugs to determine the extent of drinking water contamination an associated press investigative team surveyed the water providers of the 50 largest cities in the united states and 52 smaller communities analyzed federal databases and scientific reports and interviewed government and corporate officials the investigation found widespread evidence of drinking water contaminated with both over the counter and prescription drugs including painkillers hormones antibiotics anti convulsants anti depressants and drugs for cancer or heart disease of the 28 major cities that tested their water supplies for pharmaceuticals only two said those tests showed no pharmaceutical contamination
7873127 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7873128 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7873129 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7873130 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7873131 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7873132 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why

7873159 on hearing the broadcast the commission was of the view that the line of questioning by the presenter and his comment on the response from aig europe ireland ltd to the programme constitutes unfairness

7873231 we came all the way from chicago like somebody else you know
7873232 when you bump into biden make sure you tell him that
7873233 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7873234 the work ahead is to get that verification mechanism and therefore to proceed with denuclearization
7873235 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7873236 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying
7873237 i hope north korea will resume disablement measures at an early date
7873238 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7873239 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more

7873246 last year the world got hit by a heroin tsunami almost 700 tonnes this year the opium flood waters have started to recede
7873247 if hilmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7873248 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7873249 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together
7873250 governors need to be able to deliver on their promises aid should be disbursed more quickly without the transaction costs of national and international bureaucracy
7873251 the international community should help afghanistan tackle its massive cannabis problem
7873252 afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and the latest food crisis has made farmers even more vulnerable opium is a seasonal plant it may be gone today but back again tomorrow
7873253 this must be done now while farmers are deciding whether or not to plant opium for the 2008 09 harvest timely and targeted international assistance is vital
7873254 these provinces particularly daykundi and zabul are ripe for the same kind of success that we witnessed in badakshan and nangarhar this year lets make them opium free in 2009
7873255 these are higher value targets than farmers fields if heroin processing and trafficking are blocked the domestic price of opium would drop even further
7873256 such an inelastic response suggests that vast amounts of opium heroin and morphine thousand of tonnes have been withheld from the market
7873257 where is this opium who is stockpiling it and why this is a ticking time bomb for public health and global security
7873258 corrupt officials landowners warlords and criminals must feel the full force of the law otherwise the opium economy will continue to operate with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7873259 i am disappointed that so far neither afghanistan nor any other un member states have come forward with any names
7873260 preventing these chemicals from reaching afghanistan will make heroin production a much riskier and costlier business

7873262 this is perhaps one of the most important elections weve seen in history between the two parties there is such a dramatic difference between the two parties

7873264 we now have a reputation around the world as a violator of human rights and in the past weve been the champion of human rights were the biggest impediment to dealing with our global climate change we have initiated now a policy of going to war even when our nations security is not threatened a completely unnecessary war
7873265 one thing we realized from this accident is that the turnpike is a cut through the mountains
7873266 its very heavily traveled by commerce trucks and cars and there are very few alternate routes
7873267 that fact is this accident unified all of these emergency responders to realize that weve got to be able to do better
7873268 its just that we have to have a good plan we have to have communications and we have to exercises so we can execute that plan
7873269 hello are you lost can i help you find something

7873334 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7873335 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7873336 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7873337 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7873338 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7873339 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

7873351 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion if i feel i need to be hard with someone in order to get that across i will and if i feel i need to be softer and more nurturing with the contestants ill do that it all depends on the situation
7873352 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see

7873363 the san francisco municipal transportation agency is developing details in the next few months and will implement the program for city employees soon said the agencys director nathaniel ford
7873364 claiming that the bicycle plan should be subject to environmental review because it makes physical changes to the citys streetscape
7873365 the group cited the california environmental quality act which requires public projects to undergo a review if they might alter the environment in order to come into compliance with ceqa the city must either conduct an environmental impact review or become exempt from the process

7873367 a shared public bicycle scheme similar to a city bike initiative in denmark is set to be introduced in melbourne government documents show
7873368 the system would be similar to a scheme in copenhagen which has had a free
7873369 in copenhagen cyclists put a coin in a deposit box and may then take a bicycle for as long as wanted so long as it is returned to one of 110 city bike racks it cannot be taken outside the city centre
7873370 a spokeswoman for the city confirmed yesterday the transport department was working on the bicycle scheme to be in place by the end of this year

7873372 far from giving up on the idea portland commissioner sam adams office says just theyre taking a new approach
7873373 adams transportation policy staffer shoshanah oppenheim told me that once they began to delve into the meat of the responses to their request for proposals rfp which was sent out on july 17 2007 it was clear we needed to do more analysis

7873376 mayor martin ch vez said he plans to have 500 bicycles in more than 25 kiosks throughout the city by early next summer

7873428 our staff has reported promising preliminary results from the first 5 cubic yard semi mechanical gravel washing which has recovered 8 8 grams of gold nuggets the secondary concentration has not yet been factored into the final results which are anticipated to reflect an additional 55 of fine gold because the additional secondary circuit recovery components are still being setup these results indicate approximately 1 75 grams per ton before secondary fine recovery processes this is consistent with the conclusions of our 43 101 geological report we are pleased with these findings
7873429 sufficient gravel volumes and resources in the order of 2 000 to 4 000 kg 65 000 to 130 000 oz of recoverable gold to eventually sustain a profitable mechanized mining operation with annual gold production of 625 to 1 100 kg
7873430 considering the relatively high stripping ratio of the area a minimum recoverable grade of 2 0 gr m3 au should be expected
7873431 incidentally mr mike stewart a shareholder of the company recently returned from a site visit in guinea and was on location during the gold recovery
7873432 i witnessed approximately 8 grams of gold being recovered from the 5 yards of gravel being processed the staff stated that they were only able to recover about 30 45 of the gold in the first stage of recovery because the additional fine recovery processes were not yet in place it was explained that the balance would be recovered after the remaining gravel had been crushed screened and re circulated

7873436 we are positioning maestro into a newly emerging gold region with our latest acquisition of star point and now twin springs ss
7873437 we have several very active neighbors including midway gold who is drilling at their spring valley project golden predator newmont and fronteer development group ss has the characteristics of a large multi age epithermal au system hosted in triassic limestone rocks
7873438 twin springs ss represents another great opportunity for a company maker discovery in an area that is emerging as one of nevadas new area plays
7873439 particularly as we watch the consolidation of companies in the district and new drill results from all the active players here based on my field visit it is apparent that twin springs ss is a very large mineral system mineralization is spread in sub crop over a large area and the project has abundant north south and northeast trending structural controls which are both prolific trends in this region

7873444 janice lived there 24 7 she was in for the full run i really cant think of anybody else who really would do that along with the cast of a reality show i almost think it was harder for the kids to be in the house than it was for janice to be there
7873445 the models do not know theyre being observed by me 24 7 so they cant get away with what they think they can get away with
7873446 you will see as the show progresses that not in a million years did they suspect that janice herself was having the same access as the producers have being able to go into the bedroom hit a button thats hidden inside of a mannequin and really be in the know and see everything the models were doing and really be able to watch it unedited and raw the same way we do we werent filtering anything for janice it really worked out well
7873447 her relationship with them is very real and very genuine and shes very much in their lives on every level
7873448 i think people mistakenly think that janice is this over the top caricature i think that youre really going to see this very den mother side of janice that i dont think were used to seeing its actually very moving and very real
7873449 these guys got rejected on the third season so theyre not there we have a new flock
7873450 they were eliminated because they were so physically fit i love their relationship because that was the best part of their storyline but it was just hard to explore without them getting a lot of jobs

7873470 there is such a fear of women coming into power that when they protest they are given more weight
7873471 just the fact of women saying they support their candidate and want to make their voices heard sounds more scary than it would be if it were guys thats just part of backlash but come on when women gather around a water fountain men get scared people oughta just chill
7873472 we are in the middle of a revolution women are stepping up and taking power
7873473 e n van de eerste lps die ik kocht was thats soul uit 1967 daar stond burke al tussen artiesten als aretha franklin en otis redding hij is n van de weinigen die het al die tijd heeft volgehouden en is ongelofelijk sympathiek en gul bij amerikanen is dat nog wel eens for the time being maar solomon onthoudt alles laatst speelde hij op een festival in het belgische peer waar ik hem heb opgezocht solomon verwachtte ons al daar zat hij in zn bouwkeet in de polder geen centje pijn prinsheerlijk jools holland was er ook die zat daar te tokkelen op zn gitaar je voelt je meteen op je gemak omdat je allemaal met muziek bezig bent
7873474 wel verleggen we onze muzikale grenzen het kan ons steeds minder schelen wat voor stijl we spelen twintig jaar geleden zouden we ons daar nog wel druk over maken we waren immers een rhythm amp blues band nu noemen we het gewoon volksmuziek als je ouder wordt laat je je minder dicteren hoe het zou moeten je vaart meer je eigen koers in onze begintijd konden we nachtenlang bakkeleien of een bepaald akkoord nu mineur of majeur moest zijn
7873475 wat ons betreft gaan we nog vijfentwintig jaar door ze vragen ons wel eens wordt het niet te zwaar het tegendeel is waar we hebben zoveel ervaring dat de lol alleen maar groter wordt
7873476 dat is vanwege het feit dat we al enkele keren in suriname zijn geweest we komen er graag

7873478 ik hoop ik na 28 jaar niet meer hetzelfde doe als de eerste keer ook nu gaan sommige nummers over de liefde maar niet meer vanuit het perspectief van een jongeman die elke zaterdagavond wanhopig op zoek is naar de liefde van zn leven of de liefde van n weekend ik ben een getrouwde man heb een dochter van 21 over di liefde gaan mijn teksten nu door simpelweg te leven en te blijven leven
7873479 ik heb een verdraagzame wereld in mn hoofd waarin mensen elkaar het licht in de ogen gunnen met respect voor elkaar de omgeving de natuur zo simpel als wat eigenlijk maar het blijkt nogal moeilijk te zijn om dat voor elkaar te krijgen of ik een boodschap mee wil geven in mn teksten boodschappen doe je bij de c1000
7873480 dat is niet meer waarom ik het doe niet alles is meer even belangrijk de eerste platen getuigden van een ongebreidelde kwaadheid iedereen had t gedaan en de amerikanen natuurlijk voorop dat zit er nog steeds wel in maar je leert ook je pijlen beter te richten je schiet niet meer de hele bos tegelijk af maar als het de mensen een hart onder de riem steekt graag

7873492 i was speculating the outcome the altantuyas murder trial bit by bit it was beginning to unravel the climax of the ending from my view it seems like it was beginning to end like i was predicted only with a little twist and turn of events
7873493 the last few days weve had people indicating that maybe these guys were railroaded
7873494 i just want to make the point that this was not one isolated incident but really was a series of issues when you have two violations within a matter of months it would appear that something is seriously amiss
7873495 you turn around and take an airplane ticket and perform on a porn site for money and it was pretty automatic at that point that we couldnt go forward
7873496 certainly as a general guideline you dont want to have any behavior that would embarrass their team the university or the athletic department and that covers an awful lot of ground
7873497 nobody wants to see anybody get hurt but the overall effect on the industry would be devastating
7873498 it is a lot of red tape and unduly burdensome on small businesses and sas safety record is reasonably good in residential construction
7873499 the moment it went through we would need to lift our prices for a 150 000 home by somewhere between 10 000 and 20 000
7873500 if you knew worksafe was going to start policing it the moment it was proclaimed we would have to make sure that we were covered
7873501 this will add significant cost to building a new home or undertaking improvements and i dont see the logic of having to apply practices that have been in place in nsw and have seriously impacted on affordability in that state
7873502 its just not so theres just no evidence to show that in any form
7873503 instead of working off rusty old 44 gallon drums and orange crates you find yourself in a stable work environment then you can actually do your job
7873504 its our view that besides making it safer it will actually make it more productive
7873505 but at the same time if one person is saved because of 10 000 is that too much to ask

7873556 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognised borders of georgia and are going to remain so
7873557 as to the russian apparent intention to recognise two parts i think it is regrettable
7873558 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party

7873560 i estimate 1000 people were there and a lot of elderly people because the keytes had a lot of friends across the generations rev lambert said

7873565 they were lying on the ground no broken wings or injuries you would ex pect to see if they were struck by these large blades

7873601 unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god
7873602 yes use the gospel to decide who is going to be in the church and who is not why add more to it plain and simple the bible is the lectio divina and if we believe it great if we do not you are not the church
7873603 various communities throughout church history have often developed new creeds and confessions in order to express the gospel in their cultural context
7873604 no persoon should allow themselves to be ordanied by any church in which they dont believe in its creed a lot of the time they become ordanined and then try to change the creeds to what they believe
7873605 as far as using a creed to help you in your scriptural interpretation that is the role of the holy spirit
7873606 while it is nice to think all we need is the bible the truth is that even sincere christians can read the same verse and understand it very differently if after careful study someone comes to a firm conviction on an important but non essential doctrine he will want to associate himself with a congregation and or denomination that believes as he believes

7873609 how difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of god
7873610 children how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of god 25 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god
7873611 with man it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god
7873612 why do you call me good no one is good except god alone
7873613 why do you ask me no one gives eternal life except god alone

7873629 the vast majority of reported crime was as a result of the stop and search powers we were using although we had a few assaults reported they werent serious
7873630 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
7873631 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground these were officers who had been working hard all day
7873632 this has been an unattractive affair my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7873633 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7873634 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7873635 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true

7873645 die mannschaft ist stark hat gute einzelspieler ag ero ist wieder dabei er hat bei olympia seine klasse unter beweis gestellt
7873646 wir d rfen nicht so wie in porto nur verteidigen das hat uns sehr in not gebracht wir m ssen die chancen nutzen die wir bekommen werden und dann mindestens ein tor erzielen
7873647 wir freuen uns vielmehr auf die partie zeigen wir die ausw rtsleistungen wie in barcelona oder in valencia werden wir eine runde weiterkommen
7873648 dann bekommen wir probleme wenn man 90 minuten nur hinten drin steht passiert irgendwann ein fehler und es f llt ein tor
7873649 es muss alles zusammenpassen wir m ssen k mpfen laufen und spielen

7873667 this is an argument i have with myself a lot because i really hate political statements coming from bands i feel like the last person i want to hear you know a philosophy from is someone whose one credential is that they can play the guitar
7873668 on the other hand its good to have bands like rage against the machine who no matter whether or not you think theyre a bunch of fools who are trapped in freshmen year of university are at least speaking their minds and like trying to make a difference although were they spouting fascist ideas then wed all be condemning them
7873669 limbs contort faces stretch and opponents go flying across the ring
7873670 the reason we went with that direction is aircell doesnt work for us going to mexico alaska or hawaii
7873671 we wanted a service that we could really offer anywhere
7873672 its huge from an operational opportunity for things you can do
7873673 anywhere our employees engage with customers we have a network presence except in the air
7873674 so the customer service things that would be possible if the company decides to do them could be pretty impressive
7873675 obama has gone negative so much for the politics of change
7873676 weve never felt this issue was something that would affect our long term business in the sense that were a policy enforcement platform that can comply with a wide range of policy directions and or regulations as it relates to what are reasonable and unreasonable policies
7873677 this order probably eliminates some of the uncertainty about what service providers might want to do
7873678 is oriented toward identifying the sources of congestion in a non applicaton specific way and applies policies to address that congestion to ensure fair use and fair access to network resources by a broad mix of users
7873679 weve always said it the delay would be a matter of minutes
7873680 our solution is not simply a single function single operation device it can be used in a variety of fashions
7873681 youd want detailed measurement of usage and to apply that data usage in sophisticated fashion
7873682 there remains a limit to the available talent that can be hired to pursue the rapid increase in interactive marketing communications programs that customers are demanding
7873683 in order to meet that need agency holding companies and other marketing communications businesses are going to have to acquire businesses agencies that possess those skills
7873684 youd have to believe its a bit of an ugly thing for microsoft to sell at that price not that they cant withstand it
7873685 and if thats the case the idea of an asset swap might be useful to mask some of the value questions
7873686 wpp as a whole has a whole lot of bargaining power if creative minds got together
7873687 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations

7873690 default is a real possibility and the capacity to meet financial commitments is vulnerable to deterioration in business and economic conditions
7873691 acceleration of declines in newspaper advertising revenue and cash flow at tribune and no evidence from any participants in the industry regarding the prospects for current pressure relenting over the longer term fitch continues to anticipate that the company will be challenged to generate meaningful and consistent revenue growth and remains cautious regarding newspaper companies prospects for capturing and monetizing the significant volume of advertising dollars that are migrating toward the internet
7873692 while the second half of 2008 should be favorable for the broadcasting division fitch expects 2009 to be a weak year for tv broadcasting stations particularly those affiliated with lower rated networks e g the cw network
7873693 while the company could receive an amendment or waiver from the banks if it breaches a covenant in this credit environment fitch is uncertain and cautious regarding the terms of such a potential negotiation for such a highly leveraged entity with deteriorating prospects
7873694 adding helios differentiated postpaid offer to virgin mobile usas existing portfolio will expand both our market opportunity and our ability to deliver new products and services more rapidly
7873695 we believe this transformative transaction will bolster our leading position in the wireless space and enable us to provide customers with whatever they need in wireless always with our focus on great value flexibility and customer service
7873696 this acquisition of helio also comes with a number of financial benefits including improved network rates from sprint for virgin mobile usa and strategic investments by sk telecom and virgin group which improve our capital structure and increase liquidity
7873697 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7873698 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7873699 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7873700 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7873701 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7873702 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
7873703 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
7873704 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
7873705 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
7873706 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter
7873707 aarons father fought in the korean war and he has tons of experience in reporting
7873708 we are really going for places we feel we can have an impact and cover them in ways that are slightly different
7873709 we want to be the number one independent news source on the internet
7873710 google sollte sich nicht daran beteiligen dass nun ein digitaler pranger wieder eingef hrt wird
7873711 i tried to steer him away from the broadcasters because of the difficulty you have in taking on broadcasters in spectrum matters
7873712 what our next generation communications program is looking at is developing the technologies that could dynamically redistribute the allocated spectrum where the radios and equipment would listen to see if the spectrum is being used and if not use it
7873713 the prototype tests up to this point have consistently shown failure
7873714 that doesnt give us a whole lot of comfort when theres a potential of thousands or millions of these devices operating without any protection to ensure that our broadcasters are able to get clear picture to our viewers
7873715 the truth of the matter is if this were a straight engineering consideration you could do substantially higher than
7873716 this is a political situation as well as the question as to what is comfortable for the fcc
7873717 it takes them a while to realize we have something here
7873718 there werent many models where you could go to do this i did it intuitively i have four people in the office and five people at the house and i dont even have a job why it takes that many people to sustain me is hard to explain they have been with me for a long time which makes things run smoothly because they know my habits and predilections
7873719 family offices come in all different kinds of sizes shapes and flavors
7873720 its usually dictated by what a family wants and the skill set they need to run their office

7873735 they rotate them pretty evenly both quaterbacks are stepping up in the pocket and making plays passing game is looking real good
7873736 what sets the truly successful business apart from the businesses relegated to compete on price
7873737 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7873738 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7873739 hank we can make it if we go on a run
7873740 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months
7873741 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
7873742 aujourdhui nous sommes un leader global avec la capacit de servir nos clients peu importe leur taille leur position g ographique et leur secteur avec lun des plus tendus et des plus comp titifs portefeuilles dans lindustrie
7873743 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7873744 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7873745 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7873746 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7873747 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7873748 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7873749 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7873750 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
7873751 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
7873752 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
7873753 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
7873754 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
7873755 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
7873756 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7873757 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7873758 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7873759 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7873760 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7873761 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7873762 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7873763 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
7873764 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
7873765 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7873766 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7873767 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
7873768 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
7873769 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
7873770 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
7873771 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
7873772 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
7873773 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
7873774 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
7873775 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7873776 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7873777 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7873778 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
7873779 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
7873780 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
7873781 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
7873782 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
7873783 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
7873784 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
7873785 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7873786 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
7873787 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
7873788 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
7873789 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
7873790 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
7873791 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
7873792 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
7873793 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

7873810 que las diferencias de sueldos se hacen insostenibles y que no es posible que las remuneraciones m s bajas y m s altas entre los trabajadores se hayan acrecentado en vez de haberse acortado
7873811 mayores niveles de igualdad en las remuneraciones o m s bien dicho hay que lograr menores niveles de desigualdad
7873812 es falso decir que vamos a llegar a un nivel de total igualdad en las remuneraciones pero no podemos abandonar el objetivo de que la brecha se tiene que ir estrechando y no ampliando y por eso en la discusi n de la pr xima ley de presupuesto pediremos que se congelen las remuneraciones altas de los funcionarios p blicos mientras no haya un crecimiento importante de las m s bajas
7873813 me suena a chantaje esta propuesta que ha hecho sebastian pi era porque en la c mara de diputados se trabaj durante varios meses con parlamentarios de rn y la udi as como tambi n de la concertaci n por parte del ministro cort zar hab an llegado a un acuerdo y por una raz n inexplicable no se cumpli y decidieron votar como lo hicieron
7873814 llegar a un acuerdo con sebasti n pi era significar a tener la certeza de los votos porque hemos visto otras iniciativas legales en estos ltimos meses que contaban con su respaldo y han sido rechazadas como la inscripci n autom tica la reforma constitucional para poner fin a la exclusi n y el derecho a voto de los chilenos en el exterior entonces habr a que ver si un eventual acuerdo obliga o no a los parlamentarios de la derecha

7873816 si en 1988 nos hubi ramos permitido las licencias de hoy nunca hubi ramos derrotado a pinochet
7873817 eso me parece grave y delicado porque s lo genera un atrincheramiento entre las fuerzas pol ticas y no contribuye a mejorar el clima m s bien se parece a un ejercicio de enlace pol tico al interior de la concertaci n
7873818 si hacemos un s mil militar y se compara una reuni n normal de los militantes de un partido pol tico con un ejercicio de enlace significa que las dos listas de candidatos a concejales que propiciaron el ppd y el prsd son un golpe de estado
7873819 actitud permanente de gente del ppd muy influyente como el senador girardi quien es un accionista importante de ese partido que ha llevado a que nunca se sabe si est n en el gobierno o en la oposici n

7873821 el subsidio al transporte en todo chile es una necesidad como ocurre en la mayor a de los pa ses nosotros como democracia cristiana creemos que este debe extenderse a los taxis taxis colectivos y al transporte escolar sobre todo en este ltimo caso porque la mayor a de las personas que se dedican a el son mujeres jefas de hogar que han sufrido con el alza del petr leo una merma en sus ingresos
7873822 la existencia de diferentes liderazgos habla bien de la coalici n me siento contenta por sergio l es un gran amigo le tengo cari o y lo har a estupendo as que fant stico
7873823 como democracia cristiana hemos definido un camino y nos apegaremos a el primero debemos comenzar por casa para luego tomar las definiciones que correspondan al interior de la concertaci n siempre con el prop sito de que sea un o una de las nuestras quien encabece el proceso de la coalici n para llegar a la moneda en 2010
7873824 se les consult a los parlamentarios en sus regiones y circunscripciones y luego fueron a una comisi n seleccionadora encabezada por el camarada jorge burgos donde participaron destacad simos camaradas como belisario velasco que est trabajando con eduardo frei y una vez que se aprobaba ah iban al consejo y del consejo forman parte los senadores as es que no creo que exista la posibilidad de esa carta

7873831 soy partidaria que se regulen por ley todas las asignaciones que reciben los ministros de estado as como las de los parlamentarios esto debe hacerse de acuerdo a la ley de presupuesto que es una discusi n p blica y la gente debe tener acceso a esa informaci n
7873832 no me parece que pueda haber una asignaci n o un incremento de remuneraci n sin que se discuta como se discuten todos los recursos p blicos se tiene que regular cu nto van a ganar los parlamentarios y a que se destinan las asignaciones la transparencia es lo m s importante
7873833 la gente debe saber cual es el patrimonio de cada parlamentario y en que sectores tiene intereses la derecha se ha opuesto permanentemente a regular el ejercicio de la funci n parlamentaria ha impedido que se restrinja que los parlamentarios cumplan otras funciones como la de abogado est re ido con la tica que un parlamentario un senador de la rep blica ejerza como abogado cuando forma parte del sistema de designaci n de los jueces de la corte suprema no se puede dedicar medio d a al parlamento y medio d a a los negocios

7874008 we are positioning maestro into a newly emerging gold region with our latest acquisition of star point and now twin springs ss
7874009 we have several very active neighbors including midway gold who is drilling at their spring valley project golden predator newmont and fronteer development group ss has the characteristics of a large multi age epithermal au system hosted in triassic limestone rocks
7874010 twin springs ss represents another great opportunity for a company maker discovery in an area that is emerging as one of nevadas new area plays
7874011 particularly as we watch the consolidation of companies in the district and new drill results from all the active players here based on my field visit it is apparent that twin springs ss is a very large mineral system mineralization is spread in sub crop over a large area and the project has abundant north south and northeast trending structural controls which are both prolific trends in this region

7874016 our staff has reported promising preliminary results from the first 5 cubic yard semi mechanical gravel washing which has recovered 8 8 grams of gold nuggets the secondary concentration has not yet been factored into the final results which are anticipated to reflect an additional 55 of fine gold because the additional secondary circuit recovery components are still being setup these results indicate approximately 1 75 grams per ton before secondary fine recovery processes this is consistent with the conclusions of our 43 101 geological report we are pleased with these findings
7874017 sufficient gravel volumes and resources in the order of 2 000 to 4 000 kg 65 000 to 130 000 oz of recoverable gold to eventually sustain a profitable mechanized mining operation with annual gold production of 625 to 1 100 kg
7874018 considering the relatively high stripping ratio of the area a minimum recoverable grade of 2 0 gr m3 au should be expected
7874019 incidentally mr mike stewart a shareholder of the company recently returned from a site visit in guinea and was on location during the gold recovery
7874020 i witnessed approximately 8 grams of gold being recovered from the 5 yards of gravel being processed the staff stated that they were only able to recover about 30 45 of the gold in the first stage of recovery because the additional fine recovery processes were not yet in place it was explained that the balance would be recovered after the remaining gravel had been crushed screened and re circulated

7874027 many companies today still rely on slow manual processes that offer only limited visibility
7874028 this lack of visibility leaves them exposed to risk when events requiring rapid change occur our study shows most companies are taking a reactive approach to risk as opposed to a proactive approach that could help minimize the impact of disruption and protect bottom line results early in the cycle
7874029 as companies initiate new overseas sourcing programs they face a number of barriers and heightened complexity currencies customs and time zones are just a few forms of risk to be addressed increased complexity of transactions requires companies to change the way they view and assess supply chain risk a holistic approach that includes all supply chain parties involved in the process and identifies potential weak points can protect the bottom line
7874030 online shoppers want to capitalize on and benefit from the experiences of other consumers so they can make smarter purchasing decisions
7874031 people believe the experiences told by other shoppers because they feel the opinions are less biased than other sources a customer has nothing to gain from promoting a good service or product so positive feedback can carry a lot of weight in addition cautionary tales from other consumers can be a powerful influence as well
7874032 weve designed our site around the fact that online shoppers value each others recommendations and benefit from their shared research our members post consumer related stories that help one another make more informed purchasing decisions
7874033 additionally we maintain a comprehensive personally selected collection of retailers and products that we manually link to relevant stories making it easy for shoppers to find the items being discussed members can review these retailers and products so they have an additional sense of assurance about their quality members can also save lists of their favorite retailers and products to share with other shoppers
7874034 and by giving members a voice we found that everyone benefits from their shared experiences

7874055 for many years piracy was simply robbery but now it has changed

7874063 infosys proposed take over of axon group may be a tad expensive and not exactly be a value buy but it is a better investment than making cash sit idle in your balance sheet this should essentially take the pressure off the management and give them the elbow room to now look at better fitting plays something that they had been avoiding so far
7874064 infosys values axon at nearly 2 times cy07 revenues and about 20 times cy07 earnings which is fair in our view axons revenues and pat have grown by 43 and 68 cagr respectively over the past 5 years albeit partly due to acquisitions

7874119 american citizens from every state have played heroic and indispensable roles in responding to hurricane katrina
7874120 and in return this response demonstrated the power of a robust national service program that can support these volunteers and provide sustained intensive service national service programs and the volunteers they support have given hope and help to millions of gulf residents and we remain committed to the recovery effort
7874121 as we think about the future its important to remember some of the great acts of compassion that took place
7874122 katrina was a defining moment for national service and the large volunteer sector and we are very proud of the way americans answered the call to serve
7874123 but the job is not done and we need more volunteers there are still schools to repair houses to build children who need teachers and people with health needs gulf coast organizations are better positioned than ever and we encourage you to get involved

7874165 i said to her im very sorry then she blew up

7874168 i have said nobody can stop me from mourning my brother maureen cannot stop me
7874169 se diamo forza al risultato ne esce male perch la supercoppa lha vinta linter se guardiamo altre cose io ho visto una squadra che riuscita a ribaltare una prima parte iniziale difficile dove linter ha fatto meglio nel secondo tempo lha riportata in parit nei supplementari la poteva aver chiusa e ai rigori si era ricreata la possibilit di vincere poi lha vinta linter nel complesso la roma ne esce a testa alta ha messo a posto delle situazioni che lo scorso anno non andavano bene anche nei calci di rigori la squadra ha dimostrato personalit sono stati battuti tutti bene in porta cerano due portieri nazionali
7874170 queste sono cose che si guardano allinterno mi fa piacere che lui voglia ripartire dalle cose sbagliate
7874171 secondo me per quelle che sono le caratteristiche bisogna puntare su quello che pi possibile prendere per questo non possiamo dare un nome preciso possiamo stare tranquilli perch i giocatori che abbiamo sono molto bravi e sanno interpretare pi situazioni a me serve la mentalit della squadra soprattutto
7874172 nel primo tempo hanno fatto bene hanno fatto vedere di saper mettere in pratica le cose hanno fatto un buon pressing aggredivano lo spazio per indurre lerrore noi forse abbiamo sbagliato qualcosa di troppo rispetto alle nostre qualit comunque ho visto una buona squadra soprattutto nel secondo tempo non ci sono state molte differenze tra linter di mourinho e quella di mancini ce la siamo giocata con entrambe
7874173 tutta la squadra andata meglio siamo ripartiti da l siamo ripartiti dal secondo tempo
7874174 no loro prima hanno fatto meglio ma non per mancanze nostre tutti hanno dato il loro contributo
7874175 le qualit si sono viste alla fine loro erano molto guardinghi a livello complessivo hanno fatto vedere di essere molto attenti anche alla fase difensiva ma noi siamo riusciti ugualmente ad andare a tu per tu con il portiere
7874176 io non ho visto differenza tra le due squadre se analizzo la partita ho visto due squadre forti con buona mentalit tutte e due volevano vincere la partita se uno la guarda dopo aver saputo il risultato finale le considerazioni si viziano
7874177 si ma un secondo tempo migliore del loro noi si aveva il 90 della possibilit di vincere ai rigori e poi hanno vinto loro le partite sono diverse e si ribaltano in poco
7874178 non un calciatore che fa la differenza un modo di ragionare un modo di allenarsi questa squadra ha vinto quando mancato totti taddei o mancini ah come mai a mourinho nessuno ha chiesto della sostituzione del brasiliano
7874179 punto sempre sul collettivo non faccio nomi conta il gruppo
7874180 francesco ha evidenziato che qualche difficolt ce lha ancora non che gli potessi chiedere di pi mi aspettavo quanto ha dato
7874181 ha le stesse possibilit di restare rispetto a prima se ho deciso di tenerlo perch ho fiducia in lui

7874235 if you dont like plain water try adding citrus or a splash of juice or brew infused teas like mango or peach which have lots of flavor but no calories
7874236 it sounds like a lot but it is well worth it because at the same time you are meeting your fiber goals and feeling more satisfied from the volume of food
7874237 i love to take seasonal vegetables and make stir fries frittatas risotto pilafs soups or layer on sandwiches
7874238 it is so easy to buy a variety of vegetables and incorporate them into dishes
7874239 hunger is your bodys way of telling you that you need fuel so when a craving doesnt come from hunger eating will never satisfy it
7874240 your stomach is only the size of your fist so it takes just a handful of food to fill it comfortably
7874241 sitting down with a bag of chips or cookies in front of the television is an example of eating amnesia where you mindlessly eat without being hungry but out of habit

7874243 you can enjoy your favorite foods but you must do so in moderation
7874244 by making it into an adventure you dont have to worry about the temptation of having treats in the house and it is a fun and pleasurable way to make it work when you are trying to lose weight
7874245 studies show people who eat 4 5 meals or snacks per day are better able to control their appetite and weight
7874246 diets higher in protein and moderate in carbs along with a lifestyle of regular exercise have an excellent potential to help weight loss
7874247 food that is loaded with flavor will stimulate your taste buds and be more satisfying so you wont eat as much
7874248 when you are eating out order a childs pizza or a small sandwich as an easy way to trim calories and get your portions under control
7874249 if you dont love certain fruits or vegetables it could be because you ate them out of season when they have little taste or flavor
7874250 when you eat seasonally fruits and vegetables are more flavorful at their best and i promise you wont be disappointed
7874251 you can save from 100 200 calories if you reduce the portion of starch on your plate and increase the amount of vegetables
7874252 when you do it sets up a negative thought pattern which is why so many people say they hate to exercise

7874299 in het rechterdeel van de grotten zijn inderdaad zwarte vlekken te zien maar dat betreft maar een heel klein deel van alle afbeeldingen ik denk dat in totaal 1 procent van de grot is aangetast voor de rest is de grot in excellente staat

7874314 the capture of the speakers chair by the mdc levelled the ground effectively achieving a power sharing structure in the legislature outside the negotiations

7874316 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high
7874317 at the beginning of 2008 we predicted that wed see an increase in cybercriminals exploiting myspace facebook and similar sites and were now seeing evidence of this im sure that this is simply the first step and that virus writers will continue to target these resources with increased intensity

7874324 study which also came to a similar conclusion as it emphasized the need for authentic communities to foster these relationships

7874344 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7874345 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
7874346 americans are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that connects our hearts that is why i love this country
7874347 i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures

7874366 were not here to establish long term permanent housing its going to be a challenge as we approach three years
7874367 the federal government has been absolutely dragging their feet in every way possible in not building affordable housing
7874368 theyve spent a lot of time energy and money tearing affordable housing down but not enough to build new affordable housing
7874369 well wind up with a new wave of homeless folks
7874370 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7874371 im just going to keep fighting to find a place to live
7874372 fema keeps bailing us out but somehow i always feel like a victim
7874373 you are stuck for so long in a temporary housing situation that you end up running up costs and its not the most efficient way to deliver long term housing needs its bleeding your ability to put your money in longer term needs
7874374 were in this interim phase where were trying to move people out of travel trailers and mobile homes and into rental units that well help pay for
7874375 but the third phase the permanent housing is going to be a challenge
7874376 but so much of it never reached the people who needed it
7874377 you know these industrial jobs help support all of our other jobs
7874378 we dont have enough land in the city so if youre a developer where are you going to go
7874379 we need to jump start the process by being able to clean up a site
7874380 we could then be able to sell or lease that property and use that money to buy more of this property and build on our success
7874381 parking is becoming a real premium in columbia borough as it is in all older municipalities
7874382 we have to find space to allow parking wherever we can and this is going to allow us to do that
7874383 if we want to preserve farmland we have to make our boroughs and urban areas attractive places for businesses and for people to live

7874394 and when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins
7874395 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose

7874400 anderson did well until he got to 60 minutes and started blowing
7874401 no we have a little joke with him about that kind of thing but hes a fantastic footballer with great abilities and weve not seen the best of him yet im sure
7874402 his barnets shocking at the minute his extensions have come out and hes been in china where hes had nobody with the capability to braid him up hopefully now hes back in manchester he can get hold of the person who normally does it for him
7874403 i think its great that players are posing problems for the manager because theyre putting in performances that demand at least a place on the bench if not starting
7874404 this win was vital because by the time we play next in the premier league well be a game or two behind teams and there could have been a big points difference between us if wed not won mentally it would have been a bit of a downer
7874405 but we put in a good performance and got a good result our general play was very good very fluid we passed the ball from the back through to the front with a little bit of ease to be honest our midfielders were really good on the ball and we opened up portsmouth a number of times
7874406 we gave anderson a bit of stick when we saw his hair
7874407 but he was amazing for us a star performer he gets the crowd going and the team hes just all action the sooner we have him flying again the better and im sure hell play a vital part in the games weve got coming up
7874408 em dez anos se a ind stria automotiva n o se comprometer com os princ pios de baixa emiss o ou emiss o zero provavelmente n o existir mais

7874411 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7874412 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7874413 we have successful captured saddam hussein by dropping cluster bombs containing his wanted posters over major iraqi cities were still working on bin ladens portrait
7874414 for us its cluster or nuclear theres no two way about it
7874415 it is going to be a lot of money if dsta is to abandon their development on the finger bomb
7874416 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7874417 its essentially a film for adults even though i hope young people will also enjoy the film
7874418 were glad that all the hard work has paid off
7874419 we actually experimented with the made but some things are just out of our control
7874420 this shows that our education system is moving in the right direction were now exploring the possibility for liberal arts colleges like very college to set up campuses in singapore we have to nurture and retain talents like tiuley and mi nyp
7874421 i cant believe he mm lee called me those horrible things
7874422 after giving it much thought ive decided that im not friending him anymore
7874423 obviously the temperature was heating up in the courtroom but everything still seemed to be under control especially after chee said he harboured no ill will against the lees then out of the blue he says something like this its going to be hard to patch things up again
7874424 mm lee did say some unfriendly things but was there a need to break off the friendship now if he chee wants to friend mm lee again it will be like trying to put toothpaste back into the tube too late already
7874425 weve found out that there are some unique local practices that may aid students ability to remember schoolwork
7874426 these methods are exceptionally popular in singapore taiwan and parts of china especially the burnt notes method
7874427 i used to drink 2 to 3 litres of burnt notes a day
7874428 wahhh what are you trying to do didnt you see ive choped the table
7874429 if you can move people fast feed people fast the economy will grow fast
7874430 confers upon the owner of the packet of facial towel hereby known as the chopper the right to interfere with public property rights including uses that may interfere with public health safety peace or convenience
7874431 upon the chopping any third party shall possess no right or power to dispose of the packet or to occupy the lot without the permission of the chopper or the vendor at the hawker stall directly in front of the property in question
7874432 a monarchy stifles economic progress as power is not evenly distributed
7874433 democracy ensures that power is spread out and not concentrated within a few people and their families
7874434 from what weve seen in the past new hello kitty toys lead to lower worker productivity and generally bring the economy to a standstill as everyone and his mother in law rushes to queue for the irresistible things
7874435 i was executing my ronaldo manoeuvre when my right ankle landed into a hole after that everything was blur i couldnt remember anything else other that the pain
7874436 its really sad to hear about the accident what am i supposed to do without him now
7874437 but even then he will not be as good as he used to be
7874438 he has had early degeneration of joint in his ankle which is why he is pes c9l2 in army in the first place this will be a complicated and expensive procedure
7874439 the boy was so good with his move the fat one has no chance then suddenly he just fell at first i thought he was just acting like drogba but he never got up
7874440 how can they let this happen my poor boy has to suffer so much because the playing field is damaged by the government
7874441 this is a pretty unique case we should be looking at negligence and possibly loss of income the case is somewhat similar to the bah versus mod case from 1981
7874442 the boy is just ungrateful ive gotten him so many tuition teachers for every subject so that he has tuition every day even on saturday and sunday you know
7874443 i bought him the toy in the end because i loved him so much and because he recently topped the class and see what he does to me now
7874444 at my current level of fury i feel capable of giving at least 25 hard whacks before feeling tired but if he says its not his fault or blames other people or does anything that makes me even angrier i may just undergo a limit break and rapidly dish out a frenzied series of whacks that could add up to 37 altogether
7874445 but problems outside the court got too much for me to take
7874446 i made a few friends especially fei fei and lei zhang who made special effort to speak slowly and in mandarin rather than their machine gun xinjiang dialect but they were always talking about things like how taiwan belongs to them and how badass the dalai lama is and i just couldnt fit in
7874447 i missed home too much the food the people the singlish everything
7874448 todas la pasiones son buenas cuando uno es due o de ellas y todas son malas cuando nos esclavizan
7874449 no hay que temer a las sombras solo indican que en un lugar cercano resplandece luz
7874450 there is such a fear of women coming into power that when they protest they are given more weight
7874451 just the fact of women saying they support their candidate and want to make their voices heard sounds more scary than it would be if it were guys thats just part of backlash but come on when women gather around a water fountain men get scared people oughta just chill
7874452 we are in the middle of a revolution women are stepping up and taking power
7874453 we presume the cause of death was heart failure stemming from exhaustion
7874454 our first goal which we have already met was to have every single korean pro game of significance commentated
7874455 i try to make it as accessible as possible without being patronizing at the same time
7874456 one of our challenges from this point on is branding
7874457 whenever people see ncsoft they say oh thats the korean company
7874458 es una regla en la amistad que cuando la desconfianza entra por la puerta el afecto sale por la ventana
7874459 enga o repetido y poner en peligro la vida de sus clientas
7874460 for several years the community of oleary has needed a new ball field and with the canada games coming to p e i in 2009 it presented an excellent opportunity for us to apply for funding
7874461 we could not have undertaken this project without the partnership of the federal and provincial governments in conjunction with the community
7874462 this is a strong violation of the spirit of tae kwon do and the olympic games

7874476 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
7874477 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7874478 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7874479 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7874480 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7874481 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

7874549 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
7874550 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
7874551 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that are essential in order to improve drug therapies
7874552 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part

7874580 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7874582 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7874583 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7874593 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels
7874594 young people and their parents continually ask for sex and relationships to be taught in schools
7874595 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum

7874645 we do recognize the budgetary concern however its important we continue to do all we can to present the city accurately and in its best light
7874646 thats an example of a business that the city may not have been able to attract 10 years ago

7874681 we are estimating the market for us to be about 500 million to 1 billion globally this product was developed specifically to capture the actual real time readings of the small systems which up until now have been too expensive to monitor by conventional means with our product we are talking about pennies per day

7874691 weve opened up the offense and freed up the younger guys outside it just gives us more of an option from game to game
7874692 the mentality is we are going to go in and run the football from the get go
7874693 we might get one or two yards the whole first quarter and then the second quarter four and five yards then we start wearing on guys and then we are getting five 10 or 15 yards a run so it might not be exciting or the greatest show on turf but it is going to be efficient football and it is going to be fun and it will be team football its the way we can keep possession of the ball and keep our defense off the field and try to be the aggressor
7874694 if the run is popping it usually means we are not doing a good enough job with pad level and hand placement and footwork
7874695 its a subtle thing its details and fundamentals its not a lack of talent its fundamentals
7874696 when it works our pads are down and when it doesnt we get high and we get jolted its that simple when i block that number i got a chance if you stuff me we dont have a chance we have to win the battles up front

7874707 this paper proposes a generalized rank test that can be used both for testing cumulative abnormal returns as well as single abnormal returns empirical properties of the test statistics are studied with simulations using crsp returns the results show that the popular test statistics like patell bmp corrado as well as the adjusted corrado zivney test tend to under reject the null hypothesis as the car period increases the suggested generalized rank test seems to avoid this bias furthermore it is robust against the event imposed volatility and cross correlation due to the event day clustering and foremost it is more powerful than the standard parametric tests of patell and bmp

7874712 added the father who had announced in the newspaper of its intention to organize this competition from september for nuns on his blog
7874713 nunca houve tanta certeza de que temos mais incertezas pela frente
7874714 n s queremos dar mais import ncia para o conceito nominal ent o n s vamos olhar daqui para frente mais para o nominal do que para o prim rio n o vai eliminar evidentemente nem o prim rio nem o operacional s o conceitos que ficam
7874715 nosso objetivo buscar focar mais no super vit nominal dar mais import ncia ao super vit nominal e em 2010 o meu objetivo eliminar o d ficit nominal e passar para super vit nominal
7874716 ich habe eine menge interviews und b hnenshows hinter mir wobei die h lfte der fragen ungef hr erscheint mgs4 f r die xbox 360 oder andere formate lautet
7874717 ich hoffe die leute wollen in naher zukunft von mir etwas ber metal gear ber uns oder unsere zuk nftigen projekte wissen anstatt sich um die hardware zu k mmern
7874718 vermutlich nicht m glich weil mgs4 f r die ps3 optimiert wurde
7874719 wisst ihr was mich manchmal ein wenig beunruhigt ist die tatsache dass es den leuten nicht um die hardware geht wenn sie mir diese fragen hinsichtlich der ps3 und xbox 360 stellen ich m chte dass sie sich das spiel selbst anschauen manchmal glaube ich sogar es sollte auf dem pc erscheinen damit sie mich nicht ber hardware und plattformen befragen
7874720 wenn wir ber die zukunft sprechen nicht mgs4 sondern meine kommenden titel und die hardware technologie sich verbessert dann wird es nicht mehr von der hardware abh ngen vermutlich werde ich erst die software erschaffen und dann es ist schwer zu sagen es auf andere hardware portieren sofern diese technologischen m glichkeiten sich in allen bereichen verbessern
7874721 were worried that a rape victim wont be told she can get emergency contraception because the attending nurse has a moral objection to that
7874722 we want individual conscience rights to be honored but were also concerned about the employers
7874723 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7874724 and i said to myself something is going on here
7874725 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7874726 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7874727 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7874728 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7874729 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7874730 aun sin ver veo que el mundo es de colores aun sin ver disfruto la vida por que me imagino un mundo mejor talvez
7874731 sabes yo comenc a vivir realmente despu s de que qued paral tico por primera vez en la vida tuve tiempo de mirarme a mi mismo ver mi vida mis reacciones y pensamientos mi vida se hizo mucho m s profunda m s rica y mucho m s atractiva que antes
7874732 no question commissioned work provides the most revenue and is the most profitable
7874733 with the relatively recent plunge in stock pricing its a toss up between that and my new card series for the number two spot prints are a distant last place and only make up about 5 percent of my revenue
7874734 asistiremos a debatir pero no aceptaremos las condiciones del alcalde
7874735 this applies to an enterprise trying to cut costs a young business unexpectedly saturated with customer demand or a start up looking to launch
7874736 a head in the cloud the power of infrastructure as a service
7874737 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
7874738 the selection of activevos for this important application demonstrates its suitability for the complex integrations and applications required in governmental systems
7874739 developing the ngi system using rigorously standards based business process management bpm and workflow capabilities meets the needs of it in government by offering a unique combination of openness and ease of use with activevos governmental applications can be easily developed and extended in ways never before possible
7874740 its a reflection of peoples desperation more than it is a reflection of just positive things about people working longer and being happy to work longer
7874741 thats just going to be exacerbated by the current economy
7874742 im getting a lot of phone calls by people who are trying to come up with alternatives theyre really starting to worry
7874743 the rough part in what were seeing with a couple of these folks is that they had planned on doing some consulting if they needed the extra income
7874744 now theyre panicked and wanting the extra income and they cant get the consulting because everybodys cutting back and the consulting jobs are drying up
7874745 certainly episodic changes in the economy change short term behaviors
7874746 the good news bad news story is that we are living longer so you actually need to have more money
7874747 certainly there are pension reasons for people wanting to stay in
7874748 defined benefits and social security tend to let people retire when the economy is worse 401 k s and housing to the extent that those values shrink when the economy is doing badly have the opposite effect
7874749 its a negative macro economic trend and it definitely has been worrisome
7874750 before there was social security people worked until they died or they lived with their kids
7874751 there really has never been a generation where people have been expected to fund years of retirement out of savings its kind of heroic what were asking people to do now
7874752 overall there may be a silver lining in all of this
7874753 that information transfer and big shock of losing so many workers in such a short amount of time may be lessened if these 65 to 70 year olds stay in the labor force a little bit longer
7874754 they want to continue to contribute and they want to be doing something worthwhile
7874755 they are afraid to start doing nothing for fear that theyll fall apart and the more they stay physically and mentally active the longer theyre going to have a fulfilling life
7874756 for many people it just makes sense to keep on working
7874757 i would not be surprised at all if we see that average age of retirement creeping up and not necessarily because of any financial pressure although that may be part of it but i dont see that as the main motivating thing
7874758 i dont know what i would do if i retired
7874759 basically i want to work i want to do something
7874760 it got harder to leave when you got to be here awhile it was just easier to stay
7874761 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7874762 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7874763 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7874764 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7874840 together we have been able to expand dental care so that we dont have another sad tragedy like that of deamonte driver the 12 year old boy who passed away last year after an infection caused by an untreated toothache
7874841 a strong public dental health safety net is critical to meet our states oral health needs and these grants ensure our most vulnerable citizens get the dental care they deserve
7874842 these four counties were selected because they documented that significant oral health challenges exist among their residents
7874843 a dental home will be created in these jurisdictions to provide comprehensive dental health care to their communities
7874844 despite recent statewide improvements in dental health significant dental problems still exist in maryland especially for people with lower incomes and lower educational levels
7874845 we are hopeful that these grants will help us begin to turn the corner in addressing the dental disease problems of our neediest state residents

7874856 but these national cases and outbreaks show that measles can and still does occur in the u s when parents choose not to vaccinate their children they put others at risk including children under 12 months who have not yet been vaccinated children and adults with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients and most importantly even some children who have been fully vaccinated against measles
7874857 that means one in a hundred or about 5 000 mississippi children who have been vaccinated against measles are still susceptible an unvaccinated child poses a risk to others even those vaccinated

7875014 and i feel happy to have participated in such a huge competition
7875015 the most memorable time for me was being with my team mates and running for my country i felt so proud to represent costa rica at such a big event
7875016 i am young and if i train hard i can make it for the next olympics
7875017 i just need to keep training i just want to run and be fast
7875018 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for
7875019 it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7875020 im satisfied with the result but also a bit annoyed with myself i definitely lacked experience compared to the others many of whom had been to at least two olympics before
7875021 the difference is they know how to handle the situation of being under pressure and shooting for medals
7875022 i didnt concentrate well pressure was very very high and luck was not by my side
7875023 but the whole issue being a part of the olympics was great being among the best 10 500 athletes in the world was an amazing experience
7875024 the organisation was excellent the accommodation food training possibilities the competition space the entertainment for the athletes everything worked like clockwork
7875025 the draw went very well for me on paper i should have been able to beat my opponents
7875026 i learnt a great deal during the games from other competitors techniques which i have already begun to build into my routine
7875027 i have felt very comfortable here and the chinese people have been very helpful and friendly
7875028 this is the first time for me to compete in such a big event and i feel very fortunate
7875029 my situation in cambodia is not good as you know i dont know if things will improve but i will lobby those in charge to make conditions better for sportsmen and women

7875031 i said to her im very sorry then she blew up
7875032 it is her who has turned the whole funeral into politics

7875043 i come here as a wife who loves my husband
7875044 and you see that is why i love this country
7875045 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7875046 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7875047 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and
7875048 and you see that is why i love this country
7875049 now you know why i asked her out so many times you want a persistent president
7875050 a whole night of the dnc was a wasted opportunity
7875051 a beacon something to aspire to be as a democrat
7875052 he looked healthy he looked strong he really energized the crowd
7875053 he really just was a beacon something to aspire to as a democrat
7875054 it seems like a whole night of the dnc was a wasted opportunity to unite democrats and whip up a celebratory atmosphere
7875055 while it was thoughtful genuine and sensitive it appeared apologetic to me in the end
7875056 her father worked every day to provide for his family just like my mom who goes to work every day even when she is in pain
7875057 i was surprised that she was a very good speaker
7875058 she spoke very eloquently made good points and a good case for her husband
7875059 it is speeches like the one michelle obama gave tonight that keep me convinced that the democratic party truly does care for every man woman and child in this country and on this planet

7875074 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7875075 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7875091 even though prices have come down who knows what is going to happen in two years
7875092 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels
7875093 young people and their parents continually ask for sex and relationships to be taught in schools
7875094 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7875095 we have held a review into the delivery and content of sex and relationships education and will report back in due course

7875101 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7875102 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7875103 i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7875104 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7875105 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7875106 today we have structure government parliament legal authorities and our national institutions have reached strength our police and army are growing
7875107 the requirement of time as well as painful incidents of civilian casualties compelled the afghan government to demand talks on regulating the presence of international forces in afghanistan
7875108 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in dprk as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7875109 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7875110 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying

7875120 has made clear who she intends to vote for and that would be senator mccain
7875121 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7875122 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7875123 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7875124 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke

7875131 it has been almost five years since the tragedy on the staten island ferry occurred and the pain my children and i have endured words cannot express
7875132 throughout these years the city tried every legal maneuver to wear us down and to stop us from being fairly compensated but i strongly felt they needed to be held highly accountable for this tragedy one that should have and could have been prevented it was my decision to take a stance that i would take this to trial if i felt a reasonable settlement offer was not presented it wasnt until a judge ordered an independent mediator to resolve this and almost five years after the tragedy and one week before the trial the city of new york finally got it
7875133 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7875134 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7875135 were going do some tracks and im really looking forward to it because i like them a lot

7875142 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7875143 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7875144 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7875145 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7875146 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more

7875176 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7875177 forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives
7875178 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and family and to earn a living wage

7875192 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
7875193 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
7875194 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
7875195 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice

7875293 barang yang dalam jumlah besarnya dapat memabukkan maka statusnya tetap haram meski dalam jumlah sedikit
7875294 barangsiapa makan bawang merah atau bawang putih maka hendaklah menjauhi kami masjid kami dan hendaklah ia berdiam saja di rumahnya

7875296 jika hukumnya makruh lalu mengapa kalian hisap bukankah makruh itu lebih dekat kepada haram daripada ke halal
7875297 sungguh hal yang halal itu jelas dan haram pun juga sudah jelas namun di antara keduanya terdapat perkara perkara yang tidak jelas kebanyakan orang tidak mengetahui perkara perkara tersebut barangsiapa berhati hati terhadap hal yang tidak jelas statusnya maka sungguh ia telah menjaga agama dan kehormatannya barangsiapa yang terjerumus dalam perkara yang tidak jelas sungguh ia telah terjerumus dalam perkara yang haram seperti seorang penggembala yang menggembalakan ternaknya di dekat daerah larangan ia akan segera menggembala di daerah larangan tersebut

7875324 i can do a lot more for our state by leading change in congress than by throwing around taxpayer money
7875325 the reforms i fight for in washington have specific benefits for people across south carolina folks in our state are being forced to pay for wasteful spending high gas prices and rising health care costs these are things i hear about all the time at home and they are the issues i work on the most
7875326 its almost a south carolina tradition in many ways to influence national policy with respect to the interests of south carolinians
7875327 it is shameful when 70 senators oppose investigating how much taxpayers money will go to a company countrywide that tried to give favors to politicians
7875328 this vote is going to make people wonder how many others in congress have something to hide
7875329 the folks i talk to around the state are fed up with all the wasteful spending and misguided policies coming out of washington and they like having someone up there to stand up to it
7875330 their rhetoric was trained on a different time and a different set of problems i think their rhetoric needs to be updated
7875331 i spend most of my time in washington working on ideas to reform health care reduce taxes and fix social security
7875332 but when necessary im not going to be shy about fighting legislation that would bankrupt our economy or take away our freedoms
7875333 i probably spend more time on local and state issues than i do on national issues

7875340 today we take another step forward in a new vision for this neighborhood
7875341 mayor mccrory and the city of charlotte will not only cultivate a community of new homes retail and green spaces for its citizens but will generate hundreds of news jobs in the process
7875342 this latest hud partnership allows charlotteto implement our ambitious plans to invest in the double oaks neighborhood and to continue the revitalization of the statesville avenue corridor
7875343 these numbers reflect an increasingly vibrant entrepreneurial culture at ohsu in which partnerships such as one weve forged with intel to help people maintain their independence as they age are flourishing
7875344 gains of this magnitude would not have been possible without the oregon opportunity which combined state funds and private donations to pay for research facilities and infrastructure at ohsu that are among the most advanced in the country and for the recruitment of world class scientists who are blazing new trails in biomedical research
7875345 an emerging model for creating effective university industry collaborations because it enables both the company and ohsu to achieve their respective objectives it is a prime example of the pragmatic approach we have taken in negotiating with industry and it is that approach which has helped enable us to achieve the gains we have

7875353 kalau tidak jelas begini bagaimana ini akan saya bawa ke pusat sekarang tidak ada yang berwenang untuk menjawab persoalan ini kita khawatir nanti masyarakat semakin resah apalagi di bulan september memasuki bulan ramadhan saya tidak bisa membayangkan bagaimana kondisi seperti ini

7875366 were probably getting to a point where at least the median price is starting to spur on some buying interest and thats the first step prices getting down to a level
7875367 when we remove that inventory were going to start to see some real improvement but we dont expect that to happen until the first quarter of 09
7875368 prices are still falling but at a progressively lesser pace this is the slowest decline since last july it seems that some areas are now finding a base it is reasonably encouraging in that it suggests that some parts of the problem are more localized now
7875369 i thought it was a reasonably good report on the housing market we had a much smaller rate of decline than we had in prior months we also had several cities that showed noticeable increases in price the price declines were concentrated in the cities that were unusually robust during 2005 and 2006 and you should expect price adjustments in those markets
7875370 its more of the same we are looking for the case shiller measure to eventually show a 40 percent total decline peak to trough the key point is we are a long way from bottoming out the bulls keep hoping otherwise but the basic problem is excess inventories they are the mortal enemy of prices thats true of any goods producing sector and certainty is true of housing we estimate that 2 million houses were built during the boom and weve only worked that excess down to 1 8 million as of the beginning of 2008 we think we will see prices falling until the fourth quarter of 2010 there will be a lot more write downs at financial institutions and a lot more problems for consumers they have run out of borrowing power principally because they can no longer rely on home equity
7875371 i think we have to accept that exclusivity is not a thing of the past but it is probably with publishers
7875372 we might do a few things where we feel that we need a push here or a push there
7875373 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform

7875982 andreas is just scratching the surface of what hes capable of
7875983 he has really developed into a much better all around player and i think hes going to be a dangerous offensive weapon in the pros
7875984 andreas has the ability to do a lot of things at high speed
7875985 hes an excellent skater hes got very good hands he can go out and make plays shoot the puck in stride hes physically already filled out
7875986 we talked to him about turning pro last year at this time but he wanted to go back and improve on a lot of things in his game and we watched him a lot over the course of the season and i think he did that when we approached him at the end of the year about where he was at he wanted to turn pro we were happy to have him
7875987 they really emphasize being in good condition i worked out a lot i ran a lot which i hadnt done in the past a lot of running a lot of biking all that stuff to get in the best shape possible
7875988 i played playoff hockey for 10 games and it was just unbelievable it was so helpful next year ill be ready to go
7875989 decided to compromise by giving hyatt a chance to fulfill their commitments by managing this serving of alcohol in a secluded restaurant on the 40th floor so he would keep his hotel with the family atmosphere he would like to present to his guests
7875990 wouldnt give you the impact on the alcohol ban that much as if you were in the winter season which features businesspeople and international tourists
7875991 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible

7875995 for besieging the afghan and foreign forces in kabul we have begun the initial work on the main roads leading to kabul from four directions
7875996 she got more votes than he obama did ive seen conventions where candidates with three or four thousand votes got nominated what is the problem
7875997 people are released with the idea that if they still feel the need to vote for her whether its emotionally philosophically that there would be no recrimination for doing so
7875998 maybe some questions like how do i make sure im showing support for barack obama at the same time acknowledging that sen clintons journey was historic as well you dont get to have two different votes
7875999 you cant help but feel like something important was taken away
7876000 people need to recognize the historic nature of what was accomplished it would be good to recognize that at this convention
7876001 we know that when we walk out of here after thursday night we are all going to be working to elect obama president it will be a totally unified group
7876002 and so my plea to you is lets get this family together and win this election this fall
7876003 to ignore the advice of lawmakers and refrain from recognizing georgias breakaway regions as independent
7876004 would visit georgia a blast of support for an ally still reeling from its brief war with russia
7876005 neither medvedev nor prime minister vladimir putin indicated whether the government would follow through and formally recognize the secession of south ossetia and abkhazia over the objections of the united states and georgias other western allies but in separate remarks the two russian leaders declared the government was ready to suffer a breakdown in relations with nato and setbacks in its efforts to join the world trade organization
7876006 say it is unlikely that the kremlin will take action immediately on the parliamentary resolutions but that the votes were a way to increase pressure on georgias government and increase russias negotiating clout with nato as the conflict in georgia moves from a military one to a political one
7876007 win support among iraqi leaders for a draft security accord with the united states
7876008 extract further concessions from american officials less than a week after both sides said they had agreed to remove all us combat troops by the end of 2011
7876009 disputed malikis statement and made clear the two countries are still at odds over the terms of a us withdrawal
7876010 maliki dug in his heels monday on the future of the us military in iraq insisting that all foreign soldiers leave the country by a specific date in 2011 and rejecting legal immunity for american troops
7876011 though mr maliki seemed to be referring to all foreign troops in his statements iraqi negotiators have said recently that an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only and that training and support forces could remain after that if invited by the iraqi government
7876012 has bowed to iraqi pressure for a troop withdrawal timetable
7876013 to a plan that looks embarrassingly closer to the position of barack obama
7876014 the british role all along has been one of training and assistance to the fledgling iraqi security forces
7876015 gains seen on the ground make talk of a complete british withdrawal from the south of iraq in early 2009 seem like a realistic possibility

7876026 an adult in a silver subaru forester ca lic 5ppm447 it was sometime during the awards on sunday guy was seen yelled at and chased on foot but he was already in his car driving away thanks
7876027 hes a gutless wonder he doesnt have the courage to face us
7876028 he doesnt care for the country people he only cares for melbourne
7876029 if we work together to deliver what is in effect a food bowl renaissance a transformation of northern victoria we will secure this regions future productivity and sustainability
7876030 its all right to have a plan to modernise the food bowl but where is the water to be pumped to melbourne if we havent got enough water here to operate the system
7876031 few australians realise the extent and quality of their own wilderness
7876032 we just take whats here for granted not realising how rare it is
7876033 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant
7876034 if the land is left empty it will degrade over time thats why one of our focuses is to encourage the employment of indigenous rangers
7876035 we believe these should be full time jobs with the rangers having increased resources like four wheel drive vehicles and where necessary helicopters 700 is just not enough for these vast areas
7876036 by marrying overseas resources with local expertise we aim to make a big difference in looking after our outback
7876037 this means that theres no way the toads could invade southern parts like melbourne adelaide because they wouldnt be able to move
7876038 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7876039 we have never lost our belief that we are called to a better country and a newer world i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate when we form the next congress

7876050 whats to stop someone installing it in their bathroom and recording secret footage of their guests
7876051 cut into muscle and bone and slash indiscriminately because of the various cycles in the economy
7876052 this is not just a reaction to todays market conditions its a reaction to the realisation that we have to be a lean and more agile and fundamentally different company if were going to succeed in the modern media world
7876053 the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7876054 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7876055 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7876056 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7876057 to be honest i dont want to stump up 10 000 for a bloke ive never met and theres no way i want to be seen at something like that
7876058 i dont want to say too much but there will be a few union blokes heading along he said
7876059 but it really has nothing to do with the union its more them supporting mick
7876060 all the people that are coming are coming because theyre friends of mine and they support an innocent man
7876061 i told bradman what bill had said about him on tape that he didnt ever criticise bradman because he didnt want to piss on a national monument
7876062 i asked bradman what he thought about that he thought for a split second and replied i agree with the principle that you should not desecrate national monuments and if there were a monument to bill and even if it were on fire i wouldnt desecrate it
7876063 ill handle it go get ready for school or youre going to be late
7876064 it is as if the machinery inherited in the howard governments policies is driving the rudd governments agenda
7876065 if action is not taken soon the long term decline in the commonwealths funding to public schools will continue to its inevitable progress towards the commonwealth abrogating its responsibility for public schools
7876066 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7876067 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7876068 mr clinton feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7876069 cutting jobs from regional markets would just damage essentially good businesses
7876070 this is about productivity and efficiency mostly at the metropolitan end
7876071 from an investment perspective its positive because theyre aligning the costs with the revenues which is what you want to see
7876072 for anyone involved in fairfax its tough but you just have to look overseas to whats happening there and 5 of the workforce is a lot less than what some of the big us newspapers are announcing
7876073 it is an important commentary on how we do business
7876074 we talk directly to our employees in the end they are the people affected here its their livelihood
7876075 when you get kids in institutions then youre just compounding the problem
7876076 what were doing is consigning those kids to places where were saying were giving up on you that weve got nothing else that all we can do is contain you until youre 18 and then youll end up in the adult system
7876077 a defining moment in terms of the trade union movement and the labor party
7876078 prevent the worst possible future uses of the abccs powers
7876079 the benefits of having a permanent school nurse are extraordinary but we are still seeing numbers drop away
7876080 on the national level the government is talking about reforming the health system and tackling childhood obesity but nobody has thought of something as simple as a nurse in every primary and secondary school
7876081 shes just fabulous shes made such a big difference already
7876082 we had too many different people involved in looking after the childrens health roster teachers and office staff with other responsibilities ms fisers is a professional she can give a better diagnosis for cough colds and flu she has that extra knowledge and time
7876083 the health problems that children are having these days are so much more serious
7876084 its not just betadine on knees its early onset diabetes asthma and anaphylaxis on the rise i think nurses should be in all primary schools
7876085 the aim of the taliban is to get into the cities and fight us like they are fighting us in iraq
7876086 why do we have a defence force i thought it was to use it not to preserve it
7876087 i believe we can afford to put more troops in i believe we can afford to sustain them
7876088 if you are facing uncertain global economic times ahead the worst thing you can do is send a message of uncertainty to the international economic and financial community about whether this governments budget is going to pass the parliament and whether its surplus is going to remain intact
7876089 seeking to undermine the governments efforts to assist the reserve bank in the struggle to keep interest rates as low as possible
7876090 i do not really know any more who takes the decisions over on their side of the house
7876091 were not going to block the budget its not a 1975 situation with the whitlam government
7876092 the results demonstrated that not only can we meet expectations but we can beat expectations
7876093 so as we look ahead there is probably more freedom for prices to stay flat or go up than there is for prices to go down
7876094 the driver of our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7876095 while equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7876096 in failing to refit the switches the company preferred profit over the safety of its employees
7876097 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7876098 the airline industry looks set to go through a period of significant readjustment
7876099 we would be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15
7876100 ive been around long enough to know that you dont look at seven weeks and say its all over and things are back to normal
7876101 we expect prices for rio tintos major commodities to remain substantially above the long run trend in 2009

7876105 hybrids is one of the best books i have read and you are my favourite author
7876106 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7876107 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7876108 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7876109 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7876110 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7876111 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7876112 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7876113 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7876114 hij probeert zo ongeveer op de stoel van jetnetherlands te gaan zitten heeft overal een mening over maar beschikt alleen niet over de specialistische kennis urenlange besprekingen zijn daarvan het gevolg over de operationele kant van zaken het aantal kopjes aan boord het merk servies en de lengte van de rok van de stewardess maar niet over klachten over de diensten van jetnetherlands
7876115 speculanten die woningen leeg laten staan krijgen met het wetsvoorstel vrij spel

7876117 bakit po ba ang school dito sa bolosan elementary school eh humihingi sila ng pampagawa gaya ng semento sa mga bata at pati project nila eh pera at dapat hindi bababa sa 50 pesos at kailangan daw yon para may grade sila nagtatanong lang po

7876120 do you want to have your mother or father sleeping in the hallway
7876121 its a teaching hospital where residents go to learn to do things the right way this is the example theyre setting
7876122 there are nursing shortages everywhere but its particularly difficult to recruit psychiatric nurses
7876123 theres a lot of concern about the psychiatric work force aging and not as many younger people going into the disciplines that would work in an environment like that
7876124 we understand that this release raises significant issues and we are taking serous steps to address them
7876125 the soil sampling should have been conducted immediately after the spill
7876126 information is not available in the report on the length of time between the spill and collection of soil and groundwater samples
7876127 he was conducting that type of business in that type of environment that could have been extremely dangerous to both him and his patients
7876128 my intention wasnt to make money my intention was to help people
7876129 i tried to get a license here and it cost too much money
7876130 but i think he felt he was going to do it anyway
7876131 if god for a second forgot what i have become and granted me a little bit more of life i would use it to the best of my ability
7876132 im not ready to judge yet there are a lot of politics that come into play on a small island like that
7876133 i hope the allegations arent true hes very respected in his industry and his record of accomplishment speaks for itself
7876134 hes just a completely driven extremely talented person and thats why this is so baffling
7876135 we did our homework on him and everywhere hes ever worked had this same glowing report about what he had done
7876136 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portion and patients benefits actually decrease
7876137 here i am a person whos worked his entire life paid his bills does the right thing has insurance and i cant get a procedure that i need done
7876138 we feel that this is more of an issue with an insurance company
7876139 employers are either cutting back on the benefits that they offer employees or asking employees to contribute a bigger stake in their health care
7876140 somebody facing a catastrophic illness and having to be burdened with the extra stress of paying a co pay or premium is just unconscionable
7876141 we believe the judge recognized shermans extremely minimal role in bronders scheme
7876142 with few surprises in the result investor attention will turn to the strategic wine review and the search for a new ceo
7876143 we are confident that both will be concluded by calendar year end and remain positive catalysts for the stock
7876144 with basically the equity and the debt markets in quite a large amount of turmoil right at this time weve decided to defer that and i think its prudent to do that
7876145 the lack of capital management and limited detail around offshore expansion may raise concerns about the risk potential within woolworths
7876146 these businesses have to be high volume low margin businesses so very much in our model
7876147 i believe in our businesses particularly in food that weve grown our market share again and widened the gap on our competitor in fact the numbers that i see absolutely tell me that
7876148 in the 2 years ive been here weve hired very heavily and clearly at some point in time you need to slow that down
7876149 it doesnt involve reducing people but it does certainly involve slowing our expense growth over whats its been historically
7876150 for us its still a bit slower than this time last year
7876151 its not disastrously slower but its probably pretty similar to the second half of last year
7876152 brisbanetimes and watoday are not only big in terms of the size and complexity of them but theyre big because theyre kind of fairfax media statements about moving into a new market so the visibility of those are actually quite high
7876153 well be doing some new things around video and probably some new things around mobile but in terms of big projects we still have plenty of work to do on those four
7876154 while some retailers in other sectors have reportedly encountered a shift in consumer sentiment demand for international travel remains buoyant
7876155 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 to 40 increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 15
7876156 you could consider that to be sensible guidance which requires relatively modest growth from the core business before synergies
7876157 it was something that climate change adviser ross garnaut had in his paper proposing that there be matching tax treatment but is absent in the governments green paper
7876158 there is going to be a tax advantage to buying permits rather than spending money on capital expenditure which may be lucrative enough to discourage companies investing in carbon abatement activities
7876159 preferably the tax deductions for buying equipment should match up to what you would have had on expenditure for permits
7876160 if that were to be deductible in one year for permits then maybe that is what expenditure on equipment should also be
7876161 a global network including operations in europe north america and the middle east as well as asia pacific
7876162 as the clear leader in that potential multibillion dollar market redflex is well positioned and equipped to capitalise on the continued expansion of the market
7876163 this really amounts to pornography when you have young women agreeing to model bathing suits or lingerie for strangers
7876164 im not comfortable with it and i think its an ethical problem
7876165 the web site is what you make it to be
7876166 if you go into this just wanting to make some new friends and earn money toward your surgery then thats what youll find if you go into it thinking its a porn site then thats what it will be
7876167 women are making an educated decision to sign up and use this service
7876168 i think it tends to diminish the seriousness of the operation
7876169 there are a lot of women who may want breast implants but theyre not good candidates for it
7876170 there are so many pressures making women think they are not good enough like they are and they have to do something surgical to please men
7876171 but this is not a medical necessity or something important on the list of things that we should be raising money for
7876172 i thought about the surgery for two years before i finally decided it was something i wanted to do for myself and only for myself
7876173 i just want to feel better when i look in the mirror
7876174 our focus is to ensure we attract the right mix of businesses to the precinct to create a balance of small and large companies technology producers and users to support the development of the marketplace
7876175 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears this distortion into a partial and highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous
7876176 resulted in excess sensitivity of the fed not just to asset prices
7876177 but also the concern and fears of wall street generally the fed and the us taxpayer have effectively underwritten all of the household name us banking system and probably also indirectly most of the other large highly leveraged institutions
7876178 we are just at an early stage of privatisation and we are weak at investment banking by international standards
7876179 he is involved less and less with day to day executive affairs and his credibility is shot
7876180 call my office and tell them ill be in at 10 then book me a massage for 9 mkay
7876181 this indicates that more young people are being detained and that they are in detention for longer
7876182 on an average day over a third of those in community based supervision and nearly half of those in detention were aboriginal and torres strait islander young people
7876183 as someone who diligently avoids plastic bags but takes the plane regularly believe me i know what paying lip service to the environment is all about oh the agony of sorting every scrap of waste in the house into innumerable coloured bins before allowing yourself to hop into the mercedes to check out the sales in the local shop
7876184 there is firm indication of a landslide victory for anwar the voters have given a sound endorsement to anwar
7876185 despite the low turnout anwar is expected to get at least 70 of the vote
7876186 foods with ingredients that i need a dictionary to define i find that the less animal products i consume the better my general health the less refined sugars the less i feel the energy fall out and the more organic fresh produce i eat the lighter i feel
7876187 even poor people don t like to go to a poor person s hospital
7876188 many of these new landlords did not intend to turn to the buy to let market
7876189 with this in mind we are concerned that they have not had the same time as traditional landlords to fully research their legal obligations
7876190 ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law and so we are keen to get the message on tenancy deposit legislation to them to make sure they do not leave themselves open to punitive action
7876191 the high response could be as much about staff awareness of the need to reduce wastage as actual poor performance
7876192 the results do suggest that the public sector like most organisations could do more to stop energy wastage and improve energy efficiency the awareness is there and now organisations need the tools and technology to capitalise on this and take action
7876193 with a number of important targets to meet in terms of efficiency measures and co2 reductions and with the introduction of the carbon reduction commitment for many departments its particularly important for the public sector to commit to a programme of on going efficiency improvements
7876194 many public sector organisations could cut energy wastage and improve efficiency by committing to an on going programme to monitor and reduce energy consumption
7876195 essentially its an energy management journey that starts with better measurement of energy consumption that enables the identification and implementation of appropriate measures to reduce energy consumption
7876196 100 million people around the world are now using facebook this is a really gratifying moment for us because it means a lot that you have decided that facebook is a good trusted place for you to share your lives with your friends so we just wanted to take this moment to say thanks

7876208 nothing serious nothing structural we feel great about that but it will be most likely a week to 10 days before he can play again

7876427 although i had been a christian for more than two decades i had no concept of who jesus was as a person and no idea how i could change that
7876428 instead of trying to build a house church learn to love one another and share one anothers journey who is he asking you to walk alongside right now and how can you encourage them i love it when brothers and sisters choose to be intentional in sharing gods life together in a particular season so yes experiment with community together youll learn a lot just avoid the desire to make it contrived exclusive or permanent relationships dont work that way
7876429 fellowship happens where people share the journey of knowing jesus together it consists of open honest sharing genuine concern about one anothers spiritual well being and encouragement for people to follow jesus however he leads them
7876430 this is what the church is like doesnt my version look better
7876431 i can tell you absolutely that my worst days outside organized religion are still better than my best days inside it
7876432 most of what we call church today are nothing more than well planned performances with little actual connection between believers believers are encouraged toward a growing dependency on the system or its leadership rather than on jesus himself we spend more energy conforming behavior to what the institution needs rather than helping people be transformed at the foot of the cross
7876433 jesus indicated that whenever two or three people get together focused on him they would experience the vitality of church life
7876434 my favorite expression of body life is where a local group of people chooses to walk together for a bit of the journey by cultivating close friendships and learning how to listen to god together
7876435 by providing services to keep people coming an institution unwittingly becomes a distraction to real spiritual life it offers an illusion of spirituality in highly orchestrated experiences but it cannot show people how to live each day in him through the real struggles of life
7876436 the more organization you bring to church life the less life it will contain
7876437 as long as we see church life as a meeting well miss its reality and its depth if the truth were told the scriptures tell us very little about how the early church met it tells us volumes about how they shared life together they didnt see the church as a meeting or an institution but as a family living under father
7876438 any human system will eventually dehumanize the very people it seeks to serve and those it dehumanizes the most are those who think they lead it
7876439 gods wrath at the cross wasnt an expression of the punishment sin deserves it was the antidote for sin and shame

7876442 boeings real point here is that the government has changed its requirements for a tanker so the company needs more time to modify its proposal
7876443 by putting it the way they have they have set it up for a formal protest after all why would the company want to spend millions of dollars on ads and lawyers and question their customers decision if they just intended to drop out

7876445 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7876446 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7876447 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7876448 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals

7876453 one of michelle obamas signature efforts has been working to relieve crowding in the emergency room the second busiest in chicago
7876454 backed by a federal grant michelle obama in 2005 launched the south side health collaborative under which counselors advise patients with noncritical needs that they can receive care elsewhere at a reduced cost
7876455 a hospital report quotes michelle obama as saying the world is seeping in and our salvation will be the success of our partners
7876456 obamas program has enjoyed favorable news media coverage in chicago and was eventually expanded into a broader program the urban health initiative critics however describe the program as an attempt to ensure that the hospital retains only affluent patients with insurance
7876457 if you put enough money into it you could save a whole bunch of community health centers
7876458 edward novak president of chicagos sacred heart hospital declined to discuss the centers initiative in particular but dismissed as bull attempts to justify such programs as good for patients what theyre really saying is dont use our emergency room because it will cost us money and we dont want the public aid population novak said
7876459 we really didnt know what this office would be so it was really her creation
7876460 in december 2006 the medical center hired a public relations firm ask public strategies to help sell the urban health initiative
7876461 the firm delivered its report in may 2007 saying that while nurses were generally favorable about the urban health initiative primary care doctors were more negative viewing it as a break with ucmcs community commitment
7876462 while most of those surveyed expressed favorable views of the center and its program critics complained of arrogance and a lack of empathy
7876463 one survey question asked for reaction to a particular criticism that had been leveled
7876464 this new health initiative is not really about helping the residents of the south side of chicago
7876465 ive had some complaints from my constituents said alderman toni preckwinkle a former teacher who represents chicagos 4th ward and who will be an obama delegate at the democratic national convention
7876466 asked her personal conclusion preckwinkle paused they have decided they need to have as many paying patients as possible
7876467 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7876468 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say you are going to do
7876469 mr obamas campaign began sending out a one page sheet of daily talking points to delegates instructing them what to say and what to avoid in talking to reporters

7876514 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7876515 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7876516 sarada was depressed because she had a lot of pressure from her husband to send money her husband was very sick the money she was sending was all spent on medical costs she was very upset about this because she wanted the money for her children to go to school
7876517 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7876518 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
7876519 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement

7876547 het is een homofobe reactie van de katholieke kerk die probeert te verstoppen dat er homoseksuele priesters bestaan
7876548 de beslissing van het vaticaan om een lichaam uit zijn rustplaats te halen is gravenschennis en religieuze ontheiliging het schendt de uitdrukkelijke wens van de kardinaal om voor eeuwig naast zijn geliefde te worden begraven na meer dan 100 jaar wil het vaticaan die rust verstoren zodat ze kunnen verbergen dat er kardinalen waren die mannen liefhadden het is een beschamend en onterend verraad van de homohatende kerk tegenover de kardinaal
7876549 het heropgraving past in een proces van canonisatie waarbij de overblijfselen van de kardinaal naar een plaats zullen gebracht worden waar pelgrims makkelijk naar toe kunnen om de heilige in wording te aanbidden
7876550 niemand betwist dat de kardinaal en de priester erg veel van elkaar hielden hij zei zelfs dat zijn verdriet na de dood van st john vergelijkbaar was met dat van een partner die haar of zijn partner verliest maar daarmee bedoelde hij niet dat het huwelijk hetzelfde is als een homoseksuele relatie het is fout om met de ogen van vandaag de teksten van toen te lezen de relaties in de victoriaanse tijd konden heel intens en passioneel zijn maar ze waren niet seksueel het celibaat werd gerespecteerd daar zijn heel veel bewijzen van

7876583 door de uitzonderlijke natte weersomstandigheden van de laatste weken in vlaanderen konden op vele landbouwgronden de oogstwerkzaamheden nog niet doorgaan hierdoor kunnen ook de voorbereiding en bemestingswerkzaamheden op het veld niet tijdig gebeuren

7876592 het is triestig dat het zover is moeten komen waarschijnlijk door de toenemende mate van rechtszaken die ouders opstarten wegens onverantwoordelijke acties van de school
7876593 het gaat om gymnastiekoefeningen die zonder toezicht worden uitgevoerd wij denken eerst aan de veiligheid van de kinderen niet aan mogelijk rechtszaken
7876594 er is nog maar een vijftal expedities uitgevoerd naar het wrak
7876595 onder meer national geographic en the history channel probeerden al te achterhalen wat het schip tot zinken heeft gebracht
7876596 het is een homofobe reactie van de katholieke kerk die probeert te verstoppen dat er homoseksuele priesters bestaan
7876597 de beslissing van het vaticaan om een lichaam uit zijn rustplaats te halen is gravenschennis en religieuze ontheiliging het schendt de uitdrukkelijke wens van de kardinaal om voor eeuwig naast zijn geliefde te worden begraven na meer dan 100 jaar wil het vaticaan die rust verstoren zodat ze kunnen verbergen dat er kardinalen waren die mannen liefhadden het is een beschamend en onterend verraad van de homohatende kerk tegenover de kardinaal
7876598 het heropgraving past in een proces van canonisatie waarbij de overblijfselen van de kardinaal naar een plaats zullen gebracht worden waar pelgrims makkelijk naar toe kunnen om de heilige in wording te aanbidden
7876599 niemand betwist dat de kardinaal en de priester erg veel van elkaar hielden hij zei zelfs dat zijn verdriet na de dood van st john vergelijkbaar was met dat van een partner die haar of zijn partner verliest maar daarmee bedoelde hij niet dat het huwelijk hetzelfde is als een homoseksuele relatie het is fout om met de ogen van vandaag de teksten van toen te lezen de relaties in de victoriaanse tijd konden heel intens en passioneel zijn maar ze waren niet seksueel het celibaat werd gerespecteerd daar zijn heel veel bewijzen van

7876610 we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and finally yes we will
7876611 this november the torch with be passed again to a new generation of americans
7876612 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7876613 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7876614 more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7876615 every major piece of legislation in that time hes had an impact on one way or the other
7876616 hes been a great mentor and a great teacher ive learned an enormous amount
7876617 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
7876618 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars
7876619 we think of segments of individuals who share certain attitudes and needs
7876620 women will often follow because they want to keep a family plan
7876621 for men its all about the bluetooth and belt clip ive never actually seen a woman walking around with a phone on her belt

7876630 its not a good number aint no doubt about that
7876631 it leaves the euro under a lot of pressure without any doubt certainly this reinforces the markets view that the ecbs next move will be a cut not a rise and that a move may come in the next six months or so
7876632 right after the ecb rate hike in july germany may be falling into recession instead
7876633 with spain turning down italy struggling and france losing a lot of momentum too a serious german downturn would not bode well for the euro zone as a whole as well to put it mildly
7876634 false choice between liberties we cherish and security we demand
7876635 we democrats reject illegal wiretapping of american citizens we reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime

7876639 i thought get over yourself i had literally written out a check to the obama campaign and then i saw him in front of an evangelical group in anaheim
7876640 if we always vote for the lesser of two evils if we accept their crumbs and platitudes if we write checks to candidates who dont stand up for us arent we being self destructive

7876647 weve been telling members of congress about this and they seem to be listening
7876648 were seeing heads shaking on both sides of the aisle on this issue
7876649 they are more educated as they have watched the process and the mega mergers over the years they are interested in making competition vibrant
7876650 what we intend and what enfolds are sometimes a completely different thing
7876651 if you look around the world particularly to those nations that are ahead of the u s in broadband youll see that they required the incumbent to share networks
7876652 we see the copper as a natural resource paid for by rate of return regulation
7876653 that once we request usage of the equipment and they have to maintain it the state commission always gives them a fair rate of return
7876654 a few months ago the court refused to take fcc excuses and demanded that the fcc render a formal justification of its decision by november 5 2008 or they would roll back the clock at amp t and verizon and embarq have all filed their proposals and were responding to those petitions

7876657 the process is simple someday homeowners will even be able to print sheets of these solar cells with inexpensive home based inkjet printers consumers can then slap the finished product on a wall roof or billboard to create their own power stations solar cells can be inexpensively printed or simply painted on exterior building walls and or roof tops

7876677 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver i understand some folks may not like that but you know im a job applicant
7876678 why is the smaller unit priced higher than the larger one
7876679 since there is a much smaller demand for the 2 5 gallon unit and we sell so few of them we have to charge more
7876680 does this same unit cost 30 dollars less on the website
7876681 ok but you do stock this item in your store correct
7876682 then can you explain the 30 dollar difference between the store price and my price if i ordered it from the website
7876683 now is the right time to move forward with the transition from icd 9 to icd 10
7876684 we recognize that the transition to icd 10 will require some upfront costs but each year of delay would create additional costs both because of the limitations of icd 9 and because of the need to employ the greater precision that icd 10 codes provide to support value based purchasing of health care and other initiatives we will continue to work collaboratively across the health care system to ensure a smooth transition to use of the updated transaction standards and icd 10

7876767 when these loans dont get paid the taxpayers are going to have to cover them
7876768 everyone likes to portray these foundations as groups that are helping out the poor and getting them into home ownership but it is all about getting around laws and inflating prices in the market that house went from 85 000 to 93 000 the borrower now has a bigger loan to cover thats not helping the poor

7876782 politicians are rewarded when they advance policies that produce immediate benefits to their constituents while spreading costs to others in the future in a world of cheap energy the opportunities forgone by restricting energy exploitation on large areas of federal land such as the outer continental shelf ocs were relatively low some 85 percent of the ocs is still off limits but political protection can be fleeting recall that during the october 16 1973 opec oil embargo the proposed alaskan pipeline had been bottled up in congressional debate for over a decade after the embargo hit pipeline authorization passed within a week without constraints by further administrative or judicial delay or impediment this is an important lesson in the limits of the purely political approach

7876788 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels

7877008 theres something in the four quartets about language that doesnt disintegrate thats what i try to do write sentences that wont be like sand castles ive gotten to the point where i seem to recognize a good sentence when ive written it on the typewriter often its surrounded by junk so im extremely careful if a good sentence occurs in an otherwise boring paragraph i cut it out rubber cement it to a sheet of typewriter paper and put it in a folder its just like catching fish in a creek i pull out a sentence and slip a line through the gills and put it on a chain and am very careful not to mislay it sometimes i try that sentence in ten different places until finally it finds the place where it will stay where the surrounding sentences attach themselves to it and it becomes part of them in the end what i write is almost entirely made up of those sentences which is why what i write now is so short they come out one by one and sometimes in dubious company those sentences that are really valuable are mysterious perhaps they come from another place the way lyric poetry comes from another place
7877009 so here i am in the middle way having had twenty years twenty years largely wasted the years of lentre deux guerres trying to use words and every attempt is a wholy new start and a different kind of failure because one has only learnt to get the better of words for the thing one no longer has to say or the way in which one is no longer disposed to say it and so each venture is a new beginning a raid on the inarticulate with shabby equipment always deteriorating in the general mess of imprecision of feeling undisciplined squads of emotion and what there is to conquer by strength and submission has already been discovered once or twice or several times by men whom one cannot hope to emulate but there is no competition there is only the fight to recover what has been lost and found and lost again and again and now under conditions that seem unpropitious but perhaps neither gain nor loss for us there is only the trying the rest is not our business
7877010 ever tried ever failed no matter try again fail again fail better
7877011 and every phrase and sentence that is right where every word is at home taking its place to support the others the word neither diffident nor ostentatious an easy commerce of the old and the new the common word exact without vulgarity the formal word precise but not pedantic the complete consort dancing together every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning every poem an epitaph

7877402 my advice to businesses is that if you are there or want to be you have to plan on expropriation so you must structure a deal so that you have very little to lose and if expropriation doesnt happen youre happy you cannot gamble because its clear they the kremlin and their business friends will change the deal on you the minute it interests them
7877403 the problem is that canadians in energy mining or automotive sectors which are considered strategic by the kremlin must be aware of the fact igor sechin one of the top three or four people in russia has ordered that multinationals be subject to very strict tax enforcement
7877404 bp invests in russia then step two because bp knows theres no rule of law in russia lobbies the british government to go easy on russia which is how bp thinks it can increase its political leverage in the kremlin then bp invests more in russia and instead of lobbying russia to improve governance it lobbies its own government at home to be soft on russia

7877431 given our significant international exposure our results may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by currency as weve seen in the last few weeks in particular currency rates can at times be volatile
7877432 we hedge the major cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility as we manage our cash globally
7877433 its very difficult to analyze the effect of currency on the bottom line

7877479 i think we are contenders i think we would be that but we wouldnt have any guarantees
7877480 look at tottenham hotspur they won the league cup last season but their league form suffered they finished 11th through it and you would have never imagined it with the team they had
7877481 newcastle had a really decent run in the uefa cup two years ago
7877482 they were unlucky to lose to alkmaar in the quarter finals but the run took a lot out of them and they werent able to sustain their league form
7877483 so we are capable of contending but whether we are good enough or not is another issue
7877484 i want us to be involved and it will be a big disappointment if we go out of it
7877485 but the whole idea is eventually to build a squad here so we are capable of making a challenge and sustaining it
7877486 at the moment up to christmas time lets stay in all the competitions lets see if we can get a run in the league cup and stay in europe
7877487 but while all that is very exciting we would definitely need the squad to go with it

7877519 jews not the jews shaul is still occupied with the paradox that it is jews not gentiles who are opposing him the usual translation with the definite article which is not present in the greek text pits shaul against the jews as a whole it is therefore effectively antisemitic even if not deliberately so

7877541 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century it was and it was called whiff whaff
7877542 there you have i think the essential difference between us and the rest of the world
7877543 other nations such as the french looked at the dining table and saw the opportunity to have dinner we looked at the dining table and saw the opportunity to play whiff whaff that is why london is the sporting capital of the world i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home

7877552 its not easy being an evolutionist these days you have to feel a pang of pity for the critics at new scientist who have resorted to a new argument against intelligent design the more complex things are the more we see that theres no way intelligence could have created them thats right complexity is now an argument against intelligent design from yesterdays print edition as socrates knew the really intelligent know the limits of their own ability an idea we seem to be relearning you might say supporters of intelligent design have it backwards the more we observe the complex workings of our universe the more we must conclude that no single intelligence could have created them
7877553 hurt the feelings of the members of a religious confession
7877554 publicly by word or through any type of document make fun of their dogmas beliefs rites or ceremonies or publicly humiliate those who profess or practice them
7877555 the important thing about intelligent design is that it is not a theory which is something i think they need to make more clear nor is intelligent design an explanation intelligent design is a challenge its a challenge to evolution it does not replace evolution with something else
7877556 no you see intelligent design doesnt tell you what is true it tells you what is not true it tells you that it cannot be that this whole process was random
7877557 we are patient although the government has betrayed us once again

7877560 to test this idea hagemann and colleagues chose recruited 42 seasoned referees who between them had over 320 years of experience at judging tae kwon do matches the judges watched one of two sets of videos clips showing matches between contestants who wore red or blue gear both sets of clips were completely identical save for one key difference in one the experimenters had digitally swapped the colours of the fighters clothes the referees watched the matches and following the rules of the world taekwondo federation awarded their points and when hagemann tallied up the scores he found that the red fighters scored on average 13 more points than the blue ones when a blue competitor was digitally transformed into a red one his points tended to rise but a red competitor who was turned into a blue one was awarded lower scores neither set of clips was given a higher total number of points its a very neat result with a bit of digital sleight of hand hagemann found that referees will assign more points to red clothed contestants than they would to blue clothed ones even if their performance is exactly the same
7877561 childhood vaccination rates for measles continue to exceed 92 percent but outbreak pockets seem to be forming health officials said of this years total 122 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status some were unvaccinated because the children were under age 1 making them too young to get their first measles shot in 63 of those cases almost all of them 19 or younger the patient or their parents refused vaccination the cdc reported in washington state an outbreak was traced to a religious conference including 16 school aged children who were not vaccinated because of parents beliefs eleven of those kids were home schooled and not subject to vaccination rules in public schools

7877564 president bush did make a bad mistake in the war on terrorism but the mistake was not his decision to go to war in iraq bushs mistake came in his belief that this country is the same one his father fought for in wwii it is not
7877565 back then they had just come out of a vicious depression
7877566 teachers in schools actually started the day off with a pledge of allegiance and with prayers for our country and our troops
7877567 back then no newspaper would have dared point out certain weak spots in our cities where bombs could be set off to cause the maximum damage
7877568 a newspaper would have been laughed out of existence if it had complained that german or japanese soldiers were being tortured by being forced to wear womens underwear or subjected to interrogation by a woman or being scared by a dog or did not have air conditioning
7877569 there were a lot of things different back then we were not subjected to a constant bombardment of pornography perversion and promiscuity in movies or on radio we did not have legions of crack heads dope pushers and armed gangs roaming our streets
7877570 no president bush did not make a mistake in his handling of terrorism he made the mistake of believing that we still had the courage and fortitude of our fathers he believed that this was still the country that our fathers fought so dearly to preserve it is not the same country it is now a cross between sodom and gomorra and the land of oz we did unite for a short while after 9 11 but our attitude changed when we found out that defending our country would require some sacrifices
7877571 we are in great danger the terrorists are fanatic muslims they believe that it is okay even their duty to kill anyone who will not convert to islam it has been estimated that about one third or over three hundred million muslims are sympathetic to the terrorists cause hitler and tojo combined did not have nearly that many potential recruits so we either win it or lose it and you aint gonna like losing
7877572 america is not at war the military is at war america is at the mall
7877573 those on the left regard themselves as the moral as well as intellectual superiors of those on the right because they claim to see shades of gray whereas conservatives see only black and white the problem is that most things are black and white and the inability to realize that doesnt suggest clearer vision but only lack of courage and conviction
7877574 so while those on the right are convinced that capitalism for instance is better than communism and socialism and have no problem saying as much liberals go around parroting sound bites
7877575 either you are with us or you are against us
7877576 to fervently ask god for his undeserved mercy on the nation
7877577 we believe god wants revival to break out all across america but it will only happen as believers humble themselves and pray
7877578 the key to revival in america is constant corporate prayer and so we urge all our viewers to participate and if they cant attend in person to please tune in
7877579 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7877580 we really have no good reason to believe in gods but we are all doomed to misery like those evil atheists if we dont believe so believe anyway
7877581 2 without god there is no objective meaning to life we are all merely random creations of natural selection whose existence has no more intrinsic purpose or meaning than that of a pebble equally randomly produced
7877582 3 life is ultimately a tragic fare if there is no god we live we suffer we die some horrifically many prematurely and there is only oblivion afterward
7877583 4 human beings need instruction manuals this is as true for acting morally and wisely as it is for properly flying an airplane ones heart is often no better a guide to what is right and wrong than it is to the right and wrong way to fly an airplane the post religious secular world claims to need no manual the heart and reason are sufficient guides to leading a good life and to making a good world
7877584 5 if there is no god the kindest and most innocent victims of torture and murder have no better a fate after death than do the most cruel torturers and mass murderers only if there is a good god do mother teresa and adolf hitler have different fates
7877585 7 without god people in the west often become less not more rational it was largely the secular not the religious who believed in the utterly irrational doctrine of marxism it was largely the secular not the religious who believed that mens and womens natures are basically the same that perceived differences between the sexes are all socially induced religious people in judeo christian countries largely confine their irrational beliefs to religious beliefs theology while the secular without religion to enable the non rational to express itself end up applying their irrational beliefs to society where such irrationalities do immense harm
7877586 8 if there is no god the human being has no free will he is a robot whose every action is dictated by genes and environment only if one posits human creation by a creator that transcends genes and environment who implanted the ability to transcend genes and environment can humans have free will
7877587 9 if there is no god humans and other animals are of equal value only if one posits that humans not animals are created in the image of god do humans have any greater intrinsic sanctity than baboons this explains the movement among the secularized elite to equate humans and animals
7877588 10 without god there is little to inspire people to create inspiring art that is why contemporary art galleries and museums are filled with art that celebrates the scatological the ugly and the shocking compare this art to michelangelos art in the sistine chapel the latter elevates the viewer because michelangelo believed in something higher than himself and higher than all men
7877589 11 without god nothing is holy this is definitional holiness emanates from a belief in the holy this explains for example the far more widespread acceptance of public cursing in secular society than in religious society to the religious there is holy speech and profane speech in much of secular society the very notion of profane speech is mocked
7877590 12 without god humanist hubris is almost inevitable if there is nothing higher than man no supreme being man becomes the supreme being
7877591 13 without god there are no inalienable human rights evolution confers no rights molecules confer no rights energy has no moral concerns that is why americas founders wrote in the declaration of independence that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights rights depend upon a moral source a rights giver
7877592 14 without god dostoevsky famously wrote all is permitted there has been plenty of evil committed by believers in god but the widespread cruelties and the sheer number of innocents murdered by secular regimes specifically nazi fascist and communist regimes dwarfs the evil done in the name of religion
7877593 as noted at the beginning none of this proves or even necessarily argues for gods existence it makes the case for the necessity not the existence of god

7877623 you get a lot of info about the girl but id rather you get a lot of liking from her

7877625 know the girl make friends with her first and develop from there
7877626 this is a difficult week to put trades on given light volumes but evidence is mounting that europes economy is not only slowing but will accompany the u s in a recession
7877627 germanys economic data is looking pretty bad and as the saying goes as germany goes so goes the continent
7877628 its been a tough place to come over the last few seasons we were hoping to add more goals but to get a clean sheet and a win after the draw with newcastle was vital
7877629 half the team talk was about the importance of getting the first win and its something all us players discussed as well we did enough to win even by a couple more goals i dont think many teams will come here and keep a clean sheet and get three points so weve got to be pleased
7877630 weve got to be confident in our back four and they showed their quality tonight against a very physically strong portmouth side

7877632 todays announcement by president dmitry medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
7877633 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine tomorrow to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
7877634 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7877635 does anybody actually read porters books or are they all bluffing like me
7877636 there have been spousal speeches theyve been successful on a scale of 1 to 10 i would say and journalists write the first rough draft of history that this one at this stage seems to be a successful one
7877637 i thought it was a beautiful speech beautifully delivered and if i can play fashion critic there i thought that michelle obama looked just beautiful but i cant help but feel after this first night of the convention that it was a largely wasted night i cant imagine what this night did for the campaign i mean i know what they were trying to do which is to humanize barack obama to show that the obamas come out of the mainstream but i keep thinking back to what bill and hillary clinton used to say in 1992 about all their scandals they said people the voters of america care more about their futures than they do about the clintons past and i think they care more about their futures than they do about the obamas past there are only four precious nights in this convention and again i cant help but feel it was a largely wasted night
7877638 she is not a liability shes a great asset and thats a great story about america in the sense that both of these young people could come to this place what still has to be answered well of course for this week is what are his qualifications to be president of the united states i mean theres plenty of qualifications and hes made a great contribution to society as has she but what is qualifications to be president of the united states and at the end of the day thats where we have to get to but i think she did a great job getting started
7877639 i think with michelle obama i dont think they know how to deploy her yet i think that you have on one hand an assumption that maybe she can appeal really well to suburban women this is a working women this is someone actually very similar only the second potential first lady in a long time who came from a working background the way hillary clinton did so i think that theres some hope inside the obama campaign that she will connect to middle class middle aged women
7877640 i thought her speech was incredibly hokey and bringing him in on that camera with the kids was cuteness squared but it worked it worked because i think the democrats view this as an election were the opposition is so strong like 1980 that they simply have to have the candidates meet a threshold where hes acceptable and the two problems for obama is the question of his exoticism and the question of his hollowness and shallowness now that second question is to be addressed in the next three days with the hard hitting addresses and the eight point programs and the obama speech at that stadium but tonight was addressed at the exoticism the point of michelle obamas speech was to normalize a man who has an exotic and unusual american history and i thought it was done very well the point of that speech was not the text it was the portraiture and it was the portrait of her family the portrait of her parents as she was growing up and the portrait of her family now and it was the all american cleaver beaver family father knows best it had all the hokum elements exactly what youd want
7877641 michelle obama gave a fine speech in many ways with many good touches but i think it will be looked upon as a bit of a missed opportunity because america has a sense of obama as the messiah as the great leader they do not have a sense of the man in his everyday life and i thought michelle obama was uniquely positioned to give america a sense of who he was normally just day to day and i dont think she really tried to do that i dont think she really did that i would have liked to have seen a little more of that less messiah a little more heres the guy and i think she missed that chance but nonetheless it was a good night for the democrats
7877642 im very proud of michelle she was graceful she told the story of not just her own life but about being raised in a working class family but i think she connected senator obamas biography to that of ordinary americans who are looking for a president who really understands their daily struggles so i thought she gave a very moving personal portrait
7877643 thank you thank you my 13th time that ive been on your show i hope its a lucky one
7877644 13s a charm thats what they say i know you have a birthday friday
7877645 again we were going to have a cake but the fire marshal said that many candles is dangerous now weve done a few jokes about this
7877646 now let me ask you something barack obama named joe biden as his running mate what is your relationship with him all of a sudden its gotten so nasty in the last day or two
7877647 my how hes changed joe we hardly knew ye i guess its part of politics ive always been good friends with joe he has a lovely wife jill and cindy and i and joe and jill have been friends only 72 days i think whos counting
7877648 let me ask you something wasnt biden the one that suggested you run as vice president with john kerry
7877649 yes and said that i could run on either party and be great for america well keep reminding him of that but joe biden is a fine man and good friend and hell make a good running mate for senator obama we just have differences on political philosophy senator obama was the most liberal and joe biden was the third most liberal senators in the senate according to their voting records and thats what this is about

7877654 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort but where he stands at times of challenge and discovery
7877655 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference we know the money is really important but now we are so close to the end of the transfer window it wont make a massive difference
7877656 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game and have enough confidence so that we arent talking about if we have money or not
7877657 the team wasnt good enough around them but i think both players were linking well and the understanding is improving
7877658 we know we have enough quality and good players to win this game
7877659 ive seen a lot of areas we need to improve in over the last three games we have been analysing the games and the reasons why and we need to get back to our form in the pre season games when we were scoring lots of goals

7877662 russias behaviour cannot be condoned or excused whatever the wisdom of some of georgias actions that is not a justification for an all powerful neighbour to invade a small sovereign country
7877663 russias pretext that it has a right to step in militarily to protect its citizens has chilling echoes from czech history and dangerous implications if it is now the basis of russian policy such a doctrine cannot be allowed to stand
7877664 free and democratic nations are entitled to see their territorial integrity respected
7877665 we are fortunate that our generation grew up as the cold war was passing into the history books and a happier era dawned in which a more cooperative relationship with russia seemed possible we hope it still is
7877666 but we should not forget that the lessons of 1968 apply still in 2008 that we must be strong and vigilant in defence of our values and not look the other way when a small independent country is invaded by its neighbour
7877667 we must use the leverage we have we may need russian gas but russia needs our market
7877668 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels
7877669 young people and their parents continually ask for sex and relationships to be taught in schools
7877670 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7877671 we have held a review into the delivery and content of sex and relationships education and will report back in due course
7877672 speaking of the public figure going down the tubes todd bentley now carries the label of a liar and a deceiver first of all todd has been removed from public ministry until further notice he has resigned from the ministry he founded fresh fire so he is no longer a part of that board it has become clear that he indulged in periodic drunkenness he has no intention at the moment of reconciling with shonna nor does she with him their marriage has been torn for years by his emotional attachment with at least one other female whose physical contact went beyond hugging and kissing and holding hands enough said maybe more details will be revealed later but it was clearly immoral all of this was skillfully concealed by lying and by swearing close associates who had observed his behavior to secrecy stephen strader for example knew nothing of this before june 23 apparently some of his board members did but they did not have the ability to deal with it
7877673 the only thing that i have received from the lord about this matter directly is that

7877703 because of the bush administrations highly successful propaganda campaigns and a huge media failure in the united states most americans didnt realize until recently how often the bush administration has violated domestic and international law
7877704 much of what we know about the run up to the iraq war has come from whistleblowers its also because of whistleblowers that americans have learned about the prison abuse at abu ghraib warrantless wiretapping in the u s etc the press can make the information so well known that the administration cannot ignore it as soon as cbss 60 minutes broadcast some of the photos from abu ghraib the bush administration was forced to deal with the scandal
7877705 on march 16 the new york times presented a discussion of the iraq war with nine experts on military and foreign affairs all of whom supported george w bushs invasion of iraq
7877706 as fair asked in a march 17 action alert why should the debate over the war be restricted to those who made erroneous predictions about the invasion
7877707 over the course of the iraq war many commentators have pointed out that the pundits and analysts who pushed for the iraq invasion in the first place are still dominant figures in the media debate over the war as if the fact that they were wrong were unimportant or even evidence of their seriousness
7877708 amazingly prescient about the course in iraq they were criticizing internally before they left office
7877709 much of the world considers our statements about iraq as arrogant untruthful and masking a hidden agenda i strongly believe the probable response of many arabs of the region and muslims of the world if the u s enters iraq without unsc united nations security council agreement will result in actions extraordinarily dangerous to america and americans
7877710 a fair study examines all 393 on camera sources appearing in stories about iraq on abc world news tonight cbs evening news nbc nightly news and pbss newshour with jim lehrer beginning one week before and ending one week after colin powells february 5 presentation at the u n the study finds that while war skeptics are rarely seen on the network newscasts 76 percent of all sources were current or former government officials at a time when 61 percent of respondents were telling cbs pollsters they felt the u s should wait and give the united nations and weapons inspectors more time just 6 percent of u s sources were skeptics about the need for war just 3 of 393 sources were identified with anti war activism
7877711 do you all remember scott ritter you know the former chief u n weapons inspector who played chief stooge for saddam hussein
7877712 well mr ritter actually told a french radio network that quote the united states is going to leave baghdad with its tail between its legs defeated sorry scott i think youve been chasing the wrong tail again
7877713 a nation at war outlawed weapons some skeptics say arms hunt is fruitless
7877714 in a major article in the new york times this weekend reporter judith miller admitted she was wrong when she wrote several of the key articles that claimed iraq had an extensive weapons of mass destruction program ahead of the 2003 invasion
7877715 today we are joined by someone who was not wrong about weapons of mass destruction in iraq scott ritter
7877716 he was the united nations top weapons inspector in iraq at unscom between 1991 and 1998 before working at the un he served as an officer in the us marines and as a ballistic missile adviser to general schwarzkopf in the first gulf war scott ritter has just published a new book titled iraq confidential the untold story of the intelligence conspiracy to undermine the un and overthrow saddam hussein the book details how the cia manipulated and sabotaged the work of un departments to achieve the foreign policy agenda of the united states in the middle east
7877717 pandora cant go back in the box he only comes out
7877718 my dad went to war and never came back he is buried at bomana war cemetery at port moresby
7877719 my dear mother had to bring up three children by herself i was four my brother three and sister one
7877720 that was tough times for her like many families who lost their loved ones in the war
7877721 we had legacy evenings and sporting groups and all sorts of beaut things we would do so that was wonderful and they were a great support for mum
7877722 we came from vite vite near skipton but they helped mum find a two roomed home in ballarat and mum had a legatee who would look after her and the family
7877723 that support continued right throughout our schooling years both physically in the sense they would keep an eye on the house and emotionally
7877724 we dont receive any government funding or grants so we have to raise our own money
7877725 legacy week provides the means for us to do that and its also an opportunity for the community to recognise the work legacy does for those who dont have people to look after them
7877726 apart from our principal concern which is the care of war widows and dependents we do things like run computer literacy classes for widows
7877727 we are particularly pleased about the state governments renewed commitment to the public tafe system and the governments intention that our tafes should continue to be leaders across the nation
7877728 it is clear that the government has paid attention to the large number of submissions it received about reforming the victorian training system
7877729 we think this is a bold reform package from the state government and one which seeks to position our tafe system both nationally and internationally
7877730 clearly the original claim was an attempted fraud and appropriately rejected
7877731 those who submitted and certified it should be ashamed of themselves
7877732 the university has reached a settlement with dr mcmaster and we cannot comment on any outstanding grievance issues concerning him
7877733 i make these requests in the name of your son jesus
7877734 i understand that we have people present who like vanilla strawberry and chocolate but you should know that im a butter pecan guy and it would be good for other fans of butter pecan to hear me saying it from this podium
7877735 the association believes that any amount of fraud is unacceptable and that better controls at the front end of the process are needed to keep criminals out of the medicare program in the first place
7877736 the democrat no energy policy is hurting tennesseans at the gas pump and now it will hurt them every time they turn on the light switch
7877737 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7877738 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7877739 they threatened our lives threatened the lives of people we know of our family members and they told us that they could get us even outside of china

7877745 they have sought reconsideration of our decision and that process is underway
7877746 they formally apply for it and it will involve another full audit of the home and how they are managing and providing care for residents
7877747 we are still going there quite frequently but we were there everyday while serious risk of harm was present to residents but that was resolved some little while back
7877748 the agency had previously advised that it would revoke kirralees accreditation on september 17 unless non compliant issues identified in july were rectified
7877749 kirralee is seeking a stay of this decision in the aat at kirralees request the agency has sent an assessment team to review the facility we hope that this review coupled with the agency decision a fortnight ago to lift the serious risk findings will provide more certainty for kirralee residents and staff
7877750 in consultation with senior management a decision will soon be made on how resources will be allocated within the ballarat police service area to establish the new family violence unit
7877751 the establishment of a dedicated unit will not only result in a greater response to family violence incidents but it will also allow operational units to focus on other policing priorities
7877752 it is only a six month pilot program but clearly its hoped that it will become a permanent program
7877753 we are happy to see these sorts of initiatives and there is certainly a need for it but the personnel really need to be funded separately by government rather than taking them from existing areas if you pull numbers away from there to support these unfunded initiatives you cant have the capacity to respond to calls from the public and you certainly dont have the ability to do preventative patrolling
7877754 i know they the tell the truth coalition have a point to make and they want to make that point pretty forcefully
7877755 but if they have a view to put forward in this debate putting images like that in front of a seven year old just going to the letterbox is not very helpful
7877756 all we can hope is to have a mature and sensible debate on the issue
7877757 people are living longer and the diseases that used to kill them such as heart attacks strokes and diabetes we are better able to control
7877758 our growth has been at 20 per cent every year for the past four years
7877759 theres a wider range of options now for example there are now a few different chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer
7877760 our aim is to provide the best quality of care for people who come through the door
7877761 as well because treatments have improved local doctors are happier to refer patients
7877762 we have the ability to treat just about everything here
7877763 he has very little if any recollection of the night
7877764 this improves care for the patients as well because they get to be seen by a senior registrar

7877800 farm notes sustainable farms in the media small sustainable farmers are all over the media lately a few years back hearty roots might have been in an occasional story in our local paper or a food related magazine these days we have literally been inundated with requests from filmmakers tv and radio producers and editors of books newspapers and magazines in fact this week in brooklyn we will have a crew from japanese public television nhk filming distribution of the vegetables this past weekend stoneledge farm which is in a neighboring county to ours had a film crew from abc news documenting their garlic harvest for a national tv feature and last week i was invited to speak on the radio about the economics of small farming on wnycs brian lehrer show in the past few months alone the new york times has featured stories on young urbanites becoming farmers corporate executives switching to the farm lifestyle csa in general and people hiring gardeners to create their own organic csas in their back yards is this just a fad or is there something going on to merit all this attention judging by our experience at hearty roots this is more than just media hype were in the midst of a local food and farming movement whose growth is momentous hearty roots has seen unprecedented demand for our csa shares this season selling out far earlier than we ever have before we are seeing new farms pop up and hearing from many people who are excited about learning to farm weve been forced to turn down many neighborhoods restaurants and specialty stores interested in getting our produce since even though we have grown our farm by nearly 100 percent each season we are still unable to keep up with demand so whats next in order for this local food movement to keep up with the media attention and demand from a locavore savvy public we need more farmers even in our area which faces development pressure due to its proximity to nyc there is lots of land that is currently growing low value crops like hay land that could be used to grow higher value crops to meet nycs demand for fresh local produce it will be no easy task to achieve this we need changes in local state and federal policy we need young people who are working for farmers now to have the tools they need to launch their own farms we need to protect our existing farmland from development and we need existing commodity farmers to diversify into direct marketing it wont happen overnight but now is the time to build our capacity for a strong local sustainable agricultural sector in the future

7877811 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7877812 fewer than half had external injuries that could have been caused by collision
7877813 wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7877814 formally agreed to make developers aware of the risks and find ways of monitoring bat migration routes

7877824 the kids love football but at the end of the day our goal is to make sure they get their diploma
7877825 i wasn t thinking as far as college when i was in high school
7877826 in school we had such a great time playing football side by side i thought how could we not get involved i liked the ability to see directly where the funds were going
7877827 and the fact that in a few years these two will be helping other students that were in their situation just four years ago
7877828 everyone was going to college and i followed in their footsteps
7877829 i remember one play where jose broke his finger he screamed my name after that i told him
7877830 and i don t understand why more businesses like my brother now gumbs and his younger brother attend universities

7877861 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven

7877863 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
7877864 if we then are to have fellowship with jesus christ in his present work we must spend much time in prayer we must give ourselves to earnest constant persistent sleepless overcoming prayer i know of nothing that has so impressed me with a sense of the importance of praying at all seasons being much and constantly in prayer as the thought that that is the principal occupation at present of my risen lord i want to have fellowship with him and to that end i have asked the father that whatever else he may make me to make me at all events an intercessor to make me a man who knows how to pray and who spends much time in prayer
7877865 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
7877866 please call me passion because i am always very passionate and nothing else could more precisely describe me
7877867 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
7877868 you have not only the problem of an intellectual grasp but also a sense of personal vileness which is almost too much to bear
7877869 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding
7877870 we give glory to god it may be taken not as a petition but as an adoration as that the lord be magnified or glorified for gods holiness is the greatness and glory of all his perfections
7877871 indicating what feature of those beatific visions had most impressed him
7877872 and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee
7877873 for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth
7877874 the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the lord and it shall be a place for their houses and an holy place for the sanctuary
7877875 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
7877876 but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord
7877877 these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord
7877878 repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
7877879 be ye holy for i am holy but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
7877880 and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
7877881 now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation
7877882 and he said draw nigh hither put off thy shoes off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground

7877967 my colleagues and i have had complaints about flooding right across greasby from arrowe road to frankby road the cause of the flooding appears to be lack of capacity in the main sewers we ve asked for a meeting with united utilities

7878023 entre otras cosas hay mucha de psicolog a envuelta en la magia
7878024 hay magia negra y hay lo que llamamos magia blanca es decir la magia utilizada solamente para entretener
7878025 nosotros los magos no usamos magia negra lo nuestro es puramente ciencia con el uso de ptica luces sonido sentidos y much sima psicolog a tomamos ventaja del precondicionamiento que ha sido instalado en la gente a trav s de la vida cotidiana somos actores que usamos la magia como medio de entretenimiento para recuperar a ese ni o maravillado que ramos cuando est bamos creciendo
7878026 a veces si la gente no puede explicar un show o un truco dicen que es magia negra
7878027 primero y principal tienes que decidir el tipo de magia que quieres hacer por ejemplo un show en un bar es diferente que uno en un escenario es un diferente estilo de magia con diferentes principios y diferente preparaci n luego debes comprender los principios de la magia y c mo aplicarlos con efectividad a los principios que uses
7878028 desafortunadamente alguna gente primero compra un truco usualmente el que es barato y despu s trabaja para introducirlo en el show
7878029 nuestro trabajo principal como ilusionistas es crear una historia o escena para la audiencia y entonces llevarla a trav s de ese viaje para hacer eso utilizamos los principios de la ingenier a la f sica la ciencia la qu mica y la psicolog a una mezcla de todo eso
7878030 una de las primeras cosas que aprend sobre la magia fue que hay una fuerte relaci n entre hacer magia y jugar ajedrez cuanto m s puedas prever m s efectivos ser n tu juego o tu magia si puedes anticipar los movimientos de otras personas al mismo tiempo que planificar los tuyos propios estar s muy por delante de tu audiencia y ser s capaz de asombrarla con regularidad
7878031 cuando act as para un ni o es mucho m s desafiante adultos no hay problema

7878094 nach dem desaster von br nn fahre ich im glauben nach misano dass alles besser laufen wird und dass wir beim zweiten heim grand prix des teams ein gutes resultat nach hause fahren k nnen ich bin wieder gut drauf und beim test nach dem tschechien grand prix fand ich ein paar zehntel die f r das n chste rennen hilfreich sein werden
7878095 es ist war immer schon eine tolle serie ich denke dass das die stufe vor der formel 1 ist es sind gro e hersteller involviert die rennen sind eng den fans wird viel geboten wir erwarten uns f r brands hatch viele zuschauer und m chten ihnen eine tolle show bieten
7878096 die tickets sind nicht so teuer man kommt nah an die fahrer man kommt ins fahrerlager man kann einen pitwalk machen die fans bekommen hautnah mit was wir machen zudem hat die itr viele angebote f r fans es gibt viele autogrammstunden damit jeder fan das bekommt was er m chte wir fahrer sehen es so ohne die fans w rden wir nicht rennen fahren wir m ssen ihnen eine gute show bieten damit sie bei jedem rennen wiederkommen

7878104 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7878105 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7878106 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7878107 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7878108 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7878109 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7878110 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7878111 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7878112 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7878113 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7878114 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7878115 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7878127 the speed at which the climate is changing has been significantly underestimated with thousands of australian homes potentially at risk from rising sea levels a conference has heard ports harbours and airports situated near the ocean are also vulnerable to the immediate effects of climate change said keynote speaker jo mummery preliminary modelling has found that if there is a rise in sea levels 269 505 houses could be at risk in nsw and 2 875 houses in the nt
7878128 dr jo mummery from the department of climate change told the delegation that if sea levels rose just one metre exclusive pockets of the gold coast would be completely washed out she says if water enters a 200 metre buffer zone almost 559 000 residential buildings would be affected across the country
7878129 the head of the climate change unit at the australian national university and science adviser to the federal government professor will steffen says he believes the scientific community is underestimating the speed at which the climate is changing
7878130 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change

7878135 water is still considered by many as a cheap and limitless resource the reality is that costs are rising and we are using far too much of it putting pressure on existing supplies
7878136 while cost savings may be a key driver for water conservation companies that do so demonstrate to customers that they are adopting best environmental practice this in itself offers a competitive advantage
7878137 our battery regulations add to the measures that this government has put in place to reduce the impact of waste products on the environment
7878138 they represent a big first step towards implementing the batteries directive as a whole and provide positive contribution to the workings of the internal market and provide a foundation for reducing the environmental impact of the many millions of portable industrial and automotive batteries used in the uk each year

7878142 i had my hands full trying to weave my way in and out i was just going to have to bide my time and go through holes without using my horse when he got left a little bit then i thought oh no i squeezed him just a little bit to get him into the race from then on the race pretty much unfolded the way i wanted the way he ran today was a heck of a performance
7878143 i didnt think we had any chance at the top of the stretch
7878144 i was afraid that they werent going fast enough up front i was looking for a faster pace alan did a great job hes really been unlucky his first race back he was 10 wide at keeneland then we went to pimlico and he had a rough trip he ran back in three weeks on short rest going 10 furlongs but this is what he wants to do hes very sound and he trains good we just wish they ran the bernard baruch twice a year
7878145 i thought we got beat she got the perfect bob
7878146 today and in her last race she had to overcome a lot of things shes in heat and i was a nervous wreck when i saw her in the paddock she was acting as if she was ready to be bred by the way rafael was putting her in a drive i thought she had a lot to do as soon as she got to the quarter pole i knew she had a chance
7878147 i wanted to rule it out just because i dont think the synthetic surface is her favorite track but brereton is still keeping the option open
7878148 its not easy for her to get over it i trained her on the synthetic at fair hill for the alabama because i know she gets a lot out of it because its not easy for her i have learned that training on it and racing on it are two different things
7878149 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
7878150 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20m hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
7878151 it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
7878152 chinas stellar growth in renewable can also be attributed to the speed at which it has built up its supply chain capability to the point where it is likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
7878153 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry

7878170 calls by department of homeland security and u s coast guard officials that recreational boating would be safer if boaters were certified and required to show proof of identification is just not backed up by the facts
7878171 the rate of recreational boating fatalities per 100 000 boats has been cut by 75 percent and the number of boating fatalities has been reduced by 58 percent since 1971
7878172 requiring millions of recreational boat owners to be licensed and tasking the already overburdened coast guard with implementing a duplicative system solely to identify those operating a boat will be costly to develop take years to implement and will not result in a demonstrable improvement in national security

7878193 how to design a good api and why it matters
7878194 i keep my code cleaner and clearer use public attribute as property instead of private attribute and accessor methods
7878195 so we now take the horrific practice of exposing state but at least through accessor methods which makes us less implementation dependent as the method implementation can be changed without effecting the signature and return type
7878196 80 of getter and setter are the stupid code lot of time generated by ide if you change the implementation
7878197 i think that simple readable code is more upgradeable and easiest to maintain than code with academic heavy pattern
7878198 about avoid usage of getter setter i was for it if we take the printme toxml examples im against you show internal state into predefined format those format arent usable without some processing to extract information what append if i want another format what append if i want to use gui
7878199 one vision privileges the designer developer making choices and advocates a design good practice hidding state while the other one is more an mda generative approach where the primary concern is to leave the business model as free as possible from design decisions that would pollute it
7878200 you want to postpone design decisions as much as you can
7878201 i think you are talking in terms of trivial apps that are self contained and developed within the same ide thats usually not the case in enterprise apps that reuse various libraries have multiple components layers etc

7878272 that didnt have any influence on our decision but some of our sponsors were keen to know what stance the club was going to take
7878273 i think they were satisfied by how we have handled it
7878274 im not surprised by anything in the game these days
7878275 you enter you hope for the best and you have to live with what you have delivered
7878276 we havent considered our response yet because we havent had a chance to read the statement yet
7878277 i made it clear we cant make exceptions under the salary cap despite his status in the game
7878278 i used the example of someone like terry campese hes not in the top five players in the game but hes just as important to the raiders as greg is to the storm
7878279 one of the lessons we from the mark gasnier situation was to make sure the player knew the rules direct from us rather than the agent and the club
7878280 the nrl wasnt happy about gasnier and williams going but thats the good thing about gi theres some decency about him
7878281 ive spoken to frank at length and the football department and i believe them when they say he was genuinely injured
7878282 i think were being punished for being a red state
7878283 the consensus is the closer you are the more important you are

7878296 the undersigned hereby certifies that a copy of this paper has been served upon all parties at their address record by usps express mail post office to addressee on this date
7878297 thats not good with your expectations to say yeah i think im going to get sent down after each start
7878298 but the last couple starts its hard to think they can give me any more opportunities than they have in this stretch especially with only a month and a half left in the season and the pennant race as close as it is now youve got to send guys out there that you believe theyre going to go out there and give you a win or give you six seven innings and i havent been doing that so i hate to say it was the right decision but i believe it was
7878299 i think we all believe strongly that it will work but at the moment its difficult
7878300 up here youre in a pennant race ive never been one to say that pressure was too much for me but ive felt like ive had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect trying to do everything as well as i could to help this team win and it hasnt been near good enough
7878301 the decision was coming it had to be made soon they had given me ample opportunity to help this team and to help myself out up here and it just hasnt worked out
7878302 i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers at and id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
7878303 the doctors tell us that stuff is cumulative its not something that is a function of one event so i dont think we can hang anybody on that
7878304 he just was concerned and he wanted to make sure he didnt have anything to do with it
7878305 but the all star game was just another step in the process being a lefty specialist and only getting 40 whatever innings the last few years and then all of the sudden having 50 already its just that on top of everything else
7878306 i dont think we were disrespectful or ignorant of him i do understand that now hes on the dl so i called him i dont want to see a kid go on the dl anyway not if i have something to do with it but i dont want them to go on the dl anyway
7878307 its human nature to want to do well especially at home
7878308 the best hope for improving family life today is not to roll back womens rights but to further womens economic and political integration
7878309 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
7878310 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
7878311 refuses to do a book so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
7878312 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
7878313 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

7878368 it took me about half an hour to create the 3d model where it would have taken me a week to do it before
7878369 it allows you to work quickly and answer tons of questions about your design in three dimensions that you wouldnt be able to answer as well by drawing it out on a board
7878370 has proven tricky especially when much of the required data lives in proprietary design systems
7878371 the level of detail may not be there if you want to design a microprocessor or the details of an engine for example
7878372 we were driving a lot to get to clients and show them designs

7878393 parents who are not in receipt of social welfare or family income supplement are now facing into a winter of rising childcare prices which will inevitably result in a number of them either moving to part time employment or leaving work altogether
7878394 last december in the seanad i criticised the narrow and limited focus of the scheme saying that they would do nothing to help the majority of families for whom childcare was difficult to access and very expensive
7878395 parents are now saying that they will have a price hike of up to 100 per cent and for some it will make better economic sense to leave the workforce and care for their children full time
7878396 the minister for children launched these changes by repeatedly emphasising how much money 153 million was being spent on he scheme but again it is those low income families who fall just outside the social welfare criteria who will be hit the most i was told of a family just yesterday who were paying 200 per week for the care of their two children but will now have to pay 360 under the new rules the childrens mother is now considering leaving her job

7878456 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7878457 she must know very well one of the premier works on the subject jesuit john connerys abortion the development of the roman catholic perspective loyola 1977
7878458 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7878459 the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
7878460 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7878461 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
7878462 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7878463 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith

7878492 kaum luth telah mendustakan rasul rasul ketika saudara mereka luth berkata kepada mereka mengapa kamu tidak bertakwa sesungguhnya aku adalah seorang rasul kepercayaan yang diutus kepadamu maka bertakwalah kepada allah dan taatlah kepadaku
7878493 maka tidak lain jawaban kaumnya melainkan mengatakan usirlah luth beserta keluarganya dari negerimu karena sesungguhnya mereka itu orang orang yang mendakwahkan dirinya bersih
7878494 sambutlah tamu tamu perempuan dan tinggalkanlah untuk kami kaum pria
7878495 allah membuat istri nuh dan istri luth perumpamaan bagi orang orang kafir
7878496 datangkanlah kepada kami azab allah jika kamu termasuk orang arang yang benar
7878497 hendaklah kalian tetap di situ sehingga aku memberitahu ayahku dan kemudian akan kembali pada kalian
7878498 ayahku ada pemuda pemuda yang ingin menemuimu di pintu kota aku belum pernah melihat wajah wajah seperti mereka
7878499 saya belum mengetahui kaum yang lebih keji di muka bumi ini selain penduduk negeri ini
7878500 dan tatkala datang utusan utusan kami para malaikat itu kepada luth dia merasa susah dan merasa sempit dadanya karena kedatangan mereka dan dia berkata ini adalah hari yang amat sulit dan datanglah kepadanya kaumnya dengan bergesa gesa dan sejak dahulu mereka selalu melakukan perbuatan perbuatan yang keji
7878501 dia berkata hai kaumku inilah putri putri negeriku mereka lebih suci bagimu maka bertakwalah kepada allah dan janganlah kamu mencemarkan nama ku terhadap tamuku ini tidak adakah di antaramu seorang yang berakal
7878502 di hadapan kalian terdapat wanita wanita di bumi mereka lebih suci bagi kalian dalam bentuk kesucian jiwa dan fisik ketika kalian cen derung kepada mereka maka kecenderungan itu merupakan pelaksanaan dari fitrah yang sehat
7878503 mereka menjawab sesungguhnya kamu telah tahu bahwa kami tidak mempunyai keinginan terhadap putri putrimu dan sesungguhnya kamu tentu mengetahui apa yang sebenarnya kami kehendaki
7878504 luth berkata seandainya aku mempunyai kekuatan untuk menolakmu atau kalau aku dapat berlindung kepada keluarga yang kuat tentu aku lakukan
7878505 allah swt menurunkan rahmat atas nabi luth ia berlindung pada benteng yang kokoh
7878506 para utusan malaikat berkata hai luth sesungguhnya kami adalah utusan utusan tuhanmu sekali sekali mereka tidak akan dapat mengganggu kamu
7878507 dan sesungguhnya mereka telah membujuknya agar menyerahkan tamunya kepada mereka lalu kami butakan mata mereka maka rasakanlah azab ku dan ancaman ancaman ku dan sesungguhnya pada esok harinya mereka ditimpa azab yang kekal
7878508 pergilah dengan membawa keluarga dan pengikut pengikut kamu di akhir malam dan janganlah ada seorang pun di antara kalian yang tertinggal kecuali istrimu sesungguhnya dia akan ditimpa azab yang menimpa mereka karena sesungguhnya saat jatuhnya azab kepada mereka adalah di waktu subuh bukankah subuh itu sudah dekat
7878509 maka tatkala datang azab kami kami jadikan negeri kaum luth itu yang di atas ke bawah kami balikkan dan kami hujani mereka dengan batu dari tanah yang terbakar dengan bertubi tubi yang diberi tanda oleh tuhanmu dan siksaan itu tiadalah jauh dari orang orang yang lalim

7878511 lalu kami keluarkan orang orang yang beriman yang berada di negeri kaum luth itu
7878512 dan sesungguhnya kota itu benar benar terletak dijalan yang masih tetap dilalui manusia

7878584 i think its extremely important to just keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7878585 obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7878586 if only id done a head count after i called them all in
7878587 mam whenever we receive an allegation of neglect an investigation must be conducted we need to set up a home interview
7878588 excuse me the police officers told us they had mistakenly made the call to social services that this was clearly not a case of neglect this makes no sense why would you need to conduct a home interview when there are no allegations
7878589 we have a file and that file will need to be closed
7878590 it doesnt matter what the police told you they have their procedures and we have ours this is the procedure when can i set up a home appointment
7878591 im not comfortable with inviting strangers into my home im sure you understand
7878592 weve been in the process of securing a new home since december so no this is not a recent decision
7878593 ill have the worker assigned to this case give you a call to set up an appointment as soon as possible
7878594 we really need statements from the other children in the household
7878595 may i ask why the other children were not missing nor were they party to emilys actions she wandered off on her own her father and i are the ones that can give you any other information you require what possible insight could the other children provide there is no police report naming the other children nor are we legally required to subject them to questioning
7878596 you are correct there is no legal requirement but it would be helpful
7878597 and there are no allegations of neglect so there is no need to interview the children
7878598 will the child in question be allowed to attend the meeting
7878599 ill have to confer with my husband you see mrs x we are good parents and do everything within our power at all times to choose very carefully the people whom we allow to talk to our children i still do not understand what on earth is going on put yourself in my place does this seem reasonable we are told there are no allegations of neglect social services will not be called and now i have your office insisting upon interviewing my entire family this makes no sense whatsoever hasnt anyone even read the police report
7878600 i dont have a copy of the police report though i have requested one much depends upon the police report once i have a copy with the officers statement perhaps our interview will take a different tone
7878601 wait a minute you dont have a copy of the police report i do shall i read it to you
7878602 no mam ill be picking up a copy later today well discuss the report at our meeting
7878603 what if i simply take her with me dressed up like the little doll she is but dont allow them to talk to her

7878606 sudah beberapa dekade saya orang yang memiliki kecintaan terhadap sepatu berwarna coklat saya tidak terlalu suka sepatu berwarna hitam sehingga setiap beli sepatu yang pertama dicari adalah warna coklat soal merek dan harga menjadi pertimbangan kedua tapi kecintaan saya terhadap warna coklat itu ternyata melanggar aturan rumah sakit tentang pakaian seragam di sana disebutkan pakaian seragam perawat adalah bla bla bla dan sepatu hitam tapi saya tidak peduli dengan aturan itu toh hanya melanggar warna kalau saya menggunakan sendal ketika dinas mungkin banyak yang ribut tapi kalau hanya sekedar warna ah masa saya akan dihukum atau mendapat kondite kalau toh mau dicap jelek biar aja itu pikiran saya yang nakal saya ingin merdeka dengan kecintaan saya itu satu hal yang saya inginkan adalah aturan pakaian seragam perawat direvisi dan apa yang terjadi setelah sekian lama saya merdeka dengan sepatu coklatnya ya persis lah seperti yang saya inginkan
7878607 carefully done work of this sort should not be denied the attention of lancet readers
7878608 the authors believe that when these results are taken together with the findings of three similar previous trials it may be time to confront the conclusion that homeopathy and placebo differ
7878609 this may be more plausible than the conclusion that their trials have produced serial false positive results
7878610 a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right that something is impossible he is very probably wrong
7878611 it is true that the shang review included the studies that sic reilly and his team in his initial analysis
7878612 the fact that shang never provided analysis and comparison of the 22 high quality homeopathic trials to the 9 high quality conventional medical studies
7878613 se of log odds ratio language of publication indexing of the publication in medline trial quality masking generation of allocation sequence concealment of allocation intention to treat analysis duration of follow up and clinical topic for homoeopathy trials we also examined whether effects varied between types of homoeopathy and types of indications acute chronic primary prevention or prophylaxis
7878614 combined treatment effects from larger trials of higher quality by use of standard random effects meta analysis and used meta regression analysis to predict treatment effects in trials as large as the largest trials included in the study trials with se in the lowest quartile were defined as larger trials
7878615 shang conveniently disregarded several high quality trials that happened to have
7878616 contains little experimental detail does not report withdrawals and analyses a suspiciously round number of patients
7878617 participants taking oscillococcinum had about a quarter of a day less illness than those on placebo this effect might be as large as
7878618 is based on combining the individually negative results for a secondary outcome from these two studies
7878619 the difference between groups in the meta analysis only just reaches statistical significance it is arguable that a question as scientifically controversial as whether homeopathic medicines are always equivalent to placebo would require more statistically robust data
7878620 her famous study that was published in the respected journal pediatrics
7878621 the meta analysis of the three diarrhea trials that was published in the respect sic journal
7878622 as they were undertaking their own meta analysis and needed to include as they did the data from the individual trials
7878623 showed his dishonesty or ignorance by saying that the reilly trials were not
7878624 the point here is that when you put on blinders you do not see the whole picture
7878625 perhaps someone can finally tell us which were the 21 homeopathic trials and the 9 allopathic ones
7878626 give one you only need one incontrovertible example with references of homeopathy curing a non self limiting condition

7878661 over two decades japanese ships have butchered thousands of whales taken from the icy waters around the antarctic in the name of research

7878675 we are brought together today by the tragic event of 16 august 2008 an event that claimed the life of a blue spader our brother in arms staff sgt kristopher rodgers
7878676 when a tragedy of this magnitude occurs taking from us such a special individual we are left with feeling the sorrow anger and sometimes guilt in order to find peace we come together and share memories we laugh cry and remember the unique qualities that made staff sgt rodgers a patriot and a guardian of freedom
7878677 staff sgt rodgers watched the events of sept 11 2001 unfold and instead of letting others secure his freedom and the freedoms of our great nation he picked up his weapon and made a difference
7878678 what i remember most about staff sgt rodgers is his professionalism loyalty to his men and his good natured demeanor
7878679 regardless of the situation staff sgt rodgers always maintained a positive attitude
7878680 it wasnt always easy for him in recon platoon but he would always listen and take advice from others in order to make his own sops
7878681 he always took care of soldiers and held them responsible for their actions his standards were high but were not unobtainable he expected everyone in his recon team to meet or surpass them
7878682 in addition to being a professional soldier staff sgt rodgers was a good friend loving husband and dedicated father

7878703 the long awaited end of the canadian housing boom has occurred reflecting more moderate demand and increased supply of properties for sale
7878704 with more property listings and a decline in the number of sales prices are not increasing as rapidly now down to single digits overall which is good news from an affordability standpoint
7878705 the housing market is at a balanced state sellers have more competition and buyers have more selection to choose from
7878706 in a balanced market we can generally advise our clients to take a little longer look at a wider variety of properties and negotiate harder when it comes to price

7878713 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7878714 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7878715 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7878716 thus during hard times and resource droughts these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members on the same team

7878720 were trying to teach habits and encourage lifestyles that will allow these students to become the next sustainable consumers of the world
7878721 its definitely a trend right now people are becoming more sure of how they impact the environment the changes that are predicted are in our lifetimes not our parents so its become a little bit more real for us
7878722 theres a need and a want for this kind of lifestyle in the community but there are also many people who arent quite sure what to do about it
7878723 were still in that stage but this is a step in the right direction its making green more important in other peoples lives
7878724 its not really as much protesting as students taking charge
7878725 i guess protest was pretty popular in the 60s i see me and other students doing positive things rather than protesting
7878726 in my generation maybe about 10 percent really care but those who care are really passionate about it
7878727 then there were several generations that were not active at all it impresses me how important the work that young people are now doing is
7878728 now theres an expectation among our students that they give something back
7878729 you walk to a football game and you see them
7878730 i want to change the world but you have to do it one issue at a time
7878731 theres a lot more people going to college these days and we have to ensure were preserving accessibility for everyone
7878732 for far too long we have not had a legitimate place at the table
7878733 they will take off by plane to protest at the republican convention or the world social forum in brazil
7878734 i saw what it was like to live in that kind of poverty
7878735 in the 60s student issues were domestic u s involvement in the vietnam war or the civil rights movement now were looking at globalization and our impact on the world
7878736 i think there is more and more the realization that any human problem it is part of our human lives and we have a role to play
7878737 there are a lot of other areas id rather be working on but because this is my responsibility its what ive been doing
7878738 as if acknowledging that his lead over gop candidate sen john mccain has shrunk heading into the parties nominating conventions and accusing republicans of smearing him out of desperation
7878739 i dont find myself particularly scary or particularly risky but i mean theyre good at it so theyve got these ads with paris hilton and britney spears and theyve got some guy who just wrote a book he just makin stuff up just makes stuff up but it gets a lot of play on fox news after a while people starting thinking god he does have a funny name or believing false rumors about me they get in e mails about obamas religion or patriotism
7878740 if he cant handle a book and the first amendment if hes in the oval office all the enemies of the united states need to do to rattle him is to publish a cartoon about him or write a book
7878741 every minute the obama campaign obsesses on me theyre off message and theyre not answering the fundamental charges i made in the book
7878742 what should i buy for x y and z purposes
7878743 there is no project to dispose of recycling at the parks
7878744 it plays into the theme of the parks about protecting the environment
7878745 we will take care of the bins if they are damaged or overflowing
7878746 there shouldnt be any direct cost to the city because we have people who pull the trash out and they will pull the recycling as well
7878747 i know she has put a lot of effort into this especially to get the grant money
7878748 there are garbage cans out there but its human nature for kids to forget and throw things out
7878749 they use a lot of gatorade and water bottles and just leave them where they are and forget to pick them up
7878750 i want to teach kids it is a privilege to play at the parks
7878751 i want this to teach them to pick up after themselves
7878752 im not a tree hugger but i try to be a step ahead
7878753 grand rapids has a very advanced recycling program and i want that here
7878754 hopefully im not the only one who will graduate and come back here
7878755 i want to make this a nice place for my kids to grow up
7878756 they gave me the nickname the recycle nazi because if i see something in the trash that could be recycled ill take it out put it on the counter and wait for the person to put in the recycling
7878757 i grew up here and i grew up recycling im thankful i have a family that taught me how to recycle and i want to teach others the same
7878758 many youth as well as older sisters appear shy of religious conversation they do not appreciate their opportunities they close the windows of the soul that should be open heavenward and open their windows wide earthward but when they see the excellence of the human soul they will close the windows earthward which depend on worldly amusements and associations in folly and sin and will open the windows heavenward to behold spiritual things the word of god must be their assurance their hope their peace then they can say i will receive the sun of righteousness that it may shine forth to others
7878759 how does the time that i spend in gods word amount to that which i spend chatting to friends ect
7878760 the wails of the worlds sorrow are heard all around us sin is pressing its shadow upon us and our minds must be ready for every good word and work we know that we have the presence of jesus the sweet influence of his holy spirit is teaching and guiding our thoughts leading us to speak words that will cheer and brighten the pathway of others

7878763 fwd fwd fwd fwd pass this on for little jimmy faux
7878764 how much of this is leaching out of landfills is difficult to say but results from a 1999 experiment by timothy g townsend of the florida center for solid and hazardous waste management found that crts leached enough lead in simulated landfill conditions to qualify as toxic waste
7878765 if you are pressing forward and upward seeking to attain new heights in education and in spiritual things you will have discernment to understand that which is required of you you will have the holy spirit to help you all your infirmities it is natural for the youth to love amusement but the natural inclinations must be overcome by putting the soul under the discipline to god walk not hesitatingly but firmly in the strength and grace of jesus christ

7878778 the biggest housing boom in more than 50 years appears to be out of steam as sales tumbled in all major cities this winter and listings surged in western canada
7878779 canadas six year housing market boom is officially over aside from a few choice prairie locales sales are melting faster than this years snowpack
7878780 having said that i think its inevitable to say the housing market cannot continue to deliver the strength that weve had since 2002
7878781 theres a window of opportunity for the market to cool down and affordability to improve before the next rate tightening cycle and if that happens we shouldnt see a pullback in home prices
7878782 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7878783 do you smell that shit what the fuck smells like raw sewage
7878784 i worry that there is a segment of the population that might be harder to reach average citizens who will say come on
7878785 said mr harrison 59 a sociologist at howard university and a consultant for the joint center for political and economic studies here
7878786 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle
7878787 if obama becomes the president every remaining powerfully felt black grievance and every still deeply etched injustice will be cast out of the realm of polite discourse
7878788 our concern is that well get lost in the shuffle
7878789 people feel that theres something callous something racially indifferent in saying wait a minute weve come a long way
7878790 but whether he wins or loses for a black man to become a standard bearer for one of the two major parties it does say something
7878791 it says that the road we started down in 1965 with the voting rights act has come to an end we dont need to talk about disfranchisement in the same way anymore
7878792 a few of my white friends have asked me with barack achieving all of this will we be in a position where we can put race aside
7878793 said representative elijah e cummings democrat of maryland who is a co chairman of mr obamas campaign in that state
7878794 i hope that progressive minded people will not make a blanket conclusion that if barack has made it everybody can make it
7878795 i have never been so na ve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
7878796 hes running for president of the united states not president of the urban league
7878797 i think most people understand that he cant go out and push this overtly african american agenda

7878804 he really just was a beacon something to aspire to as a democrat

7878837 and even inhaling smoke from herbal tobacco surely cant be a good thing for a mum to be
7878838 if youre smoking herbal cigarettes all youre doing is substituting the burning leaves of one sort of plant for another people try them because they think that since they dont contain nicotine they are safer
7878839 ordinary cigarettes contain several thousand compounds but you still get tar from herbal cigarettes which could do you just as much harm
7878840 we are finished what are we going to do have a cigarette
7878841 well ive got nothing to do for the rest of the day

7878859 kitsch does not analyze culture but repackages and stylizes it appealing to mass tastes
7878860 kitsch art is pretending to express something and you in accepting it are pretending to feel
7878861 kitsch is advertising just as most advertising is kitsch it is an attempt to turn value into price the problem being that its subject matter has a value only when it is not pretended and a price only when it is hence the market in emotion must deal in simulated goods
7878862 kitsch reflects our failure not merely to value the human spirit but to perform those sacrificial acts that create it
7878863 am i prepared to let god grip me by his power and do a work in me that is worthy of himself sanctification is not my idea of what i want god to do for me sanctification is gods idea of what he wants to do for me and he has to get me into the attitude of mind and spirit where at any cost i will let him sanctify me wholly
7878864 it is often said that kitsch relies on merely repeating convention and formula lacking the sense of creativity and originality displayed in genuine art
7878865 lets keep it real we cant fool god if its not real it helps no one
7878866 if we wont engage in unpleasant upsetting things in the suffering of life if we avoid lifes complexities and confusion if we cant face pain in ourselves or others and if what we feel most deeply is always referencing ourselves sure enough we have already become deep down very shallow
7878867 just about everything that is real to you is happening inside your head
7878868 you are not the center of the world god created a massive universe even this earth is huge and rich and profound and wondrous and bigger than whats inside your head god made it
7878869 television news is designed to make you feel good about yourself for feeling bad
7878870 feelings of satisfaction about myself for feeling compassion more than it encourages any actual concern for the people who are hurt of suffering
7878871 go i wish you well keep warm and well fed
7878872 people may reject christ because they look at christians and say these people have no integrity they are more interested in being comfortable having a warm and fuzzy life they are not interested in truth in justice in the problems and agonies of the world they are interested in being comfortable
7878873 they will think they are accepting christ and they think ok this is what the christian faith is all about having warm feelings about god and jesus they will mistake sentimentality for real faith and think they are going away as christians when all they have done is tried to wrap their arms around some sort of a philosophy of warmth and na ve niceness
7878874 unspiritual and unsupportive destructive uncaring and not nice instead its confronted only by innuendos maneuvering the person into different responsibilities horizontal promotions you dont fire somebody you just push them sideways into different kinds of responsibilities never addressing their failures directly behind the scenes lots of gossip manipulation and ultimately strained relationships hard feelings and organizational chaos and dysfunction
7878875 god spoke to me and is leading me to a different place of service at this time i appreciate the opportunity to be your pastor i now must move on to wherever god leads me next
7878876 i am miserable here i cant take it any more at this point i would rather be unemployed than continue to serve here im not sure exactly where god is in all of this but in any case i know that i must move on i sure wish you would deal with the issues that have led me to this point but i wont tell you what those are so i doubt that you will actually deal with them
7878877 god spoke to me and is leading me to a different place of service at this time i appreciate the opportunity to be your pastor i now must move on to wherever god leads me next

7878893 james carville seems the least satisfied democrat in here right now
7878894 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
7878895 you havent heard about iraq you havent heard about john mccain
7878896 i mean we are a country thats borderline recession 85 80 wrong track country people health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices i mean maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now like i say we are playing hide the message pretty good
7878897 david gergen said this a short time ago that in the first two hours what is the message
7878898 and you know what david didnt get to where he was in life because hes stupid he was exactly right i look at this and i am about to jump out of my chair theres no message coming out of here there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency and weve only got four nights this is 25 of the whole thing

7878901 the telugu bidda has tasted the quality of the world if you look around every fourth or fifth family in the state has a member in the us
7878902 having a gec channel under zee telugu we decided to have a 24 hour news channel as it adds to our bouquet of channels even before that for zee the strategy was after going national and international the next destination in expansion was south and we started with zee telugu
7878903 but the telugu tv market is one of the most saturated ones
7878904 its sheer optimism that they will succeed interestingly everyone is lured by the example of tv9 which found a place for itself after etv
7878905 earlier pan india advertisers did not get their moneys worth with a bouquet of channels including regional ones they assure advertisers more bang for their buck
7878906 our vision is to plan and concentrate on niche channels we launched ntv with a clear focus on news ditto with our bhakti tv the niche devotional channel in fact im seeing a fall in viewership of gec channels and news channels are taking away the viewers from gec channels
7878907 for us this is the business of news and we are focused on andhra pradesh we do not have any other agenda if you see our news it is neutral and unbiased and we give a platform for all political parties in a fair manner thats why we have already shot into the third place in the state with our trps television rating points in just nine months of our launch
7878908 our focus is regional covering districts while our news is local we have also been focusing on local advertisers in a big way in fact we worked hard to remove the perception that tv advertising is expensive by making it affordable
7878909 what i am saying is that we have actually met the legal requirements all the time
7878910 it is self evident that employees will be exposed the more important issue is whether that exposure is harmful
7878911 we say you are in gross violation of the law we are here to show that you are in contempt of the law
7878912 theyve signed a number of new players making it difficult to say what we can expect from them but we know the coach and the tactics he favours
7878913 in the first game of the season much of the focus is our game plan
7878914 well be going in hard and our mtn 8 game against chiefs a 4 0 loss gave us an idea of areas we need to work on
7878915 thom rick was consistent for us on the right last season and his departure was a loss but weve got other players i feel confident in who can fill that gap comfortably
7878916 im building something special at united im aiming at a middle of the table finish or just maybe a top eight finish one thing for sure we wont be fighting relegation

7878918 hannes and i were climbing in the trient region of mont blanc which is on the swiss northern end of the massif
7878919 on friday morning we set off to do a route on a beautiful imposing granite spire called the petit clocher du portalet
7878920 three pitches rope lengths up hannes was in the lead when a large block of rock dislodged in his hands he fell approximately 15m
7878921 the first person i met by an absolute fluke was an alpine guide in charge of rescue services in the valley he whipped out a radio called a helicopter so i basically passed the baton
7878922 we dont climb for the risk factor we climb for the love of the mountain you do your best to stay safe and i was very comforted to hear from the rescue services that we did nothing wrong
7878923 climbing is not about being reckless or a daredevil pursuit its an expression of love for the mountains and hannes was a very safe climber
7878924 it was purely very bad luck that a piece of solid looking rock ripped off like that i was also told that his injuries were so severe that theres little chance that he would have survived even if hed received medical attention immediately
7878925 next week i am off with mark johnston to climb something big and alpine and so and so for 3 or 4 days grim life ciao h
7878926 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest mobile marketing event in the u s to date
7878927 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
7878928 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his v p pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers

7878931 ways that christians behave that look so bad to the non christian world that they cause all sorts of unbelief
7878932 sentimentality frames the world without sin and evil without brokenness ugliness confusion or cruelty these things are denied trivialized or euphemized the world is a world full of niceness warmth harmony and simplicity
7878933 the title comes from one of two errors keyes sees the modern evangelical conservative church making the temptation to adapt so much to the culture around it as to lose its own distinctive identity failing to truly salt the earth as christ commands
7878934 i think that clinton delegates are realizing that barack won the gold and hillary won the silver
7878935 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that commercial
7878936 this is a healing process i think hillarys speech will help were on schedule
7878937 theres a reason that the acceptance speech comes on the last day of the convention

7879016 come puoi tu giudicare con cotanta sapienza le mie decisioni
7879017 were planning a big one man a real big one
7879018 were trying to get all the people we know that weve played with to come and sit in and play
7879019 just think about all the people weve played with were shooting to get all of them of course people are on tour but not usually so much in march as they would be say in august
7879020 and had it not been a total emergency i wouldnt have done it this time but i just flat couldnt make it man they make you take this medication you might as well plan on staying home for half a year
7879021 i may not agree with what you say but ill defend to the death your right to say it
7879022 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
7879023 i know that i love him i know that much
7879024 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
7879025 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7879026 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7879027 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7879028 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7879029 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7879030 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7879031 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7879032 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7879033 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7879034 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7879035 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7879036 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7879037 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7879038 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet
7879039 ive been thinking overthinking that theres just too many scenarios
7879040 if anyone chooses to do gods will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own
7879041 stop judging by mere appearances and make a right judgment
7879042 and if your eye causes you to sin pluck it out
7879043 i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you i will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh
7879044 come on bill you know what hes saying is true
7879045 i have an urge to leave my wife for my secretary
7879046 i feel i need to go talk to that guy over there he sure looks awfully down
7879047 it is sinful for you to watch american idol you need to be doing more for god
7879048 i have this overwhelming urge that i need to go to the park yet there is no good reason for me to go
7879049 why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign i tell you the truth no sign will be given to it
7879050 epa traditionally has put the highest value on life of any government agency and still does despite efforts by administrations to bring uniformity to that figure among all departments
7879051 probable changes in the worlds population natural resources and environment through the end of the century
7879052 the elimination of 2 billion human beings by the year
7879053 every hot spot in the third world is in fact a result of failed population policy there is a single theme behind all of our work we must reduce population levels either governments do it our way through nice clean methods or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in iran or beirut population is a political problem once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government even fascism to reduce it to really reduce population quickly you have to put all the males into fighting and you have to kill significant numbers of fertile females
7879054 the quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in africa or through disease aids has made africa a continent that is set for extinction
7879055 we have much greater demand on our food stocks and we will make god like decisions on who lives and who does not
7879056 were going to see a rollback of the population it will happen somehow
7879057 when you are trying to dispense contraceptives and advice as aids tried to spread condoms all over the world you have to question if that is a valid program
7879058 reduction of the rate of population in these states is a matter of vital u s national security the u s economy will require large and increasing amounts of mineral from abroad especially from less developed countries that fact gives us enhanced interests in the political economic and social stability of the supplying countries wherever a lessening of population can increase the prospects for such stability population policy becomes relevant to resources supplies and to economic interests of the united states
7879059 out of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order can emerge we are now in sight of a united nations that performs as envisioned by its founders
7879060 when we are successful and we will be we have real chance at this new world order an order in which a credible united nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the uns founders
7879061 the blue helmets on the front lines of conflict on four continents are a symbol of the uns commitment to international peace and security local police must be monitored to ensure that they carry on their duties in the spirit of the new order and not the old allied with this effort will be the provision of more extensive guidance to governments on training troops and police who they may contribute to the un for peacekeeping duties abillion people live on less than one dollar a day bilateral foreign aid programs were often an instrument of the cold war and remain deeply affected by considerations of political power and national policy the centuries old doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands and was in fact never so absolute as it was conceived to be in theory
7879062 changerlain and daladier responded that the proposal had washingtons backing
7879063 malaysia has had its fill of cultural and intellectual domination

7879066 we need a hot bitch living here so that one night we can get drunk and fool around
7879067 hey i just bought a house my brother is moving in with me in a month and we have an extra room weve never lived with agirl before and we thought that it might be fun for a change so we are asking for only girls
7879068 my name is tim i am in my early age of 50s and i am an european i come
7879069 last year wasnt a great year so it wasnt too great of a thing but to be better already than we were last year is a good thing
7879070 hopefully we can keep getting points and clinch that playoff spot
7879071 we havent made the playoffs in the last three years thats the biggest thing i always try to remind them we havent won anything yet
7879072 this group is pretty good theyre pretty realistic they responded really well they played better this week than last week
7879073 its fantastic thats what we talked about from the beginning of year 37 points is huge right now i cant stress that enough
7879074 the only thing that might be unfortunate in this season is youre going to have possibly a third place team from the west or a second place team from the west get into the playoffs with a lower point total than someone that finishes fifth or sixth in the east thats going to be a bitter pill to swallow
7879075 weve had everybody together for two years the backup staff weve had for two years as well our trainer jason mathews skylar richards the assistant trainer steve tashjian and what he does with fitness its a collective effort were all on the same page its been good you always have injuries here and there you take a knock here and there but were pretty healthy that makes for a competitive situation
7879076 we should be fresh everyones willing to put the effort on the field then we have guys backing us up and helping down stretch
7879077 ive got gray hairs ill probably get more gray hairs
7879078 you always have different things happen defender danny orourke is out next week caution points so youve got to make a change there theres world cup qualifiers coming up people are going to miss some
7879079 theres plenty of playing time there the players will make the decision as far as training and sometimes the opponent will make that decision for us certainly the competition is good everybody knows theyre capable of playing and having a team with options to come in makes you better
7879080 as long as we can keep it going thats great
7879081 movies jenn wants to see but wont be able to because she cant afford a sitter
7879082 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7879083 every single advance for gay rights has come at the state level
7879084 go back and support those pro gay state legislators and eliminate the anti gay state legislators
7879085 just a little bit of money goes a long way
7879086 the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
7879087 gabita tolong mulai malam ini kita harus menganggap bahwa semua ini tak pernah terjadi oke
7879088 what are the things that evolution has at its disposal to define a creature to mix and match the parts and eventually come up with a unique organism thats going to live its life and try to reproduce
7879089 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7879090 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
7879091 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7879092 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
7879093 by 2011 mr robinov plans for dc comics to supply the material for up to two of the six to eight tent pole films he hopes warner bros will have in the pipeline by then
7879094 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own
7879095 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
7879096 were just at the cusp of being able to create the actors the heroes and the stars of the film using computer graphics as well
7879097 it captures not only the shape of your face but the way light interacts with your face from every angle
7879098 we have the ability right now to bring the emotions off of a performance that somebody just does on video
7879099 if necessary a very good animator can actually move the mouth and eyes around to give a great performance as well
7879100 they are effectively the puppeteer of one of these photo reel digital actors
7879101 this combination of technologies is just at the brink where in the next couple of years well see it really work and were all going to be pretty amazed by it
7879102 you go through the entire script with digital props and car crashes with digital robots says tracy mcsheery an engineer with phasespace a company that specialises in motion capture systems
7879103 you can show it to test audiences and vet the entire production to make sure that its exactly what you want before you spend the million of dollars and months of time and then find out it didnt quite have the look or feel that you were hoping for
7879104 theres totally the possibility that you can create something that never existed that becomes a popular star of motion picture
7879105 this has been done with mickey mouse to begin with and bugs bunny and all of these animated characters the only change now is that theyll be able to look like real people instead of cartoon characters
7879106 the best most powerful and most easily programmed computer in the world is the one between our ears
7879107 for a while yet the cheapest way to make movies will be for real people to follow the directions of the director sure cgi effects are cool and will advance a lot as the years pass but actors will be with us a long while yet
7879108 director jay russell wants the movie to be ready for the next san diego comic con weta is doing the designs and it looks amazing and whatever they need me on i help jay runs the treatment by me and i put the story together so it begins and ends with me but i dont have to write it
7879109 im a horror guy but i dont like syringes needles or scalpels
7879110 i was expecting blood and limbs everywhere so i thought i might last ten seconds
7879111 even back then i had a fascination with the macabre
7879112 very rarely cut open the chest and do open heart surgery anymore
7879113 everything was so non invasive so tidy it was like playing a video game
7879114 everyone usually riffs on boris karloff and weta is trying to move past that how does frankensteins lab look these are fun problems to have
7879115 we got a heads up at todays 9 30 meeting that most of the bolt crew has a few weeks left and then its layoff time
7879116 i survived the last four pictures without getting axed but this time ive brought in my cardboard boxes to clean out the office
7879117 bolt is the best feature ive worked on in a long time better than the last four or five features for sure
7879118 weve been hooked up for a while and now were doing this
7879119 especially with the star wars brand and indiana jones we already have more notoriety than we need if were going to give it to something we might as well give it to racing ive lived through the andretti legends and now marco is carrying that on
7879120 this place sits at the intersection of racing and wine
7879121 since i started here my ambition has been to not only be in wine country but to be active in wine making
7879122 i think its over used and i dont think its totally used correctly
7879123 i think when gifted film makers use it to help propel a story thats what its meant to be and what its there for but when just everything there is cgi you start to feel there is no soul there that theres no heart in the movie
7879124 i sat through a totally cgi movie once cant remember what the name of it was but everybody in it was cgi and i dont know man it just didnt feel right i can only go from my gut its like music you know how some music somebody else is maybe more proficient at playing the guitar but they dont have the same soul and heart and the other guy might only be able to play three chords but its still spectacular and hits you in the gut
7879125 it was so ground breaking in terms of the cgi that james used and because of all of these authority characters the terminators in the movie
7879126 im certainly getting more and more reaction from audiences that theyre getting played out on cgi
7879127 whether people can verbalise what it is about the story that doesnt feel real or not even if its on a subconscious level its kicking people out of the story we still go to the movies and we love spectacle we love monsters and all that stuff but if you get kicked out of the story and you suddenly realise that youre watching some effect then its counterproductive to what the movie experience is
7879128 with cgi you go in and you go through a lot of painstaking processes of duplicating the lighting and theres still i dont want to be misread as if im the guy saying cgi doesnt work
7879129 and then the other thing that i find that is most revealing is where there are camera moves that just defy physics i see these totally physics defying camera moves and im exhausted tired of them
7879130 sometimes in three dimensional space as defined by a computer theres no limit to what you can do
7879131 it put that movie into another mind set and i knew what i was doing
7879132 ninety percent of the stunt stuff that we did on dragon emperor
7879133 theres a billion places that the eye is so skilled at what are the tiny distortions internal reflections on a piece of sheet metal going through a certain kind of light and if you dont see those there or theyre there too perfectly you know that this is a cg car
7879134 so if the film maker is saying to you this is a real car we really jumped this river that is five hundred yards wide and you go that car is cg hes lied to you and you feel lied to but if i tell you that this is an army of skeletons laughs im not telling you that this is real im telling you that this is ray harryhausen done with todays techniques
7879135 it goes back to the history of movies there was nothing there on
7879136 i remember watching constantine and heres what his name in hell you know its gonna be fake whether its a set or computer animation or whatever it is the guys not really gonna go to hell so i accept all that
7879137 the codeword with hollywood and with all producers every time you go in you hear this they all say the word cgi they have no idea what it means or the application
7879138 i think that one of the things that happened in those early films was that because you had to rely on real life and physics and everything that what the audience saw were things that were in fact plausible
7879139 and as a result it sort of destroys the sense of reality as far as the audience watching a moment or an event its very easy to get so involved in the effect that i think as a film maker you dont stop to think that what youre really doing is taking the audience somewhere that they know is completely impossible and therefore there goes some of the fun and credibility of watching
7879140 which would make it a far different animal than the originals those movies were defined by the limitations of what was possible to do with the puppets cgi gremlins would have no limitations which is why i think theyve never been able to get a handle on a story for another one
7879141 theres more innovation now than ever as the old ways of doing things are rapidly replaced by new ones then theyre superseded etcetera
7879142 very few people understand what joe dante and his producer mike finnell went through on those
7879143 and the studio keeps wanting them to use cgi and they dont want to use cgi because they think it looks like animation and its a problem
7879144 isnt it interesting how in the hulk for example theyve made this character look so real and then i turn around and i say how come they cant make bill hurts hair piece look like its not a hair piece 140 million fucking dollars and it looks like a goddam hairpiece theyre only paying attention to the hulk and something as simple as a lace wig is sticking out there like a pimple on his nose or as my vulgar friend jimmy wood would say like a dog penis stapled to his head
7879145 he did some work for me on the film which i was extremely satisfied with
7879146 but still just a tool it isnt an end in itself

7879152 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
7879153 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
7879154 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
7879155 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player even so i didnt feel as though i was at my total best against west ham
7879156 the task of understanding the structure and properties of any material is immense and in the case of water is doubly difficult because of a the very keen interest in its properties which are actually rather amazing and complicated compared to many common liquids and b the difficulty of getting really reliable data on its properties
7879157 the significance of our results is that they will challenge the theoreticians to come up with better models for water something that has often eluded them and which even today is a subject of much study and endeavor
7879158 if that potential well is now perturbed by an approaching water molecule forming a hydrogen bond then because the proton is higher in the well it is more likely to be influenced by the approaching water molecule drawing it away from the parent oxygen more so than the deuteron which is deeper in the well and therefore less sensitive to perturbations from neighboring water molecules
7879159 there is no obvious immediate impact from understanding these structures apart from the obvious point that it will no doubt spur theoreticians to greater efforts to see if they can understand our findings
7879160 water is arguably the most important material in the human environment though there are lots of other materials we can and do study somehow water captures major interest because of its fundamental importance to us
7879161 ultimately if we understand water better we will become better at predicting its properties such as its ability to form crystals and water droplets in the atmosphere which in turn can cause immensely damaging storms as a consequence its ability to act as the medium in which life has evolved as the medium in which proteins will fold to their native structures as the material used by our industry to both heat and cool as the material used as a solvent and as a cleaner the list is rather endless

7879167 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7879168 you know about some of the things i did there for the pregnant women but yes i did sent unknowingly many women to their deaths within the day of my arrival and yes some of the things i did there some of the procedures i was forced to do there they were not honorable so you are right i have blood on my hands and believe me i can see it as clearly as you can see this tattoo here on my arm both of them will forever identify me as having to be a doctor in auschwitz not only to the world but to myself and i know this is very difficult for you to understand gentlemen not having been there but it is the truth i only did what i had to do to survive

7879170 he was someone who was after very vulnerable people and whether or not he used a weapon he could have caused a heart attack he could have caused horrible things to happen to these old ladies in the middle of the night
7879171 this was clearly a bad guy who was patient and who studied his surroundings so lapd got patient and they studied him and his surroundings

7879181 i cant think of any other reason or any other party with an interest
7879182 these are professional provocateurs and we did not want to cooperate with that on the open seas
7879183 instead of letting the entire international press obsess about this for a week the boats received almost no coverage simply because there was no confrontation
7879184 this decision was about these boats we will see what happens with any future boats
7879185 you bring one of those home in the next ten years you are dead
7879186 are we setting up barriers to the simple eye to eye contact that affirms our humanity
7879187 boy boy proved to be a very good player during the time he was training with us but the problem is we have many players playing the same position as him so the technical team decided against signing him
7879188 we have reinforced all our departments but we have still been struggling to find a quality striker
7879189 in the few weeks he has trained with us sserunkuma has proved to be very good striker and thats why we didnt hesitate to sign him
7879190 when i was 15 i used to watch match of the day and say im just as good as these players or better
7879191 i do a lot of talks with kids to get them to believe when i used to go on trials my friends used to laugh at me and say youre wasting your time but whos laughing now

7879448 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration
7879449 it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7879450 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man
7879451 its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church

7879501 air strikes on civilian targets unco ordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7879502 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7879503 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations
7879504 i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7879505 we are thankful for their help to afghanistan but that does not mean that afghan lives have no value
7879506 afghan life is not cheap and it should not be treated as such
7879507 it only feels like yesterday when i had my first press conference here
7879508 we did it at the old kanga casino and there was four old ladies sitting there crying and bagging me because they wanted wayne schwass back
7879509 i think both clubs would have been pretty happy with the way things went from there
7879510 ive never had the quickest legs and theyre slowly starting to go as well
7879511 im very relieved looking forward to finishing the year off well and hopefully tasting a lot of success in the next few weeks
7879512 ive said before take wayne carey out of the picture and this guy has won more games off his own boot than anyone else
7879513 its been a pleasure to coach shannon and watch him grow as a person hes been a big part of our footy club and probably done everything in footy apart from a win a brownlow medal that speaks volumes about his actions on the field and his work off the field
7879514 shannons done a lot of work at the calder cannons this year theres the work hes done with our academy group and his work with vic metro in the under 18s this year
7879515 theres a pretty good resume building up and its something weve already spoken about
7879516 the coaching side and development side of the game is something id love to stay involved in i have a fair bit to offer so well see where that goes at the end of the year
7879517 when you get to this stage of your career you know deep down the right time to retire and that right time has come
7879518 ive always wanted to go out on my own terms i dont think theres anything worse than going that extra year or two and end up running around in the vfl
7879519 its been a bit hectic at the start of the season i am hoping we can get something this weekend
7879520 i said i felt like i had done really well by the club and done the best i can and you like to be rewarded i would like to stay here they know that and i have a good relationship with everyone in the team and with the supporters and i would hate to leave that maybe because of something a bit minor
7879521 i have had three weeks to recuperate and am enjoying watching the boys do well and i am working really hard this week to be a part of it on friday
7879522 i am not the coach i dont make decisions i am just happy my ankles coming good i am just looking forward to being injury free at the moment
7879523 the guys have been doing a fantastic job dan and fabiano scored two and one on sunday and they had plenty of chances the week before now its just a question of me getting fit and getting back in the squad
7879524 this is my first session in three weeks and it felt quite good there was a little bit of pain out there but i am sure i will be all right for friday
7879525 it keeps us on our toes i want to win another championship and if i have to sit on the bench and bide my time and watch the boys do well then thats it but i know my qualities and everyone knows my qualities
7879526 we have got four points from two games away and thats a good start because its such a short season its exciting times for the club i have been here all this time and i feel like this is again going to be another special season
7879527 fab does a lot of similar things that danny does if i could come in and work off them and use my speed it could be something exciting i just hope i pull up right for friday
7879528 we knew that it would always be coming down to the last game of the group stage i was disappointed to get an injury against argentina because i felt like i was starting to get a bit of my fitness back but i am grateful arnie coach graham arnold gave me the opportunity to be an olympian
7879529 it obviously was disappointing but i thought the guys did really well in that last game
7879530 were obviously very disappointed that an arrangement couldnt be reached which would have seen 2006 melbourne cup winner delta blues and runner up pop rock return to melbourne for the spring racing carnival
7879531 biosecurity australia confirmed that the only option currently available is for horses from japan to be imported via an approved third country such as hong kong or singapore but given the quarantine periods required in each location this is unacceptable to the connections of the japanese horses
7879532 steve has been working towards this for four years and to have the rewards for him and the relief for us is just fabulous
7879533 i just felt so happy when i was flying in and seeing melbourne all around
7879534 im looking forward to feeling winter again ive been in some stifling conditions over the past couple of weeks itll be good to just chill out and sit back and watch the footy again
7879535 absolutely theres hope you never rule anything out and the biggest thing for me is getting my back right consider my options seriously and facing a few brutal facts you have to get the right motivation for it
7879536 attitudes have changed greatly since my time modesty seems to have disappeared
7879537 when don got his duck in his last test i think i heard someone say jolly well bowled eric what would have happened today if hed got out the greatest batsman theyd have probably chased him all over the ground and kissed him and hugged him
7879538 i put my little hand out and i said how do you do mr bradman
7879539 he was very conscious of being a role model not only for cricket for sport particularly through the depression he was a hero to everybody he was always extraordinarily aware of his responsibility and always endeavoured to do the right thing
7879540 he never grasped the interest in him and he found it very difficult to understand that he was remembered for so long after he finished playing cricket
7879541 he didnt like celebrations and he didnt like fuss and i think if he had known what was going to happen on his centenary he would have been quite grateful he got out in the 90s
7879542 he didnt want to be remembered for his cricketing achievements he wanted to be remembered for his integrity
7879543 he lived a life where he had a job from which he earned his income and he played cricket which he loved but there was really no connection between them
7879544 we have set up an export team to focus on the markets of latin america and the middle east we are planning to begin exports to latin america from next year
7879545 let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7879546 18 million people voted for me eighteen million people give or take voted for barrack
7879547 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7879548 my vote is a protest vote i live in ohio i know our votes count in a very special way because whoever wins ohio is often the person who becomes the president of the united states and i do not want to reward the democratic party with my vote i am disgusted with them
7879549 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come onboard
7879550 thats not surprising but if you take a look i think at this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7879551 he ran a good campaign here jesse jackson ran a good campaign too
7879552 for any innuendo to suggest that clinton was raising the race card still angers him and justifiably so
7879553 ive always described the conversation as being less than pleasant
7879554 congressman clyburn who before the south carolina primary warned president clinton about getting too close to the line owes him an apology everybody who criticized sen clinton not barack obama after she made her remark about mlk and lbj especially leaders of the black community who i heard criticize her owe her an apology
7879555 the reason she may be a front runner is her husband messed around
7879556 was it fair to imply that hillarys whole career depended on being a victim of an unfaithful husband no
7879557 and thats what it sounded like i was saying and it hurt people who id like to think normally like what i say in fact like me
7879558 youre nominated to be president its your campaign at some point quit talking about the clintons and move on
7879559 you must be the change you wish to see in the world

7879577 its like taking an ice cube and covering it with a layer of sand the sand is going to keep the underlying ice cold a bit longer
7879578 there is still a lot of snow and ice accumulating and therefore a very high likelihood of melting and water flow to form gullies
7879579 we think that dry avalanches are unlikely to be the major factor because we see such obvious evidence of the presence of ice and snow even today
7879580 the groundwater release seems unlikely because groundwater would be at greater depths and if you had enough melting to get down to such depths you would have to start with the near surface snow and ice

7879602 my furniture my photos my christmas ornaments where will i go
7879603 we started the study in 1979 and recruited women who were pregnant or living in areas of cincinnati that have high incidents of lead poisoning such as over the rhine the west end avondale and some parts of price hill
7879604 ive been involved with these kids for three decades and they ask me why cant i hold onto a job
7879605 the argument is over its important for society as a whole to clearly put lead on the table as the culprit for problem children in the inner city who have low academic achievement
7879606 rapists everywhere it is a growing phenomenon the child rape growing
7879607 every street contains one a cyber pervert a sex man an abduction performer waiting behind car windscreens or upvc window panelling to pounce and snatch and perform entries into the innocence of youth
7879608 they do their rapes in the day or the night
7879609 perhaps the most terrifying thing about their sex it follows no temporal routine
7879610 our constant vigilance is the modern necessity putting a stop to the strangers
7879611 everyones a suspect why is he smiling why is he frowning does he live here yes no who are these people everyone
7879612 when we were in youth the world was a safe place television has come at the price of infant buggery
7879613 childhood has never been less safe than now the gentle games of our children must be punctuated repeatedly by warnings murder knifes electrical flex towels wrapped heavily around the throat and mouth inhibiting breathing sexual prowlers and endless string of physical violations they must be aware dammit aware of these horrors
7879614 scared to open their doors scared to leave their houses
7879615 i am so very scared every day i have these terrible feelings of of scared
7879616 scared for the children if they cross the road they will die abducted knifed tortured over the telephone broadcast on the internet the screaming children oh god
7879617 not just the men taylor the women too the unmentionable vaginal acts of the women
7879618 be strong taylor we must confront these atrocities ourselves if our children are to remain safe
7879619 to society the rapes grow exponentially it has become the norm
7879620 the streets are certain death for our children my heavens what can we do
7879621 we must microchip them its the only thing to do the only safe thing
7879622 may the good conservative lord save us from crimes of a coital persuasion
7879623 i can feel your pain in me like the spirit itself
7879624 i know i thought getting little jessie out of school would reassure my enormous concerns about her public safety but the more i read those newspapers the less sure i am about anything
7879625 times have changed no one is safe not even us and not even in the sanctity of these four walls
7879626 anything anything we must do anything for the sake of the living future
7879627 and we know that any madman could threaten their safety inside
7879628 yes yes any madman i dream nightmares of disguised paedophiles dressed in uniforms and carrying the required identification documents to present themselves as professionals in the employ of the utility companies and knocking door to door to conduct a meter reading for the purposes of accurate billing
7879629 before i know it they are in the house and conducting unmentionable acts of hideousness onto the genitals and bodies of our helpless children curse these nightmares and the reflection of reality they represent
7879630 this is representative of my fullest concerns to wit the house itself whilst apparently of safety may in fact become more prison than sanctuary
7879631 what if even our home can so easily fall prey to the horrors of the sex pervert what hope do our children have
7879632 one must never under any circumstance save personal entrance and exit of the abode open the front door ever
7879633 certainly yes i shout commands from the top bathroom window to anyone who ventures onto the driveway
7879634 but what else youve seen the news theyre everywhere they could they could see through the windows see our children at play and use it to fuel some kind of masturbatory development there is nothing sacred to these men and women
7879635 for which reason we must ensure that a permanent closure of curtains is operative within the homestead
7879636 i know you are and so am i the world is a cruel place for children and adults alike and it is the responsibility of the decent parent to hide and shelter them from that world and that is exactly what we shall do for jessie and little christopher the world has gone i think its safer that way
7879637 you know love and safety are very much two integral halves of the same whole
7879638 im a dad and i take that responsibility very seriously and i know you feel the same about being a mum
7879639 and i think as a dad that the best way the only way i can really know that i am being the best most responsible dad i can be is if i
7879640 i need to we need to or rather we have to fully engulf the children physically be all over them inside them outside them we need to be one with them
7879641 i knew youd know it was the safest thing to do
7879642 its so beautiful so safe remember love and safety are two sides of the same reassuring coin
7879643 but we want to protect our children from the sexual violations of the perverts
7879644 of course we do and thats what were doing here think about it
7879645 if were making love to our children it means that someone else some stranger someone we dont know or trust isnt do you understand
7879646 in fact its the most sensible thing we can hope for in this awful modernity and because we love our children so much and because we are not dangerous or harmful individuals we are the only two people who should be making love to them as no one else can ever love them as much as we do
7879647 and perhaps most true of all it is only by crossing this final bridge of spatial closeness that we can know with the utmost certainty that we are truly protecting our children it will make us closer than anything and we will sleep well at last knowing that we are keeping them safe from all the evil people the modern world produces total physical protection our bodies will join as one familial bodily unit shielded by intimacy and by proximity
7879648 you are the kindest most sensitive man you understand the danger intuitively the children are lucky to have a father like you
7879649 but mummy you didnt even know her she wasnt your little girl
7879650 the microchips children children the microchips oh thank you father for this the next level of responsible parent child safety interaction
7879651 another nail of reassurance in the coffin of familial security
7879652 this way we will always know where you are isnt that terrific
7879653 we do everything for you youre our children our lives everything we have as adults we know that the world is not safe for you were all better off in here together
7879654 away from the paedophiles and the fiends of a publicised contemporary deviant sexuality
7879655 away from the perverts just us together one big happy family i mean what could the world possibly have to offer us
7879656 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7879657 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
7879658 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatazoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
7879659 life begins at conception is a core issue of faith
7879660 this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7879661 shouldnt have an impact on a the womans right to choose
