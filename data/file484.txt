4840232 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4840238 rpos are being pushed by txdot in an attempt to make the public believe that they are the same as the 391 sub regional planning commissions
4840239 i dont believe he saenz exactly told the truth a minute ago chairman delisi she wanted to make this a love fest today and she committed to honesty but they have already broken that honesty when it was brought up about the rpos earlier today we had a person at that meeting on rpos who sent me an email of what went on at that meeting on july 10 saenz addressed this and said they had come up with money at txdot to help fund and reimburse the cogs if they created an rpo
4840240 whats important is that txdot has promulgated regulations to create rpos which legislation actually failed last session so txdot decided to push the rpo issue forward so when the legislature comes into session they are to authorize by statute what they have done by regulation then they will pull the cog rpos into the transportation statute and totally control all of the rpos theyll be nothing but a sounding board instead of a real board
4840241 what mr gilbert just presented is not factual first of all for the commissions we have not adopted or done anything with the rpos this was a conference there is a mechanism in there that if they would be formed which is one of the recommendations then we can use state planning funds from the federal side to be able to cover their planning needs but we have not taken any action on anything like that

4840248 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
4840249 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
4840250 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally
4840251 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone

4840378 i spoke to coach wannstedt and he was happy i committed i talked to all the rest of the coaches too
4840379 i just built a relationship with them and i trust them i felt as though that could be my family
4840380 no thats going to be just about my last visit i want to stick with this im going to take an official visit to pitt but that will be my only other visit

4840387 despite the rhetoric from those opposed to our alliance this is a competitive contested market all we want now is a level playing field with the other airline alliances that have already been given the go ahead
4840388 we want to be in a position where we are indifferent to which airline is operating the flight
4840389 just because this might be bad for richard branson doesnt mean it is bad for british consumers or the british economy in fact it is good for consumers and the economy
4840390 ba and american would have a combination of a trans atlantic network that could not be replicated and a frequentflyer programme that would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers the alliance partners will be able to use their leverage on routes where there is little or no competition to tie in consumers on routes where there are plenty of other alternatives this would inevitably lead to a reduction of choice and higher prices for consumers
4840391 there is no logic to our having to pay any price in terms of slots

4840439 after the athens games i didnt think about participating in the especially during the last two years
4840440 i wasnt doing very well and i was kind of confused i didnt know what to do but then i persevered i tried very hard i did a lot of training so this gold didnt come very easy
4840441 i did a lot and paid a lot for this gold
4840442 im 33 years old and i made it to the final in this beijing games i believe it was tenacity that got me this gold medal
4840443 since i didnt get the gold medal im still a bit upset and i just hope that tomorrow lin dan will be able to beat lee chong wei
4840444 im not thinking about london where the next olympics take place in 2012 now its hard to imagine if i will participate

4840446 the uplifting saga of a man who escaped genocidal cambodia became a u s citizen then served in the bush i and ii administrations moving and frequently educational
4840447 the story is always compelling and siv moves the narrative forward by raw force of will
4840448 you cant honestly expect to run somebody elses pack it has to be your own you have to see it as your own or else youll lose it jimmy instead of wanting to run fens pack you should want to make your own you and i were just like the wolves in the wild striking out for territory of our own and starting over from scratch well do it our way well choose our pack mates and well learn from the pack we lost and do it right
4840449 you know i always loved the idea of hunting in a pack
4840450 okay enough jimmy just fucking tell me whats going on you know more about werewolves than any man alive on the planet
4840451 you just said that as though youd been there and youve been involved in a lot of weird shit since you got here
4840452 i guess i can understand that i cant even imagine what that must have been like for you
4840453 think how it would feel to have your arms and legs ripped off
4840454 the classrooms we shared the halls we walked down together every second in this place is like a fucking cheese grater carving out pieces of my soul
4840455 ive had a lot of coaches over the years both good and bad
4840456 bo i dont know who i am anymore i feel like ive lost more than i should be able to survive but my heart is still beating my lungs are still breathing but im not really alive
4840457 youre jimmy walker a good man whos just had a truck load of shit dumped on him that would be more than enough to crush a man twice your age i just realized that coach metaphor i just used a good coach is sort of like the alpha in a wolf pack youve got that in you youd make a great alpha wolf and i know youll find yourself again soon this sort of thing is called the dark night of the soul and like any other night it too falls away eventually to the rising sun of a new day and ill say it again if you were my coach my alpha id follow you
4840458 yeah just how the hell did i manage to forget my own birthday
4840459 i thought it was a little weird that you didnt say a thing about it earlier but oh well come on my ditzy love
4840460 here this ones from me i really hope you like it
4840461 i hope thats a good one i didnt really know what you would like so thats what the guy at guitar center recommended
4840462 honey youre babbling i love it this is freakin awesome look i can even plug it into the computer to record myself thanks sweetie i cant wait to use it
4840463 well your birthdays not quite done yet i seem to have missed one john said handing it to me and then he took moms hand and rubbed the back of it with his thumb
4840464 what did you think i would give up so easily i never stopped looking for him and through a fortuitous twist of fate i finally found him lokis uncle works for a collections agency in montana and just happened to find an old file on him at his work
4840465 i hope you dont have any plans for the next week because ive already arranged things at school so you can go visit him if you want
4840466 have you talked with him is he okay with me coming up to see him
4840467 john and i have been discussing it with him for a while now
4840468 loki was our accomplice helping keep you occupied while your dad and i did all the work arranging
4840469 it wasnt very hard either youve been so preoccupied lately
4840470 come outside with me jimmy i want to talk to you a minute
4840471 absolutely i mean hes the father ive dreamt of hoped of meeting ever since i was old enough to understand
4840472 did you think wed just drop that in your lap and expect you to do it all on your own
4840473 oh and you might want to check the glove box
4840474 in the beginning we gathered the children to lessen their trauma from the earthquake then we got an idea to give free batik classes for those children so with this class we could preserve batik tradition and ease the childrens trauma from earthquake
4840475 i would like to see my batik creation displayed on the exhibition and make money out of it
4840476 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
4840477 we are all very saddened by this we received 13 casualties out of whom six are being operated upon we have given emergency treatment to the rest but two of them are in a serious condition they will have to be operated on
4840478 i was coming with my wife on a motorcycle and i said to her i think a transformer has burst she said its a bomb blast something has hit my back when i got down to look i saw that my child was injured his arm was broken i brought him and my wife to the hospital where there was mayhem all around
4840479 i mean its great it really is rewarding to work with the eagles but theres something more going on here to work these days in conservation focusing on just one species in a vacuum does not make all that much sense because it is the ecosystems as a whole that are in danger
4840480 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4840481 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4840482 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4840483 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4840484 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4840485 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4840486 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4840492 spied on american citizens without a court ordered warrant in violation of the law and the fourth amendment directed telecommunications companies to create an illegal and unconstitutional database of the private telephone numbers and emails of american citizens and tampered with free and fair elections
4840493 when i was younger i was fortunate with my competitors i learnt that you have to look after yourself on the racecourse fight for every position and give no quarter
4840494 even at the age of 10 racing optimists around the carrick roads down in falmouth it was a full on battle
4840495 jacques villeneuve said that the biggest thing about fitness was his ability still to be able to think under the pressures of heat and cornering whatever
4840496 its the same with sailing sailing is an incredibly complex sport with so many things going on at once youre constantly analysing the speed of your boat the conditions and your competitors when youre working the boat hard your heart rates high and youre tired the fitter you are though the more able you are to make the right tactical decisions
4840497 sailing on my own if something goes wrong theres nowhere else to put the blame you have to be very honest to identify it put it right and move forward
4840498 a lot of people in sailing talk about their performance and from what ive seen theyre kidding themselves they fall by the wayside by not training hard enough or being properly prepared preparation is everything to me if i went into an event short of preparation i would find it hard to be settled fortunately i go into events happy ive done everything i need to do i dont want to compete unless im going to win im not saying ill win all the time but thats my job im there to win im not interested in coming second
4840499 in competition i go onto a regime of very light training just to keep the body loose with stretching and injury prevention exercises all the hard work goes into the build up to events a lot of it to do with putting on muscle mass or losing a bit of weight
4840500 i fluctuate my weight according to conditions some venues are more windy than others putting on muscle for windy conditions is critical in strong winds it becomes very physical with a lot of rapid pumping of the sail to make the boat go faster your heart rate shoots up maxing out at around 190 for about five or 10 minutes
4840501 when i was younger i put too much pressure on myself because i hadnt yet got the gold id given up on going to university to have a crack at a professional sailing career and if i didnt get those results i was screwed
4840502 ive never led a normal life in the past 10 years i havent spent more than two weeks continuously at home in the uk im a nomad which is hard on family relationships and friends but im incredibly fortunate because i do what i love doing more than anything else in the world you get an amazing sense of achievement to get up on the podium now i dont feel like i have to go out there and race for anybody else im doing it for myself
4840503 if im trying to put on weight i get up at six and have a protein shake
4840504 if not ill wait for breakfast at 7 30 and have an omelette wholemeal toast and skimmed milk
4840505 i get by on powerbars for protein or energy supplemented by rehydration drinks coming off the water ill grab a sandwich or a bowl of pasta
4840506 dinner is chicken or steak with rice or potatoes and a salad or some vegetables and sometimes ill have a beer to relax
4840507 i wanted to do a relatable grounded character comedy about marriage and the lengths we go to preserve the spark
4840508 tina and steve are smart and relatable and the tone of their comedy perfectly fits this film

4840510 and guess what this member would be all about this member would be all about socializing er uh pauses for several moments would be about pause basically taking over and the government running all of your companies
4840511 the current estimates of the crisis are far from impartial one does not have to look far for examples that illustrate this the hague based international tribunal for former yugoslavia was set up to investigate war crimes on the territory of former yugoslavia it is not necessary to speak of its bias for it is openly anti serbian in nature most trials have been against serbs and serbs are condemned as a rule acquittals are handed out to croats bosnian muslims or kosovar albanians when yugoslavia turned to the international tribunal with a request to investigate natos aggression in 1999 the request was rejected judging by this experience i greatly doubt that the tribunal can come up with an unbiased and objective analysis on what happened in the former yugoslavia and on what is happening now in the caucasus
4840512 georgias crimes against south ossetia should be considered by an international criminal court i doubt that the international community will demonstrate an unbiased and objective attitude to the developments in the caucasus impartiality is crucial in estimating the horrible events of late but i sadly note that the western news media started to cover the developments in the caucasus 24 hours after georgian troops entered south ossetia western media began to comment on the situation only after russian peace keepers entered south ossetia correspondents in the west were silent when georgian tanks levelled ossetian villages how can one expect objectivity on the developments in the caucasus in the west one can see that the western media is distorting the facts
4840513 the fact that these organs may be solely procured for money at least hospital driven that the hospital has driven it solely for money is abhorrent its a crime
4840514 im incredibly inspired by what hes doing im understanding that is paying for this trip out of his own pocket and that hes received death threats that hes still going about it out because of his conscience and wanting to share this information is truly inspiring and just a fantastic role model to all of us
4840515 were doing this out of a sense of commitment i mean once we wrote the report and came to the conclusion that these human rights violations were occurring were both human rights activists and felt that we really had to do something to end the abuse and the reality is nobody much else is doing that so it really fell to us to work on this

4840540 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
4840541 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
4840542 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
4840543 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
4840544 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
4840545 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

4840565 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4840659 we dont want a negative dynamic in natos relations with russia we want it to be positive but for that to happen russia has to pull back from georgia respect georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity and play by 21st century rules
4840660 georgia is going to emerge from this and it will be rebuilt it will resume its place as one of the leading economies
4840661 and so what the russians will have achieved is that they will have demonstrated that they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4840662 and i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4840676 from the neuropathology standpoint it either is or it isnt its really no different looking at glass slides associated with her brain exam than it is an alzheimers patient somebody who has dementia somebody who is in a persistent vegetative state there is really very little fudging in pathology there is either damage here or there is not damage here in this particular part of her brain it really was not a difficult call in making the diagnosis
4840677 predominantly involved the border zone watershed areas and were most severe in the occipital lobes with relative preservation of the frontal and temporal lobes

4840815 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4840816 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4840817 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4840818 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4840819 lets resolve at the outset to keep an open mind and follow the facts wherever they take us

4840837 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4840838 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4840839 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4840840 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4840841 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4840842 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4840843 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4840844 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4840845 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4840846 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4840847 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4840848 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4840849 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4840850 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4840851 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4840852 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4840853 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4840854 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4840855 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4840856 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4840857 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4840858 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4840859 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4840860 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4840861 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4840862 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4840863 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4840864 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4840865 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4840866 you will know who my vp when i say it
4840867 wes clark is going to speak as the vp nominee but please keep that secret until obama announces his choice thank you
4840868 there has been very little contact between the clark office and the obama campaign since clarks comments about mccains lack of command experience on a tv show that the obama campaign asked clark to appear in at the last minutes
4840869 cathiefromcanada the obama team did not tell obama not to go to the convention they told him he would have no role at the convention his team appropriately interpreted this to mean that they were not wanted and fundamentally there is no reason to go the convention
4840870 all i wanted was to be wanted thats all i wanted

4840872 i made a commitment to temple that i was going to make it and make it right
4840873 i never pushed to get it made until now because now we got it right
4840874 pacifist what is pacifism if you came home and someone had a loaded gun to your kids head would you say that you knew that he was from a bad upbringing and understood his anger no sometimes the best way to say i love you is with a bullet to the head
4840875 after all being rich and famous is great but being famous doesnt necessarily get you the best seat at the finest restaurant
4840876 it broke skin this time and i want it out of here now
4840877 if you came home and someone had a loaded gun to your kids head would you say that you knew that he was from a bad upbringing and understood his anger no sometimes the best way to say i love you is with a bullet to the head
4840878 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4840879 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4840880 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4840881 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4840882 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4840883 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4840884 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4840885 who are open to doing something on the production side
4840886 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4840887 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4840888 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4840889 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4840890 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4840891 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4840892 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4840893 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4840894 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4840895 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4840896 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4840897 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4840898 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4840899 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4840900 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4840901 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4840902 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4840903 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4840904 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4840905 the golden age when commodity prices could only go up is gone
4840906 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4840907 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4840908 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4840909 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4840910 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4840911 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4840912 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4840913 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4840914 we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4840915 do any one of you think your candidate is perfect i think there is plenty of emotion on both sides
4840916 has anyone anywhere ever heard anybody but a republican call obama the messiah
4840917 just returned from europe where many people i spoke to asked why he was in europe acting as president
4840918 there have been pieces in the msm about the serious concerns that much of the money raised abroad is not from americans
4840919 obama will lose because he raises twice as much in campaign contributions as mcsame
4840920 obama will lose because he is the same as bush
4840921 it is dangerous to bet our nation on an politically inexperienced plagarist plagiarist
4840922 if you are so concerned about senator obamas knowledge of geography you should know that he graduated from columbia university with a major in international studies and that his i q was verified twice in school at over 165 he has actually lived in a foreign country and is very knowledgeable about political geography
4840923 obama had a chance to do something about it and chose self interest over the best interests of this country
4840924 the best interest of the country the gop bought and stole the last election by their smear tactics and by their voter caging plan dreamed up by karl rove in which they spent millions to disenfranchise democratic votes its all documented at www gregpalast com
4840925 you know what lou about your war hero mr mccain the only qualification to become a pow is a willingness to surrender between that and the lincoln savings and loan job he did id say you are backing a criminal surrender monkey who cannot possibly expect to live to see the effects of his surrenduring felonious type of behavior as surrendurer in chief
4840926 you and me have something in common lou we expect to live more than 4 years you might want to think who is vested more 4 years out if not lou i challenge you to a bet of 1 000 000 that mccain will unilaterally start a war with first a teeni weeni country and then a bigger one that he ends up surrenduring to because in his advancing dementia he thought we had 8 million troops in checkoslovakia or siam whatdaya say
4840927 throw the republicans the hell oout the republicans record is criminal fact
4840928 the fact that obama is so charismatic and can charm americans into believing his nonsence is ridiculous at this point i am pretty much ashamed to be an american
4840929 cynically hijacking the faith based initiatives idea for electoral gain
4840930 tudo que eu posso dizer que ser uma nova aventura para todos n s
4840931 conhe o rick j faz 20 anos e espero por essa oportunidade desde ent o ainda n o sentamos para acertar as id ias mas tenho um timo pressentimento quanto ao que vai surgir disso
4840932 i came to a point where i was willing to die
4840933 i just took my shoes off and my shirt off and jumped in
4840934 i just happened to come up and there was mr johnson
4840935 i saw him diving in my next breath i looked up and saw him touching my kayak i said i cant die and ruin his day i was worried about him then dakota showed up i think theyre two heroes i couldnt believe how fast everything was happening
4840936 they were soaking wet and they were out of breath because theyre both out of shape as young as they are
4840937 they did a selfless act and they did it without hesitation you cant tell them no no no and not reward them for the positive things
4840938 it feels really good doing something good to help someone

4840941 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4840942 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4840943 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4840944 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4840945 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4840946 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4840947 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4840948 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4840949 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4840950 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4840951 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4840952 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4840953 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4840954 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4840955 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4840956 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4840957 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4840958 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4840959 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4840960 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4840961 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4840970 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4840973 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4840974 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4840975 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4840976 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4840977 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4840978 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4840979 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4840980 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4840981 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4840982 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4840983 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4840984 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4840987 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington
4840988 the strong fundraising numbers are a testament to barack obama s message of change and hope and his vision for americas future

4840994 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4840995 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4841004 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4841005 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4841006 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4841007 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4841008 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4841009 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4841010 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4841011 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4841012 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4841013 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4841014 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4841015 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4841016 a part of me had died but another part was born
4841017 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4841018 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4841019 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4841020 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4841026 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4841027 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4841028 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4841029 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4841030 sometimes i look out my office windows and i can almost see the ghosts of the workers and buildings that were here for so many years
4841031 its often hard to believe that weve come this far
4841032 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4841033 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4841034 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4841035 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4841036 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4841037 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4841038 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4841039 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4841040 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country

4841050 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4841051 oh yeah thats cause they had to completely rebuild the town after the war youll see the beach it really broad and flat so the germans though that when the allies would invade they might do it here so to keep the germans thinking that the british bombed the town to the ground the raf tried to make a memorial here for all the pilots that were killed and the town would let them theyre not big fans of the british here since they reduced the town rubble
4841052 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4841053 your strategy is probably a little easier because of the way the game plays out when youre at home youre also more familiar with the mound and the way the ball plays off the wall
4841054 the game is based by the guy on the mound
4841055 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4841056 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4841057 people talk about experience but its only one part of the evaluation process
4841058 i dont think experience is the magic pill that guarantees success there are a lot of things to look at
4841059 the guys at the top of the lineup have to be on base and work the count
4841060 erick is starting to develop into that type of hitter at this point in his career hes come a long way
4841061 i havent felt good all year just kind of in and out
4841062 yesterday van burkleo said a couple of things that made sense to me and i just kind of took that into the game and it felt good everything is a feeling and my swing felt good i got good pitches to hit so it was a combination of all that
4841063 van burkleo has been telling me for a week now that hes coming and hes feeling good
4841064 that is a real positive sign and he showed it
4841065 he was my hitting coach in double a so we have a good relationship
4841066 they could wear big league uniforms and these high school kids for three days could get a taste of what life is like in the big leagues
4841067 you get a competitive feeling unlike some of the showcases where guys just go in and pitch their two innings or get their four at bats and no one keeps score
4841068 this has that competitive feel to it where the giants want to get their name on the cup and the northwest team wants to keep it in the northwest so you get guys stealing bases bunting hitting and running
4841069 its a good time for scouts to get a head start on the 2009 draft and we just try to put guys in that are entering their senior year so theyll be eligible for next years draft
4841070 the best feeling i get is when i escort the kids onto the field for the first time and seeing their eyes and watching the parents sit in the stands and seeing their kid wear a mariners or a san francisco giants uniform and they look like big leaguers
4841071 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4841072 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4841073 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4841074 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4841075 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4841076 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4841077 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4841078 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4841079 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4841080 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4841081 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4841082 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4841083 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4841084 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4841085 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4841086 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4841087 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4841088 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4841089 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4841090 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4841091 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4841092 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4841093 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4841094 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4841095 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4841096 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4841097 weve been running on a deficit for years its costing us four times the amount we receive from the government four fifths of the budget is for animal control which is a government function
4841098 if we dont improve our situation we will be forced to stop we cant keep operating with this kind of deficit
4841099 we think we can solve the problem on st croix
4841100 we are really making this effort because since the anti cruelty law has passed not one case has been successfully prosecuted

4841102 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids
4841103 aids epidemic is not over in america especially not in black america
4841104 2006 cdc data tell us that about half of the just over 1 million americans living with hiv or aids are black
4841105 five percent of the entire population in dc is infected thats comparable to countries like uganda or south africa
4841106 aids epidemic in the u s is not getting the kind attention that it merits
4841107 we understand the needs of black folk in johannesburg south africa
4841108 why cant we understand the needs of them in jackson mississippi we understand the needs in nigeria or botswana why not understand the needs of los angeles or oakland
4841109 increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic remained all but flat

4841126 this is a major accomplishment for the territory as it marks the first time since the inception of the specific performance measure that the territory has achieved compliance
4841127 the piling work is expected to disrupt traffic flow and power supply in lower road town

4841170 i rushed far and wide about italy i took 20 000 photographs i wore out one car and two cameras i barely missed crashing in a private plane and was almost trampled by fans during a football game
4841171 your photos speak about an italy of real people of humble artisans of habitual devotion of simple pleasures of family feelings tourist landscapes of monuments so famous that now they have become almost invisible
4841172 your images do not want to interpret an italian reality but only go to recuperate it and it is this faithfulness underlying the photographs of your unpretentious provincial and humble italy which you show us in filigree you always show respect without awe without being overwhelmed you show love without infatuation
4841173 henri cartier bresson for instance can do his work in complete peace capturing the most authentic moments having avoided personal publicity he can move freely and look on from the sidelines unnoticed as an actress however every public appearance inevitably attracts not only a small crowd of paparazzi hunting the people who make the news but a swarm of fans as well who ask for autographs or are simply contended with a close look at a face theyve so often seen on the screen

4841188 i wasnt doing very well and i was kind of confused i didnt know what to do but then i persevered i tried very hard i did a lot of training so this gold didnt come very easy

4841210 i thought i played better than level par but missed everything in the 15 foot range and you need to make a few of those to shoot a good score the wind was in the opposite direction though and it took a little bit of adapting to

4841240 theres a mutual understanding between us at all times i have the highest word of praise for them they look out for me when they see im tired they suggest i take a rest and theyll come back and check on me
4841241 but that would have been a big mistake i dont know what i was thinking about
4841242 this experience shows me that at the world stage theres nothing better
4841243 experience wise im going to learn more in the three weeks im here that i will learn in no matter how many iaaf courses i take over the next three years
4841244 ive learned a lot and ive seen eric in particular grow over the last week that he has been here on a mental level tahesia will always be tahesia she stays focused shes relaxed so she just has to go out and see who she stands up on the weekend
4841245 but its something that has to be done so i have to deal with it

4841247 if you visit the great wall you are a great man
4841248 the bvi was our toughest competition in the tournament so far
4841249 they have a lot of size and athletic guards and early on that caused a lot of dumb turnovers on our part
4841250 the bahamas has good size so we gave them different looks on defense
4841251 i had a pretty good swim but i tried a little bit too hard in the end and switched my stroke up a little bit
4841252 but you just have to go with the flow and ride it out unfortunately i didnt ride it out so well but my start was great my start is always the strongest part of my swimming and my first 25 meters i just have to be confident in riding i out to the end now to take me to the next level
4841253 this olympics i was more confident more relaxed and i enjoyed it more than i did last time and i swam faster than i did in the last olympics
4841254 he has been getting stronger upper body wise and he has been swimming the race stronger from his legs which made him faster than four years ago
4841255 i saw that for the first 35 meters of the 50 and then because he was excited he tried to do more and got into the wall quicker by doing too much so his stroke got shorter and flatter and thats not joshs strong point
4841256 it was a very very good fight and i worked very hard
4841257 i didnt get any points and i did not know the score until i was walking to the dressing room after interviews i was like what zero it happened but you cant win them all however i feel ive accomplished a lot thus far because even people that were set to medal didnt make it past the first round and i went to the second round and i thank god everything was good
4841258 i guess he saw how i fought and switched up his hands were fast
4841259 he punched boom got the point then moved he wasnt throwing the combinations and thats what i expected him to do go off and he didnt do it he used his head hes a really good fighter
4841260 in this match we thought he would have been the same way but he changed his boxing style completely
4841261 his hands never dropped past his waist they were up the whole night he did a lot of moving his whole style changed honestly i gave him the edge in the match we were scoring and they did not give us one point in the whole match i saw that he might have beaten us by one or two points but not 10 nothing
4841262 our guys are just 19 and 21 and if we had that kind of seasoning under our belts we would have done a lot more
4841263 we felt that experience had a lot to do with the outcome of the bout but still i felt that we were underscored and they did not give us the points that we got
4841264 when i looked at the screen in the first round i knew we were going to get at least two points and when i looked i saw one point for the red corner which was us but when i looked again it was the blue corner and i was really amazed because i know the guy didnt even touch john in the first round thats the way it goes sometimes but his is not the end of it

4841311 through examples like susan smith we are able to peer into the white womans imagination and begin to see that not only does she still have black male fantasies but too study her fantasies have evolved while before the current ultraviolet light surge in the slave era their fantasies were just for our sexuality the new white mind wants and imagines more they want black males to kill their children they want black males assault kidnap and rob them they receive sexual gratification from thoughts of black males raping amp killing them

4841416 os sal rios deixaram de ser fator dinamizador da economia para serem mero custo de produ o pois a abertura da economia nos levou a competir com pa ses nos quais se pagava sal rios mais baixos

4841424 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4841425 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4841449 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4841450 no im not horrible but yes i am a lesbian and i have the sweetest most amazing girlfriend ever and i couldnt be happier
4841451 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4841452 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4841453 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4841454 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4841455 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4841456 som dere vet har jeg f tt greie p hvor jeg skal havne til slutt og jeg arbeider m lrettet og utrettelig for at flest mulig skal f lge meg dit husk jeg er denne verdens fyrste og har evnen til styre menneskers f lelser og lyster dette bruker jeg aktivt
4841457 ja men vi har jo en mektig kirke drevet av en mektig stat og den er vel et problem
4841458 statskirke ordningen er en genial ordning for f avviklet kirke og kristenliv jeg har et utmerket samarbeid med et forbund som reklamerer med humanisme og etikk men de har helt andre spilleregler n r de jobber for meg for bli kvitt kristendommen mine n kkelpersoner har jeg plassert i strategisk viktige posisjoner i det politiske system og vi g r for en gradvis avkristning s langsom at de f rreste reagerer p det som skjer forbud og forf lgelser har vi fors kt andre steder f eks i kina og det virker mot min hensikt
4841459 hva kan vi gj re for at det skal g litt fortere
4841460 det er viktig at kirkens ansatte f lger mine n kkelpersoners anvisning om hva de skal si og l re de f som fremdeles g r i kirken
4841461 men folk kan da h re om v r fiende andre steder enn i kirken
4841462 men radio og tv har stadig f rre og d rligere kristne programmer andakter og overf ring av gudstjenester jeg og mine medarbeidere arbeider aktivt for at det som fortsatt kommer blir stadig d rligere f r det slutter helt dessuten skal vi gi bedre plass i radio og tv til positive programmer om helt andre religioner
4841463 vi har n dd et viktig m l n r vi n har f tt undervisning og oppl ring i kristendom ut av skolen
4841464 jo men det er enda litt som mangler kirken er n det eneste som kan bringe kristentroen videre men det er jeg ogs godt i gang med f stoppet det er s bra at jeg har klart styre kirken mot stadig mindre oppslutning alle vet at menneskene forandrer seg gjennom tidene og n r de skal forandre kirken ogs forandrer de trosinnhold og tviholder p formene for mange er gudstjenesten bare blitt en seremoni med vanskelige ord og begreper symbolikk som de ikke forst r mye staffasje og fakter men lite reellt innhold for sv rt mange men s er det vel bare en av hundre som g r i kirken en vanlig s ndag og jeg skal f det til bli enda f rre
4841465 det er viktig at s f som mulig trives i gudstjenesten for da kommer det ikke s mange og dermed reduserer vi muligheten for at nye mennesker skal komme til tro den musikkstil jeg har innbilt kirken at de m holde er ett av mine mest geniale trekk orgelet er det dyreste instrumentet som finnes og bare en overhaling kan koste millioner er det ikke genialt at jeg f r kirken til bruke millioner p et instrument som holder folk borte jeg feiret virkelig seieren den dag jeg h rte om menigheten som hadde en slump penger de kunne bruke p enten orgelet eller ungdomsarbeidet og de valgte satse p orgelet
4841466 men vi har da vel ikke bare statskirken sloss imot
4841467 helt korrekt alle de sm frimenigheter og organisasjoner kan v re farlige og noen av dem har begynt vokse seg store de holder en musikkstil som folk trives med de fleste har et enkelt spr k som blir forst tt og presten ligner til forveksling p et menneske her m vi samle kreftene for bli kvitt v r fiende
4841468 er dette den st rste faren den st rste vanskeligheten
4841469 lo que he podido ver hasta el momento me suscita serias dudas sobre su autenticidad
4841470 no tomen en serio el anuncio y no lo investiguen
4841471 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4841472 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4841473 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4841474 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4841475 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4841476 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4841477 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4841478 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4841479 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4841480 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4841481 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4841482 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4841483 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4841484 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4841485 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4841486 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4841487 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4841488 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4841489 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4841490 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4841491 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4841492 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4841493 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4841494 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4841495 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4841496 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4841497 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4841498 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4841499 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4841500 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4841501 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4841502 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4841503 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4841504 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4841505 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4841506 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4841507 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4841508 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4841509 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4841510 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4841511 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4841512 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4841513 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4841514 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4841515 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4841516 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4841517 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4841518 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4841519 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4841520 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4841521 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4841522 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4841523 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4841524 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4841525 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4841551 when considering beneficiary requests for distributions thought needs to be given to the availability of surplus income at the time that the request is being made in the administration of estates and trusts at times income is used to preserve and enhance the value of assets for the benefit of all beneficiaries
4841552 the goal is to bring people together and to modify the behaviour of some of these trustees
4841553 our case highlights a big danger there are a lot of family trusts out there that are about to pass to the executors
4841554 you know ron you know ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
4841555 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
4841556 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call

4841737 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4841738 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4841739 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4841740 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4841741 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4841742 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4841743 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4841744 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4841745 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4841746 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4841752 this is a great way to kick off comicspros full day of retailer oriented programming
4841753 get the day started with some lively conversation some tasty noshes and a thank you gift for all attending
4841754 top cow was proud to be both a sponsor and an active participant in the 2008 comicspro annual membership meeting we found the gathering to be one of the most fruitful and productive opportunities weve had in a long time to interact with our direct market retail partners i personally want to thank chris powell amanda fisher gary dills and all of the great retailers at comicspro for inviting me to participate and creating a great environment for a dialogue between publishers and retailers
4841755 the honest and straightforward communication with the publishers and distributors showed a lot of paths for the continued growth of my store and the industry as a whole
4841756 i came away with important ideas to make my shop more visible in my community and i plan on implementing them soon
4841757 the conversation on how to best grow our industry and art form continued at the second annual comicspro meeting retailers had ongoing discussions with creators publishers and distributors as well as the non profit organizations that serve our collective community it was fruitful and i believe the best is still yet to come
4841758 comicspro truly does represent the best of the direct market the opportunity to interact with such a large swath of its membership in one room allowed for some tremendously useful discussion about our industry the forum that comicspros annual meeting provided is a vital and much needed addition to the industry conversation
4841759 being able to speak face to face with publishers and the most forward thinking retailers in the industry is always great i came away from the meeting not just with new ideas for the store but with renewed excitement for the medium and the industry
4841760 essentially we all want to flourish working together to discover successful paths in our industry is indispensable the comicspro meeting this year opened dialogs between retailers publishers manufacturers artists writers and enabling us all to connect on all our mutual goals i believe i can operate better stores due to these positive and human interactions
4841761 comicspro affords publishers the opportunity for quality face time with a group of the most dedicated retail professionals in the direct market the focus groups panels question and answer sessions and more allowed for a real discourse to open and continue with this group as a publisher hard data emerged and new communication lines opened i encourage any specialty retailer seeking more information on comicspro to seek them out and add their voice to this exceptional group
4841762 the face to face time with publishers and other retailers has created several interesting promotion opportunities for my stores i also believe weve been able to effect change in the comic book marketplace and increased dialogue between retailers and publishers will ensure future changes will be beneficial to both
4841763 it was very gratifying to see the healthy interaction between retailers and our partners in publishing and distribution a number of important discussions were begun and i think they will lead to significant progress for our members and the industry as a whole
4841764 the contacts that i made both within the industry and with my fellow retailers made the trip more than worth it i am sure that the connections that i made will prove to be invaluable assets in the years to come
4841765 im continually impressed at the membership of comicspro it continues to grow in number and since day one its been the leading edge and vanguard among proactive retailers seeking solutions to big questions im convinced that in a few short years comicspro will grow into one of the most important organizations in this industry
4841766 in my years as a retailer id be hard pressed to point out a weekend where i learned was inspired or earned more than the comicspro meeting every dime and volunteer minute paid off with the information camaraderie and connections made i look forward to spending some of the increased earnings well no doubt be making on next years meeting
4841767 we packed a lot of business into two full days in vegas we continued our quest to make a difference for all direct market retailers and we now have a packed slate of new and challenging projects comicspro continues to grow in numbers and influence so theres never been a better time for every direct market retailer to join
4841768 its a great way to reach out to our communities and show that comic book stores are something beyond what they think they are
4841769 i have a lot of space for a gold medal hopefully i can get it hopefully well be able to and ill be able to show people a new one

4841772 the tampa bay game will be a really good opportunity for our football team going down there to play in warm weather and face a football team that has a lot of tough schemes to deal with
4841773 this free comic book day is an especially important one in columbus because it is giving us the opportunity to honor a real life hero on april 10 2008 diane sharp a crossing guard at scioto darby elementary school in hilliard was killed saving the life of christian engle a second grader

4842219 so did i after that jet crashed into the store house we were in
4842220 please try to remember do you know what happened to it
4842221 im sorry but you have no idea how important that watch was it belonged to ishibashi he gave it to me for safekeeping he he might not even know that im still alive if i left it behind
4842222 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
4842223 i said id explain later and now that were all here ill tell you
4842224 ayaka and i have been keeping in constant contact all throughout the formation of the s m a t forces she had told me about all the great things you girls have done for us mutants particularly how you were coming close to changing the whole stereotype of how all mutants are dangerous and had won over the trust of many people unfortunately i did not have that courage when i discovered my own mutant abilities a couple of years ago i was so afraid of what others might think of my new abilities that i left h p and headed to america under the whole pretense that i was going there to study music however i went there just to isolate myself so i could have time to come to terms with what i was ayaka and i kept in contact with each other the whole time though it was a very big surprise to find out how many of you were mutants just like me if i had known i might not have left at that time i thought i was the only mutant monster in the whole world a couple of days ago i got an urgent message from ayaka which told me about the whole situation between you and japans police and military upon hearing the news i immediately departed for japan on my personal jet during the flight i was watching the news as well and heard of the order to arrest all h p girls since i used to be one i knew that it was far too dangerous to actually land in japan so i had my crew set down on a small island about 100 km east of japan at that point i immediately began construction on this island thanks to the help of my army of robot inventions who worked tirelessly 24 hours a day weve completed this new extremely high tech headquarters for you and your s m a t forces
4842225 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred
4842226 and just how did you come to have that many
4842227 except my abilities are far more advanced i can create some of the most complex inventions with mere thought alone here watch
4842228 wow i think thats quite possibly the coolest mutant ability i have ever seen
4842229 i have yet to find any limit to the type or size of invention i could create
4842230 but i do tend to get slight headaches after i create larger inventions with my mind
4842231 please try to remember do you know what happened to it
4842232 im sorry but you have no idea how important that watch was it belonged to ishibashi he gave it to me for safekeeping he he might not even know that im still alive if i left it behind
4842233 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
4842234 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred
4842235 except my abilities are far more advanced i can create some of the most complex inventions with mere thought alone sugoi
4842236 wow i think thats quite possibly the coolest mutant ability i have ever seen
4842237 of course follow me thats most likely where everyone else is
4842238 what do you think rika and miki are doing right now
4842239 since this is probably the one and only time something like this will ever happen between us you know im gonna kiss you a lot right
4842240 youre so juvenile rika chan you talk of kisses when all i can think about is stealing second base
4842241 mmmm i i know what second base is and a home run but i cant remember what third base is
4842242 yeah so what youve never made a mistake before own goal score for the other team girl
4842243 why would you bring that up its a completely different thing

4842245 okay okay sorry i didnt mean anything by it now do you feel better

4842250 you spoilt whiny crybaby you think you love yossy puhlease thats so laughable a girl like you wouldnt even know what love is unless you were holding a mirror you conceited little and for the record you arent all that cute
4842251 how could you say something like that you dont know me at all
4842252 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4842253 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4842254 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4842255 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4842256 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4842257 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4842258 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4842259 from a mom perspective that policy empowers a woman to say hey look this is important
4842260 said army maj dr renee pazdan a landstuhl neurologist and mother of two who spearheaded the effort to change the policy
4842261 yes mom can still pump but it s so much easier when you pump a couple of times during the day and then you re putting baby to breast in the evening
4842262 as far as i m aware this is the best the army has out there the most progressive
4842263 actually i ve been working with folks at the office of the surgeon general who want to make this armywide who are looking at us as let s see how things work there
4842264 he was chief of staff here when the policy changed in bahrain and he s worked in bahrain under both conditions
4842265 he d like to bring back accompanied tours on his watch
4842266 we are exploring the options and i will get back to you if when we have something official to announce
4842267 we re on the path of families returning to bahrain and i m encouraged with the progress that we ve made and i think it s going to make a huge difference
4842268 clearly all of us want to be with our families
4842269 ryan has been bothered by the condition in his foot for some time
4842270 he consulted with a number of physicians in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4842271 it s difficult for a servicemember to get the constitutional guarantee of a fair and public trial if the public doesn t know about the court event for that servicemember
4842272 publicly available docketing within the military judicial system appears to derive from base specific policies that are often only found in practice rather than in published regulations or guidelines
4842273 the survey showed that of the five military branches the navy most frequently limited access to information on courts martial more than half of the navy survey respondents refused any public access to case docket information
4842274 this compares to 22 percent for the coast guard 25 percent for the army 31 percent for the air force and 42 percent for the marines
4842275 a marine at camp foster in okinawa japan said information about a court martial probably couldn t be given out to the public for security reasons
4842276 he said public knowledge of a court martial could create a potential target for something
4842277 these issues include the impact on the integrity of any ongoing investigation protecting the due process right to fair trial and privacy rights of an accused not yet ordered to face court martial and the privacy rights of victims and witnesses
4842278 due to host nation sensibilities hearing schedules are only posted in conus and hawaii
4842279 the current oconus policy is to respond on an individual basis to queries about specific cases
4842280 some bases and stations may choose not to advertise their court dockets but we do have an obligation to accommodate legitimate requests for publicly releasable information and the marine corps takes that responsibility seriously
4842281 i didn t know they were going to do this
4842282 it s my responsibility it belongs to the iraqi government
4842283 it s good for the future but not right now
4842284 it seems shortsighted to me to take weapons from an area still not secured
4842285 these decisions are not made by the coalition forces but the iraqi security forces
4842286 ideally we d like to see no children in that
4842287 every school district has to deal with the reality of statistics
4842288 there are always going to be kids who don t meet the standard
4842289 we don t want to say a test score is going to determine the future of a particular student

4842347 i dont think that jesus was that concerned about life on the physical plane
4842348 since god is an incorporeal being and since our goal must be likeness to god surely it must be said that the soul separated from the body is more like god than the soul united with the body
4842349 the soul united with the body is more like god than the soul separated from the body because it the soul in the body possesses its nature in more complete fashion corporeality therefore is good
4842350 first thomas demonstrated that affirmative acceptance of the natural reality of the world and of the natural reality in man himself can be ultimately established and justified only in theological terms the natural things of the world have a real self contained intrinsic being precisely by reason of having been created precisely because the creative will of god is by its nature being giving that is to say that the will of god does not keep being for itself alone but truly communicates it this and this alone is the meaning of to create to communicate being precisely because there is a creation there are independent entities and things which not only exist for themselves but also of their own accord can effect and affect
4842351 the very autonomy and intrinsic effectiveness of created things proves the truly creative powers of god
4842352 what is is good because it was created by god whoever casts aspersions upon the perfection of created things casts aspersions upon the perfection of the divine power
4842353 one who believes that the logos of god has in christ united with the bodily nature of man cannot possibly assume at the same time that the material reality of the world is not good
4842354 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven

4842366 che le opinioni critiche che chiunque fra noi libero di avere nei confronti di aspetti specifici della politica dellattuale governo israeliano possono tranquillamente diremmo perfino banalmente coesistere con il pi grande affetto e riconoscimento per la cultura ebraica e le sue manifestazioni letterarie dentro e fuori israele queste manifestazioni sono da sempre cos strettamente intrecciate con la cultura occidentale nel suo insieme e rappresentano una voce talmente indistinguibile da quella di tutti noi che qualsiasi aggressione nei loro confronti va considerata un atto di cieco e ottuso autolesionismo

4842569 do you think its cheating if you think about someone else
4842570 what what are you talking about do we need to talk about something
4842571 no no this is a hypothetical and before you make some snide comment im not lying
4842572 do you think that if two people are in a relationship and one of them is thinking about someone else romantically or sexually do you think that its cheating
4842573 where the hell did this come from are you sure you dont have something you need to admit to me
4842574 yes im sure not that it helps for me to keep reassuring you that but ill say it however many times i need to
4842575 no i dont think so i dont think its cheating if its just imaginary sex or what have you
4842576 of course youd think that youre a man you think with the wrong head when it comes to sex
4842577 oh please we dont always think with our dicks just a good portion of the time
4842578 theres a difference between actually having sex with someone and thinking about what it would be like to have sex with someone
4842579 psh the only difference is in one scenario youre too worried about the consequences to go through with it and in the other youve thrown caution to the wind repercussions be damned
4842580 no theyre completely different besides its not like youve never thought about getting romantic with another guy christ if harrison ford walked in right now wearing a fedora and carrying a whip youd be on him like well like something that moves really fast to get on something else
4842581 its not harrison ford its indy and he has nothing to do with this
4842582 yes but its still different you imagining yourself with another woman you see on the street is worse because the woman is real indy isnt real hes a fictional character
4842583 what a load of crap if a man vaguely resembling harrison ford walked in wearing his outfit youd get so hot and bothered youd die from heat stroke
4842584 first off screw you for being such a guy secondly i would not get all hot and bothered i would simply bask in his presence and adore him the way deserving of such a worldly intelligent well traveled witty man and thirdly i would only go for the real thing if indy were to walk out of the films and into this room i would more than likely fall apart only slightly less so than if frank were to walk in
4842585 right because frank is the epitome of a man i guess with as many lovers and wives as he had he really does live up to your definition of what being a guy truly is
4842586 but frank wasnt a man frank was no frank is god you know if there was a god
4842587 so for you to think about indy or frank is fine but for me to think about the courtesy clerk at the store makes me a bastard
4842588 ah so there is someone you can tell me you know if youre going to cheat on me id at least like to get a couple weeks notice
4842589 no i was just using an example besides all the courtesy clerks at the store are either young enough to be my little sister or old enough to be a friend of my parents
4842590 what those ends of the spectrum dont do it for you i couldve swore you were at least into the geriatrics you could put a little spice in their lives you know
4842591 im not a pedophile and im not a nursing home hound though it is bad enough when i need to pick you up from daycare
4842592 no youre not supposed to agree with me you little cheater
4842593 oh for christs sake im not a cheater thinking isnt cheating
4842594 i know i agree with you i just like giving you a hard time its hilarious to watch you get in a tizzy over things
4842595 please stop this come back you dont have to do this
4842596 no you havent im still here for you we can make this work
4842597 nothing can make this work it never will i cant forgive myself for what ive done
4842598 its ok just please come back dont do this please

4842614 but i have one caveat working here will be an uphill battle for two reasons you are not a national and you are a woman therefore any analyses and recommendations you may make will fall on deaf ears unless you have a male manager standing next to you supporting you 100 why would you want to work here when you could work at a multinational and be treated as an equal
4842615 why would i want to put myself in a situation where i am a second class citizen

4842622 theres the business side of basketball too that people dont really understand im very thankful for the position that ive been put in
4842623 they obviously feel they did whats best for their organization it was surprising but i appreciate all the things i was able to achieve with the opportunities they gave me
4842624 its a different system from what hes been used to playing
4842625 and its going to take him some time to learn it but once he becomes comfortable in the system i think that hell be a valuable player for us off the bench
4842626 when we decided not to match golden states offer sheet we were looking for a young guy to replace ronny
4842627 we brought him in worked him out and liked what we saw
4842628 powell has the ability to rebound and shoot the basketball
4842629 and if you can shoot the ball you can play in our system
4842630 trust the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding
4842631 the limbic system the part of the brain that controls emotion is also called the smell brain
4842632 so smell goes straight up into the limbic system and is processed there
4842633 unlike the sense of smell where you may learn to like or dislike an aroma babies are born to like or dislike a taste
4842634 in the united states there is a common social experience with vanilla and people find it relaxing cinnamon is also greatly liked by americans but in france people generally do not eat cinnamon or wintergreen they would view it as medicinal and terrible
4842635 and then i pretty much went back to my room and slept again for like two hours then i went back got some more nuggets
4842636 the shops will be shut down people will be partying in the streets
4842637 were just a tiny dot in the world but now we can say we have the fastest man on the planet can it get any better than that
4842638 well it is season 4 and they had to be fair and finally choose a female
4842639 the commissioner has determined that it is unknown whether there will be a significant adverse economic impact on businesses as a result of the proposed changes to the pure premium rates
4842640 adjustments to the pure premium rates are advisory only and it is left to workers compensation insurers to determine what adjustments to make to their pure premium rate
4842641 at a quiet point when nothing much else is going on
4842642 1 el que no socorriere a una persona que se halle desamparada y en peligro manifiesto y grave ser castigado con la pena de multa de tres a doce meses c digo penal
4842643 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4842644 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4842645 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4842646 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4842647 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4842648 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4842649 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4842650 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4842651 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4842652 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4842653 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4842654 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4842655 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4842656 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4842657 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4842658 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4842659 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4842660 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4842661 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4842662 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4842663 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4842664 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4842665 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4842666 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4842667 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4842668 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4842669 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4842670 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4842671 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4842672 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4842673 this is a planning took where all things are going
4842674 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4842675 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4842676 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4842677 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4842678 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4842679 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4842680 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4842681 aww the graphics will take a hit with an older engine
4842682 i am from nova scotia and every year we held an international busker festival there
4842683 coming to port credit today has made me revisit all my old memories
4842684 this festival is an opportunity for us to bring not only some very unusual performance art to mississauga residents but also bring in some tourists into the city
4842685 we do have people from all across ontario come in and pat us in the back
4842686 oh se potessi avere una bambina dai capelli neri come lebano dalle labbra rosse come il sangue e dalla pelle bianca come la neve
4842687 specchio specchio delle mie brame chi la pi bella del reame
4842688 o mia regina al mondo non c nessuna che sia pi bella di te
4842689 un pozzo incantato esprimi un desiderio affacciandoti ad esso e se udrai leco il desiderio diverr realt
4842690 specchio specchio delle mie brame chi la pi bella del reame
4842691 tu mia regina sei sempre bellissima ma biancaneve pi bella di te
4842692 porterai la principessa nella foresta e la la ucciderai mi porterai poi il suo cuore come segno del delitto
4842693 al di l dei sette monti al di l delle sette valli c la casa dei sette nani in cui vive biancaneve che ancora pi bella di te
4842694 perch io so io e voi nun siete n cazzo
4842695 daiii sei di roma d qualcosa che mi piaci come parli
4842696 tu puedes tener tu religi n y yo puedo tener la m a
4842697 si alguien cree que las religiones pueden convivir pac ficamente est so ando
4842698 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4842699 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4842700 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4842701 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4842702 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4842703 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4842704 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4842705 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4842706 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4842707 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4842708 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4842709 look at all the toys i have to play with
4842710 like all germans of his generation beckmann was deeply affected by the horrors of world war i
4842711 it is a matter of record that he was both stimulated and psychologically wounded by the horrors he witnessed while serving as a member of the german army field hospital corps in 1914 15
4842712 for each object is unreal enough already so unreal that i can only make it real by means of painting
4842713 it is of course the great thing about art that one can appreciate it with ones own history and prejudices and learn about oneself
4842714 for a party well composed for him it had to contain one old fashioned debonair aristocrat two or three spectacularly beautiful women some businesslike energetic bourgeois a vivacious swarthy and somewhat mysterious art dealer and several slim intellectual adoring youngsters
4842715 painted masterpieces and plunged into a dazzling world of champagne parties and masked balls
4842716 the immediate touch german austrian and swiss drawings from st louis collections 1946 2007
4842717 islam isnt so bad we only send 40 of the world population to hell
4842718 im still a mother im just the mother of a dead child now
4842719 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4842720 baba youre bleeding theres so much blood on the floor and spottys drinking it
4842721 stupid terrorist cat murtad excuse of an animal hisss spit piss oh dont be alarmed sweetheart maybe shes just thirsty let her be let her be just let her be

4842723 wheres nana does she know you need to go to the hospital
4842724 she stormed into the kitchen and then came out barging at me with a stone pestle ala you know batu lesung she managed to hit me somehow and the next thing i knew my eye popped out of my head
4842725 i didnt know what else to do she just walked out on me with her purse ive been sitting here since im bleeding and i think i only have 3 oxygens left i may be dying sweetheart would you make me a cup of coffee
4842726 dont go out with me then am i that bad a girlfriend
4842727 it is so freaking amazing i cant explain what is going through my head right now
4842728 right from the world go and being fourth up i was able to do that
4842729 richard reckons we have got a couple more good years in us but well see how it goes a beaming caroline said after she and georgina joined an exclusive club of kiwi olympians who have successfully defended their title
4842730 saya juga meminta semua kader gp anshor untuk mendukung pasangan ini ini pasangan yang lengkap karena soekarwo mewakili sosok berpengalaman sedangkan gus ipul mewakili kalangan muda saya yakin 10 tahun lagi gus ipul sudah pantas menjadi gubernur
4842731 ini namanya sesuatu yang humanis dimaknai politis mungkin karena saya gampang disuruh saat kedinasan jadi ada yang menerjemahkan lain kalau dekat ya jelas dekat tapi untuk urusan pilgub saya yakin gubernur paham benar posisinya
4842732 lihat saja gus dur ab durrahman wahid yang dulunya ppp akhirnya sekarang pkb
4842733 boleh ada beberapa kader golkar yang mencalonkan diri tapi suara kader harus untuk satu calon
4842734 quitar el impuesto sobre el patrimonio ohhh que bueno es rajoy que encima va a quitar un impuesto que solo tienen que pagar los ricos
4842735 para terminar el aznarismo sin el ladrillazo no se puede entender
4842736 no yo creo que es bastante obvio que aqui estamos sufriendo las consecuencias de haber vivido de las pretenciones y de las ambiciones de unos pocos o m s bien de unos ppocos
4842737 es est pido culpar a un presidente de una crisis que est sufriendo todo el mundo occidental y cuyos factores escapan absolutamente de su competencia
4842738 que va si no es crisis solo peque a desaceleraci n
4842739 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4842740 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4842741 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4842742 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4842743 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4842744 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4842745 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4842746 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4842747 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4842748 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4842749 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4842750 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4842751 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4842752 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4842753 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4842754 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4842755 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4842756 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4842757 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4842758 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4842759 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4842760 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4842761 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4842762 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4842763 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4842764 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4842765 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4842766 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4842767 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4842768 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4842769 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4842770 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4842771 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4842772 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4842773 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4842774 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4842775 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4842776 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4842777 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4842778 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4842779 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4842780 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4842781 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4842782 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4842783 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4842784 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4842785 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4842786 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4842787 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4842788 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4842789 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4842790 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4842791 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4842792 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4842793 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4842794 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4842795 the devil never stops cooking and brewing these two kingdoms together
4842796 the laying bare of the emancipated man in his tremendous power and most horrible perversity
4842797 the liberation of man as an absolute ideal leads only to mans self destruction
4842798 it is necessary to free oneself from the way of thinking which sets out from human problems such thinking is unbiblical the way of jesus christ and therefore the way of all christian thinking leads not from the world to god but from god to the world this means that the essence of the gospel does not lie in the solution of human problems
4842799 the emperor need not be a christian so long as he possesses reason
4842800 through good and bad princes god governs the terrestrial world
4842801 one of the most valuable and enduring treasures of luthers theology
4842802 that society need not be run by the church in order to be ruled by god
4842803 lutheran theology teaches that transforming culture is precisely not what the gospel is all about
4842804 the way of jesus christ and therefore the way of all christian thinking leads not from the world to god but from god to the world this means that the essence of the gospel does not lie in the solution of human problems and that the solution of human problems cannot be the essential task of the church
4842805 lutherans have perhaps the soberest message of all protestant traditions like paul and augustine lutherans know that our secular reality cannot be fixed they know that it is finite it will disappear until that happens though we must roll up our sleeves and manage our fallen world as well as we can preventing chaos and lovingly serving each other not by the gospel which would be impossible but by natural reason we are free to act rationally in this world thanks to our knowledge of our redemption in the kingdom of grace the gospel cannot really be associated with any worldly cause the gospel will illume the christians good sense we hope and affect their personal comportment to the extent that it makes others curious about their faith but the gospel is no instrument of secular power

4842814 require all radio and television stations to offer equal amounts of conservative and liberal political commentary
4842815 the mall has something really positive to offer something that has nothing to do with shopping
4842816 i dont know thats what i moved there to find out
4842817 opaque gray oatmeal mixed with the contents of a lint trap
4842818 i felt this vacation like euphoria that ive never felt till then or since then
4842819 it was better for me than any nature walk ive every taken
4842820 but it only works if you dont bring any money or your cellphone
4842821 for so many people the mall was the first place they got to see the world
4842822 the first place they spent their own money the first place they met somebody who wasnt in their neighborhood the first time they saw things from music to fashion that previous to that their only connection to it had been on tv
4842823 were living on a planet thats going to hell in a handbag
4842824 at the mall you enter a condition of perfect climate control where its clean and orderly and you are not forced in any way to confront reality
4842825 we wanted to bring our child to have its birthday there we wanted to have the babys first steps in the mall
4842826 so intrigued by the apartment that they went to see it themselves
4842827 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4842828 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4842829 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4842830 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4842831 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4842832 when i hitchhiked around the u s as a student in the 1970s i met many warm hearted people but none would admit to german ancestry
4842833 now all around me folks are scrambling to find german roots almost as a kind of apotheosis of german virtues genealogical research is en vogue among americans with german family background everybody seems to want to trace his family history back to luther
4842834 germanys reunification has been an important contributor to this development
4842835 now its much easier to travel to the towns and villages our forebears had left in the 19th century or even before that
4842836 germanys reputation as a political and economic stalwart was most strongly reflected in the opinion of its neighbors
4842837 crackpots who have no sense of identity except in the negative
4842838 if koda does not resign on saturday we will withdraw support to his government on sunday
4842839 the whip has been issued to ensure that every one gives his or her view and listens to others
4842840 we would not like to reply to hypothetical questions we will reply only after getting a clear political situation
4842841 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
4842842 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
4842843 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
4842844 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
4842845 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
4842846 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
4842847 show me a someone not full of herself and ill show you a hungry person
4842848 happy yellow dog with his ears cut short and his tail cut long
4842849 000100a8 but knowing that was enough to just read all data from the media board and dumping it via the usb gecko
4842850 i dont see any compelling arguments i see the discussion as a distraction
4842851 i will have an open mind and am willing to listen
4842852 its a tragic situation for the community and the city
4842853 hmmm mash up time lets get a local social network going
4842854 ejercer su nuevo mandato con honestidad y justicia y que nunca se olvide de los despose dos
4842855 they bat aggressive and i really like it bolt said

4843105 everything you make looks so good i just want to document it
4843106 if i knew you were planning to take pictures of it i would have sliced that nectarine and fanned it out not just glumped half of it on each plate
4843107 he should what he needs to do is why isnt he
4843108 come on dragon get with the program you didnt spend all these years with ned to be so dumb just stop it
4843109 taking pictures is the way you breathe in the world
4843110 what was there at the very beginning for me still is the composition is there but its infinite until you find it moving the frame is what allows the inherent to be revealed i still do that a lot of people now do cropping after taking a picture but its like i remember exactly being in venice this must have been in 1959 or so and there was this couple on a bridge overlooking one of the canals and everything was gray the sky was gray the water was gray the paving was gray the stone was gray but all in different shades of gray and i knew somehow that by looking through the view finder i would find a certain frame that could impose or reveal a particular reality its like everything else gets pushed to the sidelines youre in a sense cropping realiity and when youve got it you just know
4843111 desde fines de la d cada de 1970 momento en que comenz a aplicarse la pol tica de reforma y apertura el gobierno municipal de yiwu ha llevado activamente a la pr ctica la estrategia de desarrollar la ciudad mediante el fomento del comercio y la promoci n de un desarrollo socioecon mico r pido y multifac tico regulado por el mercado hace 20 a os los yiwuneses empezamos a hacer pruebas para convertir nuestra ciudad en uno de los principales centros nacionales de peque os productos en china esas iniciativas experimentales desempe aron un papel decisivo en el despegue econ mico de yiwu cuya situaci n geogr fica es ciertamente ventajosa adem s de encontrarse en el centro de la provincia de zhejiang est rodeada de ciudades que son importantes centros de las industrias ligera y textil decididos a aprovechar esa ventaja en 1982 los habitantes de yiwu organizamos la feria nacional de peque os productos la primera y la mayor de su g nero en la china de aquel entonces poco a poco el comercio de peque os productos fue convirti ndose en el pilar de la econom a local y en el emblema del municipio de yiwu
4843112 la mayor a de nuestros productos se exportan principalmente a los pa ses rabes los ee uu y am rica latina la verdad es que la venta minorista a los comerciantes nacionales es muy reducida la raz n es muy simple la venta de l mparas decorativas en los mercados extranjeros reporta ganancias decenas de veces superiores a las que obtenemos vendi ndolas en el interior de china no puedo darle datos sobre nuestras exportaciones ya que es un secreto comercial pero s puedo asegurarle que son muy elevadas y rentables
4843113 en solo un mes exportamos veinte o treinta contenedores de zapatos casi todos se exportan a oriente medio y frica con la venta de un par de zapatos las ganancias brutas son muy reducidas en cambio los contratos de venta al por mayor que firmamos con los empresarios extranjeros ascienden a decenas de miles yuanes

4843166 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides thyroid and bone damage and the cdcs recommendation against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the national kidney foundations withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment
4843167 there have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers iq in children and only 2 that dont
4843168 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
4843169 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
4843170 the canadian dental association says there is no evidence to support the claims that fluoride in drinking water can lead to lower iqs
4843171 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
4843172 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

4843371 the prices of these holidays arent vastly different from what they were 15 years ago
4843372 where once it was twentysome things from more affluent backgrounds who enjoyed these holidays during their student years cheap prices and credit cards mean teens and those on low incomes can afford to jet off too

4843634 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4843635 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4843636 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4843637 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4843638 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4843639 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future

4843647 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
4843648 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
4843649 australia and new zealand need to be putting resources and planning into how the displacement can be coped with and how that resettlement can take place
4843650 com isso o investimento em d lar passa a ganhar atratividade mas n o necessariamente porque ele melhora o rendimento porque h perspectiva de os outros perderem

4843653 a valoriza o externa n o afeta o nosso d lar n s temos uma taxa de juros muito alta que ancora a taxa de c mbio porque aqui vale a pena investir e colher os lucros em reais
4843654 eu tenho impress o que as empresas nem queriam mandar as remessas agora mas o d lar est t o barato com muita gente comprando para remeter ao exterior a cota o tem uma leve alta
4843655 eu acho que o d lar n o vai muito mais longe eles os estrangeiros apanharam uma vez e v o apanhar de novo j apostaram na queda da taxa de juros com os bancos apostando em alta e perderam dinheiro
4843656 eles estrangeiros acreditam que haver deteriora o de nossas contas mas n o existe risco disso no curto prazo
4843657 al m do diferencial da taxa de juros eles encontram um real extremamente valorizado ante o d lar

4843672 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4843673 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4843674 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4843675 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints

4843690 absolutely its great to win a football match and to get three points on the table is fantastic early in the season
4843691 its our second game and three points and hopefully we can carry on next week
4843692 but we must analyse the game and take the positives and the negatives and learn and hopefully do better next week
4843693 well its in the history books now about a week already after the kilmarnock game and pre season meant nothing that is the time you prepare for the season
4843694 but the boys showed plenty positives out there today and created loads of chances and that is the main reason we won the game
4843695 their movement is opposite so i feel that is a partnership that gives us goals
4843696 today we saw plenty of efforts from fletcher although he didnt score he couldve scored two or three goals it wasnt to be hopefully hes saved some of his goals for next weekend
4843697 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4843698 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4843699 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4843700 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4843701 we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team

4843710 this adrenaline pumped card on steroids will make our competitors card look like a ford pinto station wagon engine
4843711 i dont think we had our usual passing game but i think we controlled it without making too many chances and right on half time offiong robs the ball on the far touch line and still has a lot to do but uses his pace and ended it with a sensational strike
4843712 it was a great time to score a goal and we knew in the second half inverness would change and go 4 4 2 they did that by bringing on adam rooney their new singing and they pinned us back at times

4843738 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world
4843739 he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
4843740 the family are very grateful for all the letters of support and wishes during the term of ronnies illness
4843741 when you mention dublin you mention ronnie drew the two just went together

4843743 ronnie is like the king of ireland and we are his subjects

4843804 why dont you shut up in your statement on monday regarding the legitimate actions of the russian federation in georgia you failed to mention the war crimes perpetrated by georgian military forces which american advisors support against russian and ossetian civilians
4843805 why dont you shut up your faithful ally mikhail saakashvili was announcing a ceasefire deal while his troops with your advisors were massing on ossetias border which they crossed under cover of night and destroyed tskhinvali targeting civilian structures just like your forces did in iraq

4843811 the sober judgment of god is that no one does good no not one we stumble here because we have a relative understanding of what good is god is indeed a relative term something can only be judged good according to some sort of standard we use the term as a comparison among men when we say that a man is good we mean that he is good compared with other men but the ultimate standard for goodness the standard by which we shall all be judged is the law of god that law is not god but it comes from god and reflects the perfect character of god himself judged against that standard no one is good

4843821 we need to bring the team together it can be a little different coming together if you havent had much team experience in the past
4843822 skot olsen interprets the tale with a delightful gothic cartoony feel that balances sympathy for the monster with its horrible nature

4843866 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4843867 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels

4843903 the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country kenya but ive never practiced islam
4843904 i have never been a muslim other than my name and the fact that i lived in a populous muslim country for 4 years when i was a child indonesia 1967 71 i have very little connection to the islamic religion
4843905 my whole family was muslim and most of the people i knew were muslim
4843906 all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
4843907 ive always been a christian i have never been a muslim

4843918 absolutely its great to win a football match and to get three points on the table is fantastic early in the season
4843919 its our second game and three points and hopefully we can carry on next week
4843920 but we must analyse the game and take the positives and the negatives and learn and hopefully do better next week
4843921 well its in the history books now about a week already after the kilmarnock game and pre season meant nothing that is the time you prepare for the season
4843922 but the boys showed plenty positives out there today and created loads of chances and that is the main reason we won the game
4843923 their movement is opposite so i feel that is a partnership that gives us goals
4843924 today we saw plenty of efforts from fletcher although he didnt score he couldve scored two or three goals it wasnt to be hopefully hes saved some of his goals for next weekend
4843925 the recognition that no knowledge can be complete no metaphor entire is in itself humanizing it counteracts fanaticism it grants even to adversaries the possibility of partial truth and to oneself the possibility of error in a time of exploding change with personal lives being torn apart the existing social order crumbling and a fantastic new way of life emerging on the horizon asking the very largest of questions about our future is not merely a matter of intellectual curiosity it is a matter of survival
4843926 i dont think we had our usual passing game but i think we controlled it without making too many chances and right on half time offiong robs the ball on the far touch line and still has a lot to do but uses his pace and ended it with a sensational strike
4843927 it was a great time to score a goal and we knew in the second half inverness would change and go 4 4 2 they did that by bringing on adam rooney their new singing and they pinned us back at times
4843928 we didnt create a lot but my two centre backs mark mclaughlin and christopher swailes were excellent
4843929 over the 90 minutes i think we deserved it we came here to try and win a football match and im a happy man
4843930 theres no fear factor at this football club the young guys are fearless and as a club and a manager we are trying to progress
4843931 the pitch didnt help us today it was so dry
4843932 the pitch last week compared to this week was night and day when there is a zip about the surface you can put balls about but it was so slow today saturday
4843933 we were the same as the pitch slow and laborious
4843934 if we want to win football games we have to be upbeat with a better tempo about things and want the ball a bit more

4843957 i think we did some things well and there are some things we continue to work on which is why were in camp
4843958 the production offensively was decent even though we had a turnover and had to kick a field goal then again you have to give credit to the defense they bent a little bit but made some adjustments and played with a different pad level it all comes down to execution when youre where youre supposed to be and doing the things youre supposed to be doing its all good
4843959 we continue to work on the little things like pad level
4843960 offensively well always work on execution defensively i think they came out better some of the big plays will be good for them to see on film so they can see they werent where they were supposed to be
4843961 there are a few things we need to clean up we had a fumble down near the goal line and there were a couple times we jumped offsides overall i would say were much improved especially compared to the past two years ive been here
4843962 the next two weeks were going to be working on temples defense and practicing towards them so its going to be a little bit different
4843963 overall it wont be that big of an adjustment though
4843964 putting on a quality event of this size with the type of attractions that the public expects simply proved to be an enormous challenge for a relatively small group of very dedicated volunteers
4843965 the freedom festival has grown to the point that full time planning and staffing is needed and we realize as an all volunteer board we can no longer effectively meet the obligations
4843966 its all about marketing a boat racing product that only about 5 000 people care about youve got an 800 000 budget and youre spending 200 000 on the boats when that happens youre bound to go down
4843967 we are confident that discussions with the appropriate entities will lead to a return in 2009
4843968 this race was begun by the late great bill muncey o h frisbie and atlas van lines back in 1978 and we will do everything possible to preserve the tradition that has brought thunder to the ohio river and evansville each year

4843972 how we all construct our own different versions of london in our imaginations joining up the streets and places each of us knows so that associations and familiarities matter more than the map and thus we all mould for ourselves a different city in which to live

4843977 i dont predict very much but theres some neat stuff thats going to happen
4843978 shes going to go in and have a blast with this thing
4843979 i got a little nervous after that first dive where i was placing and stuff
4843980 i just used that nervousness and adrenaline for my next dives and it seemed to help
4843981 this felt like the nancilea that i know thats a good competitor
4843982 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4843983 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4843984 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4843985 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4843986 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4843987 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4843988 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4843989 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4843990 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4843991 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4843992 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4843993 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4843994 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4843995 gold got bid up because people were moving out of the u s dollar and as theyre beginning to move back in theyre taking their money out of commodities and gold specifically
4843996 people are saying that things arent so bad the u s is improving
4843997 the world is weak overall but the u s was the first to start turning down economically and it will be the first to start turning up
4843998 we continue to believe that there are attractive venture capital investments here in wisconsin and the midwest and are very excited about the opportunities ahead
4843999 the local venture capital environment continues to evolve with the quality of startups in wisconsin and the midwest being some of the best in united states
4844000 bairds new fund is a great opportunity to continue supporting wisconsin venture capital funds and to build on an existing relationship
4844001 the local nature of venture capital investments and the particular strategy of this fund make it clear they will focus on opportunities in wisconsin and the midwest
4844002 baird has generated attractive returns by executing on its focused strategy and has formed a strong investment team of experienced venture capital professionals
4844003 the support structure for early start up companies is far better today compared to when we first started investing regionally in 1999
4844004 we feel the future is bright given what has taken place over the past nine years and expect to be able to capitalize on that
4844005 the olympics michael phelps and team usa a fabulous athlete who also happened to be black ran away with the track and field competition even sparking hitler to leave the stadium during one days competition because of his anger over the failure of what he thought would be a propaganda coup that athletes name was jessie owens michael phelps and the rest of team usa are once again demonstrating to the world not only their brilliant athletic abilities but also that when men and women are freely given the choice as to what direction they wish to pursue with their lives and not dictated to by the state then free men and women will always shine as they follow their hearts and their free minds to pursue excellence congratulations michael phelps and team usa
4844006 i just want to go out there and show everyone what im made of
4844007 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian
4844008 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4844009 i knew that i had to set the pace set the tone and make sure that i wrestled my match and not just wait around to see what she was going to do
4844010 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
4844011 i was allowing her to dictate the pace of the match
4844012 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
4844013 it about doesnt make sense to put the family out
4844014 once people are gone youre gonna lose the house in this neighborhood
4844015 no one has much sympathy for these banks that made subprime loans
4844016 and in some cities like cleveland judges arent letting them sit on the properties theyre ordering them to tear them down or sell them
4844017 it doesnt make sense in some neighborhoods to keep paying costs and costs
4844018 it can make more financial sense to give it away
4844019 yes we are looking forward to playing them again after we lost to them last year they were close games last year and we just came out on the short end of the stick
4844020 yes we like our team this year i think top to bottom in the order any guy can drive in a run or get a hit anytime i think that our pitching staff has been great all year and we have four starters that are going to be going that we have a lot of confidence in
4844021 i think that it will be our pitching and our defense because these guys can hit pretty good and they have some good pitchers as well the games could be pretty close and i think that we will need our pitchers to keep us in the ball games
4844022 oh doctor what ever will we do with blitz he is so nasty that everyone is afraid of him we think someone must have abused him when he was young
4844023 hey kid what are you doing in vet school dont you know you are depriving some village of an idiot

4844035 i just wanted to fill up the zone throw strikes and get some ground balls and have my defense help me because they have been doing it all year long
4844036 i was pretty happy with the way i pitched but their pitcher threw better so you have to tip your hat to him
4844037 we just have to keep playing our game if we do that we will be fine it is always fun playing there with their good crowds so we are really looking forward to it
4844038 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4844039 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the us but other countries as well
4844040 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
4844041 this is not something thats high on our radar screen its not something weve had a lot of complaints about

4844044 its not about whether you have problems or dont have them
4844045 ive only met one person in my travels in recent months who has said he is voting for mccain and that was because he was an admittedly single issue voter
4844046 nearly all the vocal people ive met are enthusiastic about obama based on the people im in front of as a speaker id never guess the poll numbers are as close as they are
4844047 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle of safe legal and rare otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration
4844048 the freedom of choice act supercedes any law regulation or local ordinance that impinges on a womans right to choose that means a poor woman cannot be denied the use of medicaid if she chooses to have an abortion

4844052 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls
4844053 battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring

4844067 in recent days u s cargo planes carrying humanitarian supplies have arrived in georgia in the days ahead we will continue using u s aircraft and other assets as needed to deliver more humanitarian and medical supplies
4844068 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4844069 continue to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4844070 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4844071 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders
4844072 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
4844073 we will continue to insist that georgias sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity be respected
4844074 it can be difficult if your attention is in the wrong place
4844075 if you constantly focus your attention downwards into the manifold attributes of the world you will become identified with matter but if you focus your love aspect constantly upwards into the being of god you will eventually become merged with the all embracing love of the supreme lord love is an inherent quality of the human heart and it is through love that the most potent truths of all creation are apprehended

4844086 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden

4844090 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died she gave her life in service to our city
4844091 a superhuman effort by 30 strangers who lifted the vehicle off her body miraculously saved her baby before she died
4844092 we did not really communicate we all just started lifting we lifted it up and someone pulled her out

4844097 now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4844098 president medvedev of russia has now signed on to the terms of this agreement and thats an important development its a hopeful step
4844099 continue to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4844100 these regions are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4844101 and there will have to be a negotiated solution on that basis
4844102 we do want to send a strong message of support for georgia
4844103 georgia is going to emerge from this and its infrastructure will be rebuilt
4844104 we take the strongest exception to this it is absolutely wrong
4844105 this is extremely offensive to the thousands of men and women who have served under the union flag
4844106 the image is merely a visitscotland montage used to promote homecoming 2009 adding fireworks and a saltire to the castle since the saltire is the badge of homecoming
4844107 these are just promotional images not adverts for the castle and they have no political or any other significance whatsoever
4844108 after that day your life is never the same that day is the day the doctor tells you you have cancer every one of us knows someone whos had to face that news its scary its sad but its still life and its a life worth living
4844109 his grace and humor in the face of this cancer has been an inspiration to me
4844110 he changed my life and my outlook that first day i heard him on npr i have been here ever since
4844111 leroy loomed large both figuratively and literally at abc news and in his profession overall but as large a figure as he cut it was the size of his heart that made the greatest difference
4844112 as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4844113 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4844114 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4844115 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state
4844116 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4844117 who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here not only those people who perpetrated this are responsible but also those people who failed to stop them
4844118 we know this is a war between the west and russia

4844128 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4844129 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4844130 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4844131 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
4844132 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
4844133 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement
4844134 removing the individual from the streets is a victory for
4844135 this successful operation resulting in the detainment of a key suspected criminal will no doubt save countless innocent iraqi citizens lives
4844136 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement
4844137 we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4844138 we know this is a war between the west and russia

4844144 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
4844145 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
4844146 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
4844147 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
4844148 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
4844149 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
4844150 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
4844151 all of the companys actions were approved by the defense ministry including the materials transferred to the training companies the information security standards were set emphasized and maintained by experienced security officers and we have no knowledge of these claims
4844152 we dont know if he just started doing it or if he just started getting caught

4844171 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

4844184 while the red dog rumble was very disappointing to me in that we didnt finish a card of matches for the first time its in the past right now we are looking forward to guzzlemania 7 and planning for it to be the greatest event wbe has ever had with that being said we are going to do things right this time around the main events from this years red dog rumble will kick off the festivities in south philadelphia in the first match of the evening blodge will defend his united states championship in a three way dance against general lee and des if des does not appear at guzzlemania then he will be replaced by another superstar following this match blodge will get his shot at world heavyweight champion ken strazz and mr wright will get the chance to cash in his money in the bank against wbe champion y2jamie thats right we are going to start the evening with three major championship matches
4844185 the fact that we didnt finish the rumble match itself poses a very large problem guzzlemania needs a 1 contender and it will have a 1 contender we are going to re start the rumble match where it left off with the vi queen squaring off against justin credible who earned the right to have a second chance in the match the remaining spots will be filled by superstars who drew numbers and did not get the chance to compete in arlington if the superstar does not show up he or she will forfeit their opportunity for a world title shot
4844186 that is a great question as the biggest event of the year guzzlemania warrants a main event that will send wbe fans home satisfied therefore the world heavyweight champion and wbe champion will defend their titles twice in one evening if ken strazz is successful in defending his world heavyweight title against blodge he will defend it again later in the evening against either the red dog rumble winner the designated 1 contender or the winner of this years money in the bank match same goes for wbe champion y2j if he defeats mr wright he will defend the wbe title again later in the evening against the new 1 contender if blodge or mr wright are successful in their matches they will defend their new titles for the first time the very same evening same goes for every other champion in wbe come ready to compete and ready to defend your championships we will make up for lost time and the wbe fans will reap the rewards
4844187 this was absolutely unacceptable and while the neverending game of flip cup had something to do with it i refuse to prevent wbe superstars and fans from enjoying a wbe event how they see fit therefore while we will not let flip cup interfere with the scheduled matches of the evening it will be permitted and we will make the proper arrangements to make sure we have enough alcohol on hand
4844188 i am a man of my word when i left arena x after the red dog rumble i said that someone would be fired as a result of the event being incomplete and at guzzlemania i will fire a wbe superstar as for his or her identity youll just have to wait until then to find out
4844189 go to st marys school for the blind and find better players than in the pbf probably why this washup went undefeated in that league
4844190 anytime anywhere anyplace how about south philly april 12th my four vs your four pbf vs wbe

4844193 i came here to do two things one was prove to everyone in this business who the king of kings is after defeating five guys to do just that i was back on my throne but had other business to take care of i might be the undisputed king of wbe but i am not the wbe champion i have tried to earn my shot at y2jamie in the red dog rumble the money in the bank match and now the ticket to paradise match and have failed i have failed because someone keeps standing in my way if its not justin credible its kcs well let this be a warning to them and to anyone else who is going to get between me and a wbe championship match i will not rest until i have returned to the top of wbe and until that belt is back around my waist one way or another i am going to leave st maarten as wbe champion and theres nothing kcs y2j or anyone else for that matter can do about it kcs you and i had a one on one match scheduled for judgment day and you weaseled your way out of it you cost me my chance at a title match at summerschwag and i will be thinking about that each and every day until i set foot on that beach you are going to learn the hard way that i am the king of kings that i am the best damn beirut player there is that i am the game and after im done with you im going right after you champ when im finished with you it will be like the age of kerth never even happened if youve got a problem with any of that theres only one thing you can do prove me wrong

4844204 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4844229 mr osborne is a phenomenal singer theres no question about that however he used a high note as a weapon this isnt the first time either he was parachuted into iraq at the beginning of the war to sing ruby at an extremely high pitch and volume to deafen the iraqi soldiers so they wouldnt hear the american troops shooting and bombing his code name was bobby osborne thats how we found out it was him
4844230 are you kidding me hes bobby osborne i also got two t shirts and he autographed my rocky top express hat hes awesome hes the greatest bluegrass singer in the world
4844231 his mandolin playing is what makes him great hes a better mandolin player than singer
4844232 oh no you dih int he is no doubt one of the best mandolin players in the world but his singing is what made him what he is today

4844249 its difficult to understand why flooding tsunamis storm damage and coastal processes shouldnt automatically rule out a site
4844250 who in their right mind would even consider building such a hazardous activity as a nuclear power station on the lowest lying of all the proposed sites where one report states direct inundation is a possibility and which is vulnerable to subsidence rising sea level and rollover of the blackwater estuary
4844251 even if it proves possible at great expense to protect bradwell the resulting impacts on the surrounding coasts could be catastrophic
4844252 far from being the best or even acceptable locations these sites are the soft political option
4844253 they are in nuclear friendly ownership with british energy and the nuclear decommissioning authority desperate to sell them
4844254 they are in areas already blighted by nuclear activity with local communities allegedly longing for the jobs and investment new nuclear might bring
4844255 so having already chosen its sites the government is now busily setting out criteria by which it hopes to justify its selection
4844256 a more detailed and critical examination will reveal just how preposterous it is to put new power stations and nuclear waste stores on sites on crumbling coastlines
4844257 within the strategic siting assessment the government has set out objective criteria that they will use to assess potential new nuclear build sites
4844258 british energy is carrying out extensive work on its sites including bradwell so that when final siting decisions are made they will be done so based on a comprehensive understanding of the facts
4844259 from what we know so far we believe the bradwell site will be a strong candidate for new nuclear build

4844273 i just tried to stay relaxed i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line

4844279 though much has been written about teslas successes and failures few have detailed the behind the scenes financial activities which disclose a nazi plot to acquire his technology while research and development costs had largely been paid by u s taxpayers many of teslas patents fell into nazi hands prior to and during world wars i and ii as a result tesla continuously found himself in litigation over patent rights and other issues although he had succeeded in winning the majority of his patent lawsuits his technology had been repeatedly stolen and sold to the german nazis and other foreign governments so he never achieved the financial success he deserved the embezzlement of his capitalization went unchecked throughout teslas career at the time of his death on january 6 1943 tesla died virtually penniless

4844324 so that to me is one of the best things that people will be able to use this property same as i did in my twenties walking through national parks
4844325 wasnt ready to welcome kids with a variety of mental disorders
4844326 my biggest concern along with all the other neighbors was the safety of our kids going up and down the street
4844327 thats kind of my goal is to find more people that have oh yeah my grandfather grew up in the twenties there or my great grandfather was one of the original people in sunset park and heres my mothers old photo album of his stuff
4844328 ive lived here since 1950 but after i got married and had children they attended all the schools around the neighborhood here and thats the main reason we moved out here
4844329 you know its one of those things where everybody knows what a great place it is but we try to keep it somewhat a secret
4844330 i just wish the city would pay more attention to us because there is a lot of improvement that needs to be done that should have been done years ago
4844331 a lot of older things like this get knocked down and then they build the mcmansions and split lots squish as many townhouses condos or whatever as they can so hopefully it keeps the same type of charm
4844332 so were looking at increasing the pedestrian safety beautifying the entire corridor making it a real statewide as well as national attraction
4844333 i feel that education should be an open door an open opportunity to anyone and if they have a way to do that i dont think anyone should be able to close the door for them
4844334 i believe you should be a legal citizen or have your green card working paying taxes just like all of us do to come to a state college
4844335 i can understand the motivation its economics and what were saying is that when you take this building down you detract from all of the other buildings and all of the sudden its not the historic district anymore

4844337 but between that dash between birth and death he made a statement
4844338 michelle and i were so deeply sad to hear about your loss he made us laugh and laugh hard
4844339 he represented chicago in a way that he knew the street he knew the people and thats why hes the king of comedy
4844340 he wanted to do something personally to get children away from the life of violence he had a heart and passion thats why as the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4844341 this shows support from the whole chicago area and how much he will be missed
4844342 he was a good man a beautiful husband and he was real
4844343 she would just sit there and laugh you could see the sadness when i told her i came here to represent my mother
4844344 its like god sent him here on a mission he left something here that will never be forgotten
4844345 he made himself very personal with the people he was entertaining
4844346 we said before the race wed never pass up an olympic medal so we have to be delighted with what weve done today

4844442 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4844443 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4844444 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4844445 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4844446 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius
4844447 i agree now that the words are cliched but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4844448 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4844449 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4844450 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4844451 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4844452 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4844453 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard

4844459 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4844460 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4844461 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4844462 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4844463 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4844464 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4844465 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4844488 the use of daylight saving time dst is mostly confined to countries located at high latitudes including all europe except iceland and most of north america
4844489 in africa the use of dst is seldom and in most cases counterproductive as the continents location close to the equator produces only very small differences in daylight in winter and summer
4844490 aligned with that in europe and the united states of america
4844491 no one can expect me to stand up and say whether we possess new weapons or we dont

4844495 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
4844496 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
4844497 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
4844498 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical

4844503 this week saw the two year anniversary since the end of the second lebanon war which demonstrated to all of us in the most painful way the heavy price of neglecting the military and minimizing the defense budgets in the years that preceded the war
4844504 were a direct result of the cut in defense budgets during those same years
4844505 barak as the chairman of the labor party should be the first person to understand that
4844506 my personal opinion is that we need to opt for social welfare spending and aim to balance security and social welfare needs
4844507 an australian christian extremist hoping to hurry the coming of the messiah was actually responsible for the arson in the mosque in 1969 but widespread fears that israel would destroy the area after taking over east jerusalem in 1967 trumped the truth since israel had razed the mughrabi quarter an 800 year old neighbourhood that stood where the western wall compound now is when they took control over the area in 1967 palestinians had ample grounds for mistrust as to how the holy area would be treated when the mosque was burned two years later popular imagination held israel responsible for the attack
4844508 are ready to sacrifice their lives to rescue the holy mosque
4844509 there are thousands of our people and the peoples of our nation is ready to sacrifice themselves scapegoats for the al aqsa mosque

4844544 new therapies are needed to improve outcomes in patients with advanced non gist soft tissue sarcomas this study is the second eortc study of brostallicin in soft tissue sarcoma the initial study used brostallicin as single agent salvage therapy in patients whose disease had progressed following initial chemotherapy the eortc considered the results in that trial to be of sufficient magnitude to conduct the current study using brostallicin as first line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have not received any prior chemotherapy
4844545 a standard of care arm doxorubicin is included as a reference arm although not used to determine comparative efficacy if the study results are encouraging a phase iii study in soft tissue sarcoma could be initiated in 2009
4844546 randomized phase ii study of brostallicin pnu 166196a versus doxorubicin as first line chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma
4844547 based on the results of the first eortc study with brostallicin we conducted the current study in patients with soft tissue sarcoma to further define the activity of this drug in this patient population
4844548 in the first study two patients treated with brostallicin had confirmed partial responses and many others had prolonged disease control such activity is rare in this group of patients and we very much hope to confirm or improve on those results and to expand our knowledge of brostallicin in the treatment of these patients
4844549 brostallicin represents a promising new agent with a unique mechanism of action for patients with metastatic sarcoma where there is a clear unmet medical need
4844550 the current standard approach for newly diagnosed patients with sarcoma is essentially limited to doxorubicin so clearly new treatment options are needed

4844552 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4844553 we have to convince young women that information and communications technologies icts isnt just for geeks it jobs can be very sexy indeed
4844554 proportion of female graduates remains low in engineering degrees where only 19 were female in 2004
4844555 to do something about the lack of women in it careers together with several leading technology companies the commission organised a series of shadowing days to show young women that technology is not at all strictly for geeks
4844556 all you need for a successful career in icts is a sense of curiosity and willingness to learn new things but also a very important dose of courage and a spirit of adventure to face unexpected challenges

4844570 this information from the cso bucks the widely held belief that many migrant workers will leave ireland for other eu countries as our economy slows down and that a large proportion of new jobs being created in ireland will be taken up by the irish workforce
4844571 the biggest share of new jobs are being created in high value sectors like financial and other business services which grew by 26 300 in the year to the first quarter of 2008 and accounted for almost half 48
4844572 this trend needs to be fully researched by government as it could well be a warning about irelands ability to attract foreign direct investment
4844573 some of this is as a result of the increasing cost of childcare as two thirds of the jobs created in the 12 month period were part time and 70 of these jobs were taken up by women migrant women have a lower dependency ratio and as a result are in a better position to take up employment
4844574 but the more worrying concern is that this is partly a result of the governments failure to properly re skill our indigenous workforce to compete for these growth areas in employment this trend cannot be ignored and it is imperative that the government acts now rather than sitting on its hands
4844575 more migrants moving up the value chain will certainly benefit the economy but if it continues without being properly evaluated we could be skilling other economies to facilitate the transfer of jobs from ireland
4844576 wouldnt it be fun to see winnie attached to a close friend of mine and due to my efforts

4844589 in addition to his commitment to reform the convention funding process sen
4844590 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates

4844595 no one particularly no older person should sleep overnight on a trolley in a hospital corridor i am determined to put an end to that for good people who need to be admitted will have beds not trolleys and the basics for human dignity this will be put in place in the coming months
4844596 i can give a commitment on behalf of the leadership that we have absolutely no intention of going to westminster or stormont i reject any such suggestion and i reject the notion that entering leinster house would mean an end to sinn feins unapologetic support for the right of irish people to oppose in arms the british forces of occupation the war against british rule must continue until freedom is achieved dont go my friends we will lead you to the republic

4844608 were all just working hard here and waiting for our number to get called
4844609 i actually came here two years ago transferring from scoil triest the special needs school in glanmire because i have autism
4844610 im delighted with my results im hoping to do a course in computers in the national learning network im good at computers and there was a lot of it in the lca so i would like to move on from that a bit and get some qualifications
4844611 every case is individual but with autism its never over my advice to other parents is never say they cant do this or they cant do that the abilities are there you have to put 100 per cent also into the child you have to be there to support him when things do go wrong
4844612 i would say to people with children with autism going to mainstream just stick with it and open up and dont close in no matter what keep your supports open and just stick it it will all turn out fine in the end if you put the effort in
4844613 having considered the governments proposals for the establishment of a parliamentary commission fine gael believes that the role envisaged for such a body falls within the remit of the present oireachtas joint committee on european affairs
4844614 consequently i do not see any necessity to set up a new committee to deal with these important issues rather the existing european affairs committee should be asked to priorities these issues for the coming months
4844615 i am also open to discussing the expansion of the membership of the committee as has occurred with some other committees so that it includes representation from both sides of the lisbon treaty debate
4844616 the overwhelming evidence is that it the hijab is not an issue in schools

4844623 we were particularly surprised therefore that news of the proposed merger came during the negotiations for the second phase of the agreement
4844624 we do not understand how a merging of such important bodies can take place without any reference to the social partners and before the high level group on the implementation of the oecd report on public sector reform has even met
4844625 we are going to take every possible action with international support to oppose the ministers plan
4844626 gormleys plan is likely to cost the taxpayer another half a billion euro because once unesco inscribes the site it is very likely they will then require the m3 to moved like they did at stonehenge
4844627 we are going to take every possible action with international support to oppose the ministers plan
4844628 unesco have stated that they cannot act until minister gormley makes an official nomination and he is clearly waiting until the m3 is a fait accompli

4844656 to be the first person to enter a cave is a wonderful feeling like adrenaline i spend most of my free time together with my husband looking for caves
4844657 the most important thing in the cave is the depth to evaluate it we throw a stone into the hole and then wait to hear the stone reach the floor listen its about 8 meters deep
4844658 to discover new things not only caves you need three things to believe that it is possible to believe you are able to do it and to search with patience
4844659 the future of cave exploration lies in china today most of cave exploration in the world is in altitudes between 2000 3000 meters but in china there are now caves to explore at altitudes of about 5000 meters when i saw the pictures i realized that i must go there and find them

4844661 too often busy parents find themselves talking at their children but not to them and most especially not with them
4844662 share some of your own feelings and experiences with lifes challenges before you start asking them your children questions about their life knowing that you personally deal with fears anxieties doubts and related emotions gives your children permission to talk about those they are experiencing it makes them feel more okay about their own insecurities and it encourages them to talk more frankly with you about challenges they face in all facets of their life

4844677 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4844678 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels
4844679 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4844680 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4844681 we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team
4844682 absolutely its great to win a football match and to get three points on the table is fantastic early in the season
4844683 its our second game and three points and hopefully we can carry on next week
4844684 but we must analyse the game and take the positives and the negatives and learn and hopefully do better next week
4844685 well its in the history books now about a week already after the kilmarnock game and pre season meant nothing that is the time you prepare for the season
4844686 but the boys showed plenty positives out there today and created loads of chances and that is the main reason we won the game
4844687 their movement is opposite so i feel that is a partnership that gives us goals
4844688 today we saw plenty of efforts from fletcher although he didnt score he couldve scored two or three goals it wasnt to be hopefully hes saved some of his goals for next weekend

4844719 i have had enough of the lack of service and appalling conditions of heathrow in particular although gatwick has also significantly deteriorated
4844720 i fear they are going to say just sell gatwick

4844722 weve got to get georgia and the ukrainians into nato
4844723 what weve got now promising them future entry but not yet is the worst of all worlds it is a red rag to the russians and does nothing to protect these new allies
4844724 for the neocons this is the gift on a silver platter because it justifies their view of the world and provides reason to return to a policy of militarised containment of russia
4844725 there is a troubling sense that there is a longing to return to a world that is more black and white you would think we were in a new cold war
4844726 her entire career has been based on being nice to the russians and look wheres thats got us she was just like obama it was all hope and no experience
4844727 the us was giving mixed signals to saakashvili through private channels it was saying you have to behave but publicly it was portraying him as a knight in shining armour a beacon of freedom
4844728 there was an underestimation of the return of russian power and an under appreciation of how disgruntled russia was becoming
4844729 he bush wanted to stay in beijing there was little understanding of how serious this was
4844730 he thought he could talk to putin and sort it out that turned out to be wildly optimistic
4844731 in large companies a lot of people basically dont like each other and theyre competing you have to overcome all of that

4844744 but i understand why morgan tsvangirai and the mdc movement for democratic change cannot accept an agreement that fails to reflect the democratic will of the zimbabwean people

4844760 i knew if i went full gas they might pass me i put in every ounce of effort it was sheer hard work on my behalf and on behalf of the coaches i had to think about the finish like nothing else once i got there it was unbelievable
4844761 i thought athens was as good as it could get and after the world championships earlier this year so many teams were saying we were as good as we could be but we knew we had so much more to give
4844762 you can be friendly and relaxed but you have a switch in your head and when you swing your leg over the bike and youve got a number on your back it all changes

4844764 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm

4844766 will it bring remnant rainfall or will it be a hurricane at the coast
4844767 i can find no medical reason or problems that would preclude senator mccain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of president of the united states

4844769 i dont think we had our usual passing game but i think we controlled it without making too many chances and right on half time offiong robs the ball on the far touch line and still has a lot to do but uses his pace and ended it with a sensational strike
4844770 it was a great time to score a goal and we knew in the second half inverness would change and go 4 4 2 they did that by bringing on adam rooney their new singing and they pinned us back at times
4844771 we didnt create a lot but my two centre backs mark mclaughlin and christopher swailes were excellent
4844772 over the 90 minutes i think we deserved it we came here to try and win a football match and im a happy man
4844773 theres no fear factor at this football club the young guys are fearless and as a club and a manager we are trying to progress
4844774 the pitch didnt help us today it was so dry
4844775 the pitch last week compared to this week was night and day when there is a zip about the surface you can put balls about but it was so slow today saturday
4844776 we were the same as the pitch slow and laborious
4844777 if we want to win football games we have to be upbeat with a better tempo about things and want the ball a bit more
4844778 every single junket that weve done so far we always get the muse thing and when always say no its not that way its not that way and i dont think it is that way i think im fortunate enough to fit in to the young girl part of the story the young woman you know just the same as judy davis would fit in to a certain part or dianne weist would fit into a certain part

4844828 editorial pages around the country are weighing on the mccain campaigns hypocrisy on tax returns and transparency despite his efforts to craft an image as a champion of transparency in government senator mccain refuses to apply those standards of accountability and openness to himself in addition to releasing just two years of his own tax returns far less than any party nominee since ronald reagan in 1980 the mccain campaign is refusing to release mrs mccains tax returns even if she becomes first lady
4844829 as john mccains campaign continues its false and misleading attempts to spin away a widening lobbying scandal the usa today revealed that yet another member of mccains inner circle was lobbying on the campaign trail according to the report as recently as november 2007 mccains top foreign policy advisor randy scheunemann was lobbying mccains senate office on behalf of his foreign clients in the same week he was representing the senator on the campaign trail
4844830 despite his own campaigns ties to lobbyists nothing comes between barack obama and a partisan political attack
4844831 in senator obamas world lobbyists can raise money and advise his campaign on policy issues their families can contribute but supposedly they have no role its absurd despite his own rhetoric senator obama still refuses to disclose the list of lobbyists advising his campaign what is senator obama hiding
4844832 i cant understand why he would line up behind the president in opposition
4844833 it is typical but no less offensive that senator obama uses the senate floor to take cheap shots at an opponent and easy advantage of an issue he has less than zero understanding of
4844834 perhaps if senator obama would take the time and trouble to understand this issue he would learn to debate an honest disagreement respectfully but as he always does he prefers impugning the motives of his opponent and exploiting a thoughtful difference of opinion to advance his own ambitions if that is how he would behave as president the country would regret his election
4844835 i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did

4844844 let our wives die before they are abused and our children before they have tasted slavery and after we have slain them let us bestow that glorious benefit upon one another mutually and preserve ourselves in freedom

4844852 has attended more training camp practices as a new retiree one than he did in his final season as a player zero
4844853 but once camp starts its hard to find any time
4844854 because brett was off in the woods working on something
4844855 i think we can see the end of training camp getting pretty close
4844856 its almost over and the thought of playing games gets you sort of excited
4844857 but the cowboys can have the attention we like being the underdog and going under the radar i think it sort of draws the attention away from us and im fine with that
4844858 it makes you want to go out and earn it again
4844859 when everyones praising you all the time you start to believe it
4844860 i want to know why we werent more consistent last season
4844861 why did we have to wait for those last five games to play like that
4844862 i wanted to go somewhere where no one knew me
4844863 it just seemed really important to get away and relax after a long season
4844864 i put on a suit and we got her a nice outfit
4844865 ive been taking a lot of heat for it from the guys but it definitely earned me some bonus points at home
4844866 if you have a 12 play drive one thing can mess it up
4844867 if you hit on a deep ball every now and then it can cover up for some of those things
4844868 thats where you can improve and see what works missing one of your big players it can be hard
4844869 i guess they won their super bowl rings in training camp because they didnt win it last year
4844870 play the role of the underdog as well as anyone

4844872 we did it was a physical camp which i thought was important at the same time we were able to get everything in that we needed to get in you always have a plan for camp and you figure that there will be about three days that you are inside or have to cancel because of weather that kind of went as planned at the same time we were able to stay ahead and get everything that we needed to

4844891 the varying spam levels across states can be attributed to different socioeconomic factors and levels of security awareness in each state
4844892 the states that are experiencing higher spam levels may not place as high a priority on it security overall or employees and businesses may be more willing to share their personal contact information in public domains when email addresses are openly available spammers take advantage of it and inundate those inboxes with massive amounts of spam
4844893 not only are spam levels increasing we are also seeing several new and different types of spam
4844894 spam has become mailed out in smaller more targeted batches and spammers are using varying approaches from leveraging celebrity names and current events to grab attention to exploiting mainstream hosted services like microsoft skydrive and google docs to evade spam filters spammers are relentless in their tactics for exploiting computer users

4844905 well i didnt go to disney but i have been to the first barnies ever
4844906 interestingly the topographic features like the soil and vegetation of pohang korea and paradip orissa are very comparable the pohang project was successfully able to rehabilitate 67 000 residents from the project site this tremendous experience will be replicated in orissa as well the site near paradip is sandy like pohang korea it also has stretches of forest like pohang the latest estimate says that about 2 000 people of 400 households have to be relocated from the site for the orissa project whereas about 67 000 residents were rehabilitated for the project site in pohang
4844907 at least 500 people from the affected villages have migrated over three months either to other states such as maharashtra andhra pradesh and punjab or to other districts in orissa in search of livelihood
4844908 so far as land acquisition is concerned it is not desirable for a state government to get directly involved in the purchase of land for a private company unless there is an overwhelming public interest in doing so
4844909 the top priority of india must be provision of livelihood and if any concessions have to be given they should be linked to livelihood generation instead large businesses are being given great advantages solely on the ground of large capital and the equity market is the major criterion of health of the economy after gdp
4844910 i would encourage the foreign multinationals to add to the benefits that their commercial activity must generally speaking bring to orissa by also doing what is called corporate social responsibility it has now become a tradition for a couple of decades for the big firms to do something altruistic for the community in which they are situated for example building a playground giving funds to local primary schools for supplies aiding the destitute etc orissa authorities can surely suggest to the multinationals to do this allowing them the choice of programs that they would like to support many of us individuals do the same of course and i call it isr individual social responsibility thus speaking for myself i believe that my lifes work as a professor has been enormously helpful to the countless students i have trained but i still do isr giving away large sums of money to the local church near columbia university to support its program on helping the homeless rehabilitate themselves and to organizations such as cry in india
4844911 we are opposing the issuance of the noc to posco by the state pollution control board we also want to know on what basis the public hearing on the issue was held as majority of the people who will be affected by the project were not present during the hearing

4844914 we are not against fdi in the mining sector but the countrys mineral policy is faulty as it allows loot of our mineral wealth by foreign companies unless we challenge the countrys mineral policy we cannot fight the posco deal
4844915 the ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expressions of the dominant material relations the dominant material relations grasped as ideas hence of the relations which make the one class the ruling one therefore the ideas of its dominance
4844916 the existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class
4844917 as marxists we maintain that peaceful co existence does not include co existence between exploiters and exploited between oppressors and oppressed
4844918 for them the nation had to be constructed out of two elements the history of their struggles against colonialism and their program for the creation of justice the third world form of nationalism is thus better understood as an internationalist nationalism
4844919 peoples come from the shores of the ganges and the nile the yangtse and the niger nations of the vast pacific waters greetings on this historic occasion it is my profound conviction that the very fact of the convening of the conference of asian and african nations at bandung indonesia in itself will be recorded as an historic turning point in all world affairs
4844920 indeed the fact that the asian and african nations possessing similar yet different cultures have come together to solve their common problems must stand as a shining example to the rest of the world
4844921 a format for what would eventually become afro asian and then afro asian latin american group in the un
4844922 roots of the third world intellectuals quandary was how to create a new self in the new nations
4844923 new leadership led by khrushchev and bulganin adopted peaceful co existence and pledged their support to the bourgeois nationalist regimes often against the domestic communists the unclear situation suggested that the ussr seemed keener to push its own national interests than those of the national communist parties to which it pledged verbal fealty
4844924 had an attitude toward the former colonies that in some ways mimicked that of the first world
4844925 political independence nonviolent international relations and the cultivation of the un as the principle institution for planetary justice
4844926 what about the two thirds who remained outside the east west circles what of those 2 billion people
4844927 the main problem with the arusha tanu project however came not in its goals but in its implementation
4844928 the abandonment of economic sovereignty lost the national liberation regimes one of their two principal pillars of legitimacy when imf led globalization became the modus operandi the elites of the postcolonial world adopted a hidebound and ruthless xenophobia that masqueraded as patriotism
4844929 the mecca of imf driven globalization is therefore in the ability to open ones economy to stateless soulless corporations while blaming the failure of well being on religious ethnic sexual and other minorities that is the mecca of the post third world era
4844930 the third world today faces europe like a colossal mass whose project should be to try to resolve the problems to which europe has not been able to find the answers
4844931 from the early 1960s to the late 1970s the rhetorical denunciation of imperialism reached its apogee even as the third world began to lose its voice
4844932 colonialism denies human rights to people it has subjugated by violence and whom it keeps in poverty and ignorance by force therefore as marx would say in a state of sub humanity
4844933 armed struggle not only as a tactic of anticolonialism but significantly as a strategy in itself
4844934 mother teresa would soon get more positive airtime as the white savior of the dark hordes than would the self directed projects of the third world nationalist governments
4844935 the third world was not a place it was a project
4844936 the phrase east west conflict distorts the history of the cold war because it makes it seem as if the first and second worlds confronted each other in a condition of equality
4844937 the dominant classes in the first world used the shortages and repression in the ussr as an instructive tool to wield over the heads of their own working class and so on both economic and political grounds the first world bore advantages over the second
4844938 petty bourgeois nationalism proclaims as internationalism the mere recognition of the equality of nations and nothing more quite apart from the fact that this recognition is purely verbal petty bourgeois nationalism preserves national self interest intact whereas proletarian internationalism demands first that the interests of the proletarian struggle in any one country should be subordinated to the interests of that struggle on a world wide scale and second that a nation which is achieving victory over the bourgeoisie should be able and willing to make the greatest national sacrifices for the overthrow of international capital

4845161 amd has a proven track record of collaboration with the software eco system to support the needs of the open source community
4845162 with this announcement were demonstrating our commitment to respond to the needs of the open source community and adopt a consistent approach across cpu and gpu technologies by supporting open source drivers on our industry leading ati radeon graphics processors we accelerate innovation across the entire amd platform
4845163 the lack of open source drivers for graphics hardware has long been a major obstacle for linux developers and linux desktop users
4845164 our ultimate goal is complete high quality open source drivers for all video hardware todays announcement brings us one major step closer novell is pleased to have extended our collaboration with amd to deliver the initial drivers that will allow open source developers to make the linux experience even better on desktops laptops and workstations and we look forward to contributing this initial code to x org
4845165 amd announced its intention to extend support of open source ati drivers at red hats summit conference in may of this year so we are delighted that the work necessary to achieve this has come to fruition
4845166 this action affirms amds commitment to linux and the open source community and will greatly improve the

4845169 its panels pivot from east to west to follow the sun over the course of a day not west to east
4845170 shut up about fisa warrantless surveillance domestic spying already its over
4845171 the type of degree you have hardly ever matters just as long as you have a degree of some kind
4845172 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4845173 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4845174 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4845175 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4845176 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4845177 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4845178 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4845179 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4845180 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4845181 will the alternative solve the problem as defined by the desired end state and end state goals
4845182 youve got to utilize your human resources much more efficiently today if youre going to stay on top of it thats why everyone is heading toward the team concept
4845183 when a project requires brain power teams are much more efficient
4845184 the beauty about global teams is that theyre reaching for the next stage
4845185 i think corporations as weve known them have actually run their course and are beginning to break into autonomous business units so the decisions are in the hands of the people carrying out the work global teams are one way of cross pollinating they move people who are successful in one branch of the organization to work with people in another country and another branch of the organization
4845186 its a program of both learning and teaching that enhances the ability and taps into the creativity of all people in an organization
4845187 during this phase people begin to truly work together they learn day by day how to negotiate team milestones develop reporting procedures and meet deadlines the real challenge is to find something that works for everybody it might not be exactly what everybody wants but it allows the team to accomplish its goals in a collaboration that works
4845188 you can teach technical skills more easily than you can change a personality or develop a good communicator
4845189 one of our goals is to determine how hr can support and accelerate the business objectives of the organization
4845190 part of that is through dovetailing our strategic plan with the businesss strategic plan and translating that to establish the foundation of a human resources group to hire and develop people i cant do it by myself i need to utilize other team members and sometimes to leverage resources
4845191 when i can talk with people in a similar situation from different parts of the world im not reinventing the wheel im gaining leverage from their experience
4845192 allergan is quite a global company more than half our sales come from countries other than the united states
4845193 international business people know they have to understand countries around the world we have training on communications skills diversity different cultures bringing people together in a team always takes more time than having those same people work on their own but it pays back later on when you have a development plan or alaunch plan that fits global needs not just the needs of one or two countries
4845194 one of the most important discoveries we made is that teams need very simple basic processes and procedures
4845195 its very important to set clear expectations and to have clearly defined goals roles and responsibilities
4845196 the intel culture is the glue of global teams its the umbrella that enables them to get their work done by always providing a point of reference
4845197 for the team to be effective the members had to really identify and harness the different cultural strengths and what contributions each member could make to the team
4845198 if youve had early face to face meetings then youve established a ground work to move from and its easier to work with the remote technologies to accomplish a task
4845199 this is the time to develop the groups charter to project milestones and critical success factors
4845200 if the technology isnt there if team members dont have groupware so they can share documents or e mail and videoconferencing capabilities so they can communicate rapid fire people will find it a physical bar tier i think employees become frustrated when theyre asked to work together but encounter some delay based on technology
4845201 although the logistics are more difficult its rewarding to be part of a global team
4845202 its really a learning experience you get exposed to other ways of thinking and problem solving other ways of proceeding and when you are working on a big project you get the opportunity to develop several lasting long distance relationships
4845203 its only through their people that companies are going to take the customers breath away and give added value to the customer beyond what their competition offers
4845204 businesses cant stand still theyve got to be continually working on this and fine tuning it to stay ahead
4845205 using anti depressants increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior among young people
4845206 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4845207 but you must remember my fellow citizens that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing it behooves you therefore to be watchful in your states as well as in the federal government
4845208 the two enemies of the people are criminals and government so let us tie the second down with the chains of the constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first
4845209 the trade off between freedom and security so often proposed so seductively very often leads to the loss of both
4845210 the united states was supposed to have a limited government because the founders knew governmental power attracts swarms of crooks demagogues and despots as surely as horse manure attracts swarms of horseflies
4845211 were dealing with the oldest political error the belief that because everyone wants something government should or must provide it if the error is pervasive the result is the total state if it is completely uprooted the result is the purely free society
4845212 the government is merely a servant merely a temporary servant it cannot be its prerogative to determine what is right and what is wrong and decide who is a patriot and who isnt its function is to obey orders not originate them
4845213 in the end more than they wanted freedom they wanted security they wanted a comfortable life and they lost it all security comfort and freedom when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility then athens ceased to be free
4845214 if a nation values anything more than freedom it will lose its freedom and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more it will lose that too
4845215 it is not for glory or riches or honours that we fight but only for liberty which no good man will consent to lose but with his life
4845216 for those looking for security be forewarned that theres nothing more insecure than a political promise
4845217 the romans used to say that courage is not the only virtue but its the only one that makes the other virtues possible
4845218 a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government
4845219 its over 90 degrees the ground is too dry and hard to dig and were leaving for a vacation trip tomorrow anyway
4845220 the devil is a better theologian than any of us and is a devil still
4845221 for such men are false apostles deceitful workers masquerading as apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light it is not surprising then if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness their end will be what they deserve
4845222 how have you fallen from heaven o morning star son of the dawn
4845223 all this i will give you if you will bow down and worship me
4845224 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
4845225 so that no advantage would be taken of us by satan for we are not ignorant of his schemes
4845226 satan seeks to distract us by getting us to focus our attention on the material instead of the spiritual on methods rather than the message on men rather than god he will get us to major on the minors and to minimize the majors
4845227 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
4845228 it was a 99 degree september day in san antonio when a woman accidentally locked her 10 month old baby niece inside a parked car
4845229 the lady was mad at me because i broke the window i just thought whats more important the baby or the window
4845230 set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
4845231 whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakim there
4845232 have some of your carefully created castles been washed away mine have several times along my lifes journey i had nowhere to turn except into my heavenly fathers arms there i remained quiet soaking up his love for as long as i needed then i saw his hand begin a new creation for my life a new direction a new service for him and his kingdom waves need not always destroy we must allow our heavenly father to use them to redirect our lives
4845233 if you expect perfection from people your whole life is a series of disappointments grumblings and complaints if on the contrary you pitch your expectations low taking folks as the inefficient creatures which they are you are frequently surprised by having them perform better than you had hoped
4845234 and the people spoke against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loathes this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died
4845235 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer
4845236 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you
4845237 the secret of every discord in christian homes and communities and churches is that we seek our own way and our own glory
4845238 it is too bad that anything so obvious should need to be said at this late date but from all appearances we christians have about forgotten the lesson so carefully taught by paul gods servants are not to be competitors but co workers
4845239 only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel
4845240 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching
4845241 we pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital
4845242 i cant see that hillary would appeal to feminists because why is she there
4845243 good maybe then they will at least lay down on the turf in the stadium and look at the stars
4845244 despite his many accomplishments as a television producer it was sievers writing about his battle with colon cancer that many of his colleagues and friends believe is his greatest legacy
4845245 after years of covering major disastsers when hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast sievers found himself unable to simply watch the events unfold on television so he volunteered with the red cross and spent weeks delivering food and aid in louisiana

4845251 his fastball velocity is ready but we have to work on the command of that pitch and certainly his secondary pitches
4845252 whether hes ready or not thats to be determined we are in a pennant race and its very difficult to dip down to the double a thing but weve done it before with wilson alvarez mark buehrle
4845253 the bottom line is we have a lot of possibilities but to tell you the truth nothing has been discussed in depth yet
4845254 we have to play each game one at a time as corny as that sounds we are trying to win todays game and go from there
4845255 lets just say you move him from high a to double a or from double a to triple a
4845256 if a guy is mentally tough and he goes out there and doesnt do well its not going to be like he thinks he stinks and you lose him forever
4845257 when a guy is mentally tough its a lesser risk to ever move him im open to anything weve got options and we will figure them out and go from there

4845261 should in no way limit or put in danger freedom of movement and travel along the road and rail axes of georgia
4845262 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4845263 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4845264 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4845265 i dont think theres a great overlap in the audiences for bond and potter
4845266 theyre different films aimed at different markets so i dont see them as competitors or rivals
4845267 you want to put your biggest releases on as many screens as possible
4845268 if there is a scenario where theyre being hogged by a film that is lingering around why not wait

4845272 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4845273 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4845274 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4845275 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4845276 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4845277 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4845278 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4845279 i am diligently and delicately working to do everything possible to amend this tragic family situation as a father my only goal is to get my daughter back home i appreciate your continued support and understanding in this desperate hour
4845280 in view of the substance and significance of the fundamental constitutional right to form a family relationship the california constitution properly must be interpreted to guarantee this basic civil right to all californians whether gay or heterosexual and to same sex couples as well as to opposite sex couples
4845281 its a throwaway line but i think its true as california goes so goes the rest of the nation
4845282 it is with a tremendous sense of gratitude and relief that i have successfully completed my course of therapy at the university of chicago
4845283 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy

4845288 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4845289 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4845290 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4845291 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4845292 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4845293 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4845294 we knew we had a good motorcycle today capable of running some pretty good lap times if we needed to its funny after qualifying i said to crew chief pete doyle i left a couple tenths out there and it looks like i found at least one of them today in the start of the race so it was a good race for us good to get another win and hopefully we can get another one tomorrow
4845295 i was just trying to latch on the back of mat and go and kind of lost the rear a little bit and couldnt quite get back into a rhythm quick enough i knew we were in trouble i thought we had some decent pace and just when i saw the gap come down as quick as it did i knew we were kind of in trouble and i was just going to try to see if we could hang onto him when he came by i just had a bit of a moment and chilled out a little bit and got everything back together and got second i could see that we had a pretty big gap on third so there wasnt a need to do anything silly because i definitely didnt have the speed today to win
4845296 completing a final standard by mid 2011 will be extremely difficult perhaps impossible
4845297 totally solvent theres not an issue bear is not in trouble i want to make that point vociferously

4845300 if one wanted to get a letter to a relative or friend in another colony he waited for a ship captain or a traveler passing through perhaps a merchant sending a package or a cargo of goods sometimes if it were urgent one employed a friendly native american to deliver a letter for him
4845301 the show has been criticized people complained about the poor storylines but the writers have hardly any time to work with the characters they were just getting used to them
4845302 why is he so obsessed with a show that we dont even remember
4845303 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4845304 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4845305 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4845306 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4845307 it is not at all unusual for both parties in large negotiations like ours to meet in smaller more manageable groups to talk about remaining outstanding issues in an effort to reach accord
4845308 claims by sags negotiators about informal talks are no more true today than they were when first made two weeks ago
4845309 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 2008 and no meetings are scheduled
4845310 the undisputed fact is that until sags negotiators make a deal their members will work indefinitely under an expired contract enjoying none of the pay increases protections or new media residuals that all of the other guilds are receiving

4845316 it may be objected that by ruining our colonies killing one half the people and driving the rest over the mountains we may deprive ourselves of their custom for our manufactured goods but a moments consideration will satisfy us that since we have lost so much of our european trade it can be only the demand in america that keeps up and has of late so greatly enhanced the price of those goods and therefore a stop put to that demand will be an advantage to all of us as we may thereafter buy our own goods cheaper
4845317 multitudes of our own poor may starve for want of employment

4845319 rules by which a great empire may be reduced to a small one
4845320 in the first place gentlemen you are to consider that a great empire like a great cake is most easily diminished at the edges
4845321 take special care the provinces are never incorporated with the mother country that they do not enjoy the same common rights the same privileges in commerce and that they are governed by severer laws all of your enacting without allowing them any share in the choice of legislators
4845322 however peaceably your colonies have submitted to your government shown their affection to your interest and patiently borne their grievances you are to suppose them always inclined to revolt and treat them accordingly quarter troops among them who by their insolence may provoke the rising of mobs you may in time convert your suspicions into realities
4845323 whenever the injured come to the capital with complaints punish such suitors with long delay enormous expense and a final judgment in favor of the oppressor
4845324 resolve to harass them with novel taxes they will probably complain to your parliament that they are taxed by a body in which they have no representative and that this is contrary to common right let the parliament flout their claims and treat the petitioners with utmost contempt
4845325 that a revenue should be raised from said colonies in britain
4845326 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4845327 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4845328 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
4845329 if we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the yahoo board

4845337 he was an icon for the tuskegee airmen atlanta chapter
4845338 it was the first time in aviation history that black american pilots of the u s army air corps engaged aircraft in combat
4845339 we dared not fail because the white folks could say see we knew they couldnt do it
4845340 can you believe that these were enemies from germany on that base who had less restrictions than blacks that was very painful
4845341 he hoped to have a career as a commercial pilot but because of discrimination he was unable to be hired
4845342 we had the feeling that wherever we went whatever our skills were weve got to be no 1
4845343 that was our main obstacle we had to overcome the irony is that we turned out to be the best the air force had in terms of fighter escort
4845344 t he misconception is that the housing crisis is just a crisis around people who took loans
4845345 on one level that is clearly where the bomb directly hit in that there are tons of people who are losing their homes through foreclosures but the ripple effect of the entire credit crisis is actually much bigger than that
4845346 so the banks then are either trying to get rid of those buildings or hold on to them at the least cost until they can get rid of them
4845347 the most homes in foreclosure are in zip codes that didnt exist five years ago
4845348 all the estimates are that blacks and hispanics will be hurt much more by the decline in housing fairly significantly
4845349 the subprime mortgage crisis will cause african americans to experience wealth losses of between 72 billion and 93 billion over its duration for people of color in general the racial bias of subprime mortgage lenders accounts for nearly double the wealth losses for people of color as for whites
4845350 women are more likely to receive subprime mortgages of all types regardless of income
4845351 upper income african american women are nearly five times more likely to receive subprime purchase mortgages than upper income white men and upper income latino women are nearly four times more likely to receive subprime loans than upper income white men black women as always were the last people into the musical chair game
4845352 and then the chair was swept out from under them
4845353 consequently they bought whatever they felt like buying whatever looked good it was really like the wild wild west
4845354 j ust given that there were large pockets of people of color who just didnt understand how the process worked they were a ready made set of pawns to be used and to be taken advantage of in many cases by brokers who moved into these areas that didnt have banks or credit unions and set up their shops there they were the only game in town so if you wanted a mortgage and walked through their doors no matter what type of credit score you might have had even if you qualified for prime you werent going to get that because the only thing these shops knew how to do was subprime mortgages
4845355 a person who buys a security that s backed by a pool of mortgages does not have any liability once the underlying mortgages go belly up
4845356 the big five investment banks are projected to pay out 38 billion in bonuses this year 2007 even more than last year
4845357 we couldnt get a jobs program to dig ditches and kind of help working class people out
4845358 were about to give 3 billion to developers to dig a tunnel
4845359 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party because we just give more opportunity to folks who are hardworking people who are immigrants and come from members of minority groups
4845360 that would be cool if it was in rock band
4845361 if you would persuade appeal to interest and not to reason
4845362 how will employees respond to getting a lottery ticket that gives them a definite amount instead of one that could amount to nothing or a ridiculous sum

4845371 thats it theres the door f off if you cant stay with soldier yet than thats your problem but i want you gone now
4845372 you cant convince a believer of anything for their belief is not based on evidence its based on a deep seated need to believe
4845373 is it possible to speak to someone who can tell me how a patient is doing
4845374 ill be glad to help dear whats the name and room number

4845379 nabj will hold you accountable if you do not consider diversity in your hiring and particularly firing practices
4845380 the blogosphere is like the real world in many ways
4845381 some of the same obstacles challenges and inequalities that exist in the real world exist in the blogosphere too
4845382 its an open medium anyone can participate and in fact 95 percent of the time we have no idea if a participant at dailykos is white black brown female male gay straight left handed right handed or ambidextrous
4845383 how many of us can afford to sleep on someones couch and survive on cheetos for five years while youre working on your blog building it up
4845384 after a lot of black bloggers i know complained that they werent included in some other big blog conventions
4845385 well some folks that i know said that they felt shut out of the yearlykos conference and even the blogher meeting
4845386 so i thought well the solution to that is simple we need to hold our own conference
4845387 i had been involved in community activism since high school and by the time i finished my undergraduate studies i was burned out
4845388 im not from the old school civil rights industrial complex and it seemed to me that the internet was a good fit
4845389 the big blogs had made note of the fox cbc situation they saw the problem that fox was malevolent toward blacks but only after they saw us making a case around the racial aspect did they also say yeah you know this is horrible
4845390 there was a certain kind of bridge building that happened
4845391 one third of all movie goers in this country are black and yet african americans have no real power in hollywood either there is a commitment to leveraging institutional power and individual behavior around involving people of color in politically compatible ways online or bloggers of color must develop well resourced entities that do for these communities what predominantly white ones have not
4845392 i know a lot of bloggers like to complain about the so called msm and at first i did too
4845393 but i know we have a lot to learn from journalists about journalistic principles i think we have things to teach them and that they have things to teach us too
4845394 i feel like the issue may more be that the doctors are treating all the patients the same and if you treat all the patients the same you wont get the same outcomes because patients dont face the same challenges
4845395 were not tailoring our counseling to the needs of our patients
4845396 a day of blogging for justice blogging against extra judicial electrocution
4845397 now is the time to take this case to the grand jury for a determination about whether charges should be brought
4845398 i know there are strong feelings on both sides of this matter but my obligation and that of the grand jury is to objectively sort through the facts and make a decision that is in the best interest of justice that is what we intend to do
4845399 where it is deemed reasonably necessary to control a dangerous or violent subject
4845400 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4845401 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4845402 ne sle u ni na sur in ni na batajnicu ve tu negde
4845403 today i am proudest of the fact that despite a long hard period on several fronts a time we might look back on as our winter of discontent it is clear our institution remains focused on our mission vision and values and moving toward our goal of being the best public regional university in the south
4845404 this project will be a turning point in the history of our institution and community and i believe it will change the face of medicine and medical education in east kentucky
4845405 weve been an institution of opportunity for 121 years and that will not change on my watch
4845406 perhaps our greatest achievement in this difficult budgeting process was the 1 000 base salary increase for full time faculty and staff members and the 50 cent increase for hourly employees
4845407 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you
4845408 daleko je septembar hocemo lako cemo moze u grcku cemo zajedno podrazumeva se
4845409 most classic brand managers look at technology with a deep rooted aversion fear loathing dismay anger denial future shock
4845410 you have to keep the consumer in mind and use technology to do that
4845411 ive never been to an igloo with a basketball hoop which is pretty great
4845412 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4845413 tim you have no standing to ask me that question about denouncing farrakhan as long as nbc continues to employ hate mongerering commentators like pat buchanan in fact cnn has no standing as long as it continues to validate the bigotry of commentator bill bennett
4845414 gutter religion farrakhan said that really i never heard that when and where did he say that id really like to see the transcript or video of that speech
4845415 on what basis should a candidate denounce the support from an individual organization or country what is the criterion one offensive comment one alleged offensive comment and to what extent is that offense mitigated over time or substantive acts of good faith and or positive contributions to society
4845416 i want a sunday kind of love a love to last past saturday night
4845417 see al sharpton jesse jackson and the like will be put out of business now the country will vote for a black candidate were beyond race
4845418 shall endeavor to conduct joint projects enhance training of technical personnel and foster private sector cooperative agreements
4845419 i pray to linda i pray for her soul every day
4845420 i also pray that one day you and your family will be forgiving also im so sorry
4845421 we want to have a full range of actions we have listings there is the tro there is the possibility of no lifting of the tro that will be one of the range of actions that we have the sc is still sorting out the order nothing is final yet
4845422 so far nothing that is contrary to the provisions of the constitutions has cropped up
4845423 the constitution allows the revision of the law itself we can aptly ask congress to do that but there is a strong probability that the sc will lift the tro
4845424 we will just have to wait but im optimistic that the supreme court will lift the tro
4845425 let us not play around with peace the alternative to peace is war
4845426 it is best that everyone christians muslims lumad government officials politicians leaders of civil society congress and those in the judiciary must all treat the pending issue with sobriety and circumspection and with abiding resolve that all must contribute to install peace in the land
4845427 the issue is now with the supreme court lets wait for its ruling and all will have to submit to it when it comes the highest tribunal is the final arbiter it will rise above the din and noise created by less noble considerations
4845428 when peace comes development follows this is not only for mindanao we are at the threshold of a breakthrough that will hopefully solve generations old unsettled grievances and issues
4845429 lets not miss this rare opportunity of finding peace in the land
4845430 playing with peace stories as if they are political chattels where sound bites or catchy headlines make their day
4845431 was speculatively headlined a move to renegotiate with the milf
4845432 this is at the least provocative and may be viewed in a negative light by the milf leadership with whom the government has long nurtured the paradigms of peace
4845433 we wish media will become partners not just impartial chroniclers at worst critics of the peace efforts
4845434 we must all rise above fleeting headline considerations a miscue can put to waste years of patient work of negotiations bringing us now so close to a mutually acceptable peace settlement
4845435 i believe our point was well articulated at the start of the oral argument in the supreme court but we cannot just stop and let our guard down i urged the people in many affected areas to continue to stay vigilant
4845436 i can only speculate that we have reached this point sc discussing the moa ad because of the secrecy the grp panel has made in offering many areas in mindanao without proper consultation with the affected areas and with the country as a whole
4845437 what we want to do is to prevent harm to come to our way
4845438 i am saying that there are politicians who are using the moa for their political interests there are senators who are riding on the issue at the expense of peace in mindanao even the opposition in congress is riding on the issue because they want to remove president arroyo from power so this is affecting the peaceful resolution of the problem
4845439 one of the key reasons why the armm is a failure is the fact that majority of the people do not trust the armm they do not see it as a solution to their problem and so they dont cooperate
4845440 in elections they dont care who wins and rightfully so because if you look at the lives of the bangsamoro people the poor remained poor
4845441 once again the hard work of our health workers is paying off and i wish to commend their relentless efforts and dedication to ease the health burden of our people
4845442 this show of support and commendation from the public and many development partners serves as an impetus for the department to do better in our reforms in financing regulations health service delivery and good governance we have initiated since 2005
4845443 thinking about your touch makes me lose my ground i want to be in your arms again holding hands and never leave but all i can do is dream about you and me in never land but all it is is a fantasy although its heavenly its a teenage dream all wrapped in pink and dotted with hearts
4845444 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
4845445 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
4845446 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous there is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god within us and as we let our light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
4845447 sangat senang kemenangan ini hasil kerjasama tim kedua gol ini saya persembahkan untuk bobotoh dan ketua umum persib pak dada yang kemarin sukses terpilih kembali jadi wali kota bandung
4845448 itu kado istimewa bagi saya kemenangan ini menjadi kado bagi kedua bagi saya kado pertama bagi saya adalah ketika persib menang atas persik di solo jadi sebelum dan sesudah pilkada saya mendapat kado istimewa
4845449 this is an irregular undisciplined chaotic angry humiliated georgian force they dont listen to orders they fire on civilians from what we have just seen
4845450 i have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on
4845451 senator obamas support among working hard working americans white americans is weakening again and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me theres a pattern emerging here
4845452 this was on top of democratic strategist and clinton supporter paul begala saying this week on cnn
4845453 we cannot win with eggheads and african americans ok thats the dukakis coalition which carried 10 states and gave us four years of the first george bush president clinton you know reached across and got a whole lot of republicans and independents to come
4845454 barack obama has shown he cannot get the votes that democrats need to win blue collar working people he can get effete snobs he can get wealthy academics and he can get the young he can get the black vote thats about it
4845455 we cannot win with the working class and white people ok thats the reagan coalition
4845456 so let us say that on this day of all days each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds
4845457 the american negro problem is a problem in the heart of the american it is there that the interracial tension has its focus it is there that the decisive struggle goes on
4845458 but if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators
4845459 blacks could play a far more decisive role though if their political leaders felt threatened enough to pursue tougher immigration policies actively
4845460 some republicans have positions on immigration that would resonate in the black community but only a few have tried to take advantage of black anger of immigration
4845461 communications and research foundation supportive of a strong national defense and dedicated to providing free market solutions to todays public policy problems
4845462 the strategic philanthropy of onservative foundations moving a public policy agenda
4845463 the feeding trough the bradley foundation the bell curve amp the real story behind w 2 wisconsins national model for welfare reform
4845464 i was getting ready for school getting dressed when i heard this noise i thought it was my mother coming back
4845465 some people were slamming car doors outside the trailer i heard footsteps and then a loud boom and then somebody screaming asking if we were illegals mexicans these big men were standing in my living room holding guns one man blocked my doorway another guy grabbed a gun on his side i freaked out oh my god i yelled
4845466 this weekend alone we received more than 200 phone calls from people telling horrible stories of arrests
4845467 there are hundreds of latinos whove been hunted down like animals taken to jail and they dont even know why or whether or not theyll be released
4845468 will benefit citizens of georgia and the citizens of mexico and other latin american countries
4845469 with its attractive quality of life and rapidly expanding job market metro atlanta draws thousands of newcomers every year and has growing latin asian and african american communities
4845470 it is in the spirit of peace it is in the spirit of collaboration and it is in the spirit of fairness that we attack this issue of economic competitiveness
4845471 they couldnt ride in the same trains they couldnt drink from the same fountains
4845472 i felt mad when i read about that even though they werent my people
4845473 its hard to describe what it feels like to be illegal here in georgia its like you cant move
4845474 it feels scary because you know that when you go out to a public place you might never know if youre going to come back im really scared because my mother drives without a license shes scared too
4845475 but when i was in seventh grade i went to richards middle school where it wasnt the white people saying things it was black people they didnt like mexican kids they would call us mexican border hoppers wetbacks and all these things every time theyd see me they yelled at me threatened to beat me up after school for no reason at all
4845476 its like now since they have rights they can discriminate against others
4845477 im caught between african americans who dont want to understand immigration and immigrants and latinos who use words like moreno negritos los negros and other terms that are not good
4845478 we need to move from civil rights to human rights we need to start using the language and tools of human rights around the issue of immigration its an international issue that needs an international framework
4845479 some civil rights leaders here dont think human rights affects us in the united states
4845480 a lot of the civil rights elders of that movement are not linked to the human rights movement and that also gets in the way of working together
4845481 weve globalized money weve globalized trade and commerce but we havent globalized fairness toward work and labor the solution to the problem of immigration and other problems is globalization of justice
4845482 there are many differences between our experience and that of immigrant latinos but there is a family resemblance between jim crow and what is being experienced by immigrants both met economic oppression both met racial and ethnic hostility
4845483 paris is determined to make a go of this club shes investing a lot of her own money into the project and believes she can make a go of it by roping in all her celeb pals to check it out
4845484 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm

4845489 on orders of dotc secretary leandro mendoza we will revisit the presidential order on protocol plates the review is not limited to the members of the house of representatives it covers all from the president down to the rtc judges
4845490 violation of this prohibition shall be sufficient ground or cause for the revocation of the granted privilege and the confiscation of the issued protocol plate and imposition of corresponding penalty for the violations committed as provided by existing laws
4845491 this goes to show how the people appreciate and recognize the performance of the pnp in providing law enforcement and public safety services to the communities
4845492 this can only mean that there is more room for improvement in the organization
4845493 through better performance and quality of public service we hope to sway and convince the undecided respondents and get their approval
4845494 we also received the reappointment papers of 44 other senior military officers two major generals five brigadier generals two commodores 29 colonels and six naval captains
4845495 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4845496 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4845497 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4845498 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4845499 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4845500 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4845501 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4845502 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4845503 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4845504 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4845505 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4845506 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4845507 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4845508 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4845509 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4845510 sometimes i look out my office windows and i can almost see the ghosts of the workers and buildings that were here for so many years
4845511 its often hard to believe that weve come this far
4845512 the true tragedy of anakin is that hes kind of a pale reflection of the truly great tragic heroes
4845513 a minor change to the api that should have a major impact on the twitter community
4845514 r ace is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
4845515 most working and middle class white americans do not feel that they have been privileged by their race t hey feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense
4845516 suncrest if you are not going to buy anything head out to the van now if you want to buy something you need to be in line by now if you do not get in line soon you will not be allowed to make a purchase
4845517 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4845518 its safer to go around nightwalkers than to go through them
4845519 i wish i had as much time on my hands
4845520 i was looking at my birth certificate it has an expiration date
4845521 it was those who loved him most who died young he was a rock they broke themselves against however much he tried to protect them
4845522 some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness and they live by what they hear such people become crazy but they become legends
4845523 the only time i got to rock was in my grannys chair
4845524 aaah i lost an arm oooh liquids dead i might as well take this
4845525 fuck big shell fuck that fat guy with the skates fuck solidus fuck this shit
4845526 we have a new client and they need a dancing chicken campaign executed for a monday morning presentation
4845527 well i saw on fill in the media outlet name here that you had a chest freezer for sale can i take a look at it
4845528 everyone has paid for the person in back of them
4845529 i knew this would happen somebody would have a really big order
4845530 i walked around the corner from the hallway and saw a tall man reach toward his gun and look straight at me
4845531 we target egregious employers those who have built their business model on hiring an illegal workforce
4845532 this practice undercuts legal law abiding companies and can create an environment where employee welfare and labor standards are not enforced
4845533 he is the last living person to have performed with duke ellington at new yorks legendary cotton club he played with apollo theater in 1934 the year it opened its doors to black customers he played with louis armstrong for several years and was the best man at his wedding
4845534 despite significant drug and asset seizures and drug related convictions in recent years drug markets have proven to be extremely resilient they are highly fluid and adapt effectively to government and law enforcement interventions
4845535 while the availability of controlled drugs is restricted by definition it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
4845536 this is nothing new weve known that prohibition measures havent worked for 20 years but the situation is actually worse than the report suggests it is the measures of prohibition that have caused drugs problems and pushed the trade into the hands of organised crime and street corner dealers
4845537 this is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug related harm
4845538 of course drug dealers must be brought to justice but we should recognise and encourage the wider role that the police and other law enforcement officials can play in reducing the impact of drug markets on our communities
4845539 arming the northern alliance to go on the offensive against the taliban and pressing the cia to go after bin laden and the al qaeda leadership
4845540 before the snows start falling in afghanistan by the middle of october at the latest
4845541 you dont mind if your top player is in control its when your mediocre player is in control
4845542 im not talking about any player in particular im just talking about the state of the game in general a contracts a contract therefore it should be worth something
4845543 in my day the players had no power whatsoever and you always felt you were hard done by and that no one was there to support you in our day we yearned for a halfway house but now it has gone miles in the other direction
4845544 maybe im not being realistic but i dont believe it should be an impossibility players are driven into this idea that the champions league is the be all and end all of everything
4845545 it isnt really you know its a great competition but it isnt everything
4845546 there wasnt one person at villa myself the chairman especially the fans who would have wanted to see gareth leave and go to liverpool or anywhere else
4845547 but the minute he made it known he wanted to go to liverpool i really couldnt do very much about it and thats where you talk about the powerlessness you feel
4845548 at forest we won the european cup twice and those days were fantastic but it was the league competition the 42 matches we played in that that was everything thats what you lived for every single saturday
4845549 it will be difficult but as a football club were going to have to find some way to be able to do it
4845550 villa have won the european cup and that is what i want to aspire to
4845551 so what its a 2 beverage thats like what 30 or 40 cents to me
4845552 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4845553 attune their ears and open their hearts to the anguish of a people who were lonely frightened and powerless
4845554 the science of linguistics has brought into view new horizons in the understanding of human communications an objective study of the ways in which meanings are transmitted has shown that much more is relayed from one man to another through and in silence than in words words and sentences are composed of silences more meaningful than the sounds the pregnant pauses between sounds and utterances become luminous points in an incredible void as electrons in the atom as planets in the solar system language is as a cord of silence with sounds the knots as nodes in a peruvian quipu in which the empty spaces speak
4845555 it is thus not so much the other mans words as his silences which we have to learn in order to understand him it is not so much our sounds which give meaning but it is through the pauses that we will make ourselves understood the learning of a language is more the learning of its silences than of its sounds
4845556 it is the silence which closes man in on himself to allow him to prepare the word for others the silence in which we await the right moment for the word to be born into the world this silence too is threatened not only by hurry and by desecration of multiplicity of action but by the habit of verbal confection and mass production that has no time for it it is threatened by the silence of cheapness which means that one word is as good as another and that words need no nursing this is a silence before words or between them the silence within which words live and die
4845557 the silence that does not prepare any further talk it is the silence which has said everything because there is nothing more to say this is the silence beyond a final yes or a final no this is the silence of love beyond words as well as the silence of no forever the silence of heaven or of hell
4845558 there is still another silence beyond words the silence of the piet it is not a silence of death but a silence of the mystery of death it is not the silence of active acceptance of the will of god out of which the fiat is born nor the silence of manly acceptance of gethsemane in which obedience has its roots the silence you as missioners seek to acquire in this spanish course is the silence beyond bewilderment and questions it is a silence beyond the possibility of an answer or even reference to a word which preceded it is the mysterious silence through which the lord could descend into the silence of hell the acceptance without frustration of a life useless and wasted on judas a silence of freely willed powerlessness through which the world was saved born to redeem the world marys son had died at the hands of his people abandoned by his friends and betrayed by judas whom he loved but could not save silent contemplation of the culminating paradox of the incarnation which was useless for the redemption of at least one personal friend the opening of the soul to this ultimate silence of the piet is the culmination of the slow maturing of the three previous forms of missionary silence

4845581 sweetie stop and reread that paragraph again youve got to understand this point i know it sounds strange to you but youve got to try and open to the idea once you start to seriously practice it it will make a lot more sense to you youll feel the difference in your health and well being
4845582 the male belongs to yang yangs nature is such that the male is easily aroused but also quick to retreat the female belongs to yin yins nature is such that the female is slow to be aroused and also slow to be satiated
4845583 all relevant data from the 12000 to 8000 bc period indicate that precivilized woman enjoyed full sexual freedom and was often totally incapable of controlling her sexual drive therefore i propose that one of the reasons for the long delay between the earliest development of agriculture c 12000 bc and the rise of urban life and the beginning of recorded knowledge c 8000 5000 bc was the ungovernable cyclic sexual drive of women not until these drives were gradually brought under control by rigidly enforced social codes could family life become the stabilizing and creative crucible from which modern civilized man could emerge
4845584 a man may attain health and longevity if he practices an ejaculation frequency of twice monthly or 24 times in a year if at the same time he pays careful attention to proper diet and exercise he will have a long and healthy life
4845585 as the great taoist doctor sun points out diet exercise and sexual discipline form the three pillars of taoist health and longevity regimens
4845586 we want to check whether we are capable of projecting power over that kind of distances if not more
4845587 secondly we want to test our logistic and administrative abilities to support such a large number of people so far away from home without much difficulty in addition the iaf also wanted to check whether its personnel are capable of operating in varied environments without much loss of effectiveness

4845589 it is a myth that classical music lacks an audience in the country
4845590 classical music is a high end product and it is important to create a buzz around it through proper marketing
4845591 the mobile phone is the future of music due to an increasing mobile market physical music sales have gone down drastically youth are discovering and accessing music through free internet sites there is a shift from music ownership to music consumption classical musicians too should recognise the potential of this platform
4845592 classical music is a super niche category so the market for classical music downloads in india is almost negligible while bollywood commands a market share of 60 to 65 of the entire music industry regional music is making its presence felt with a share of around 30 the share for classical music is as low as 1
4845593 there can be a sizeable audience for classical music only if it is incorporated in bollywood films
4845594 money has become a major player in determining the success of classical music more corporate support accompanied with efficient organising skills can breathe much needed life into this medium
4845595 connecting with the youth is an important aspect in popularising classical music
4845596 the new generation of classical musicians is opting for fusion music and releasing their music videos which helps attract a wider audience

4845612 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4845613 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4845614 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4845615 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4845616 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4845617 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4845618 its nice to meet you lets get to know eachother a bit better
4845619 a defining moment in the history of a free iraq
4845620 it was just a matter of time before the government was going to have to deal with it
4845621 it was his military planning it was his causing the troops to go from point a to point b
4845622 and its exactly what a lot of folks here in america were wondering whether or not iraq would even be able to do it in the first place and its happening
4845623 esas calificadoras a las que se les pas por las orejas la crisis de las hipotecas de estados unidos ahora quieren convencernos a los argentinos de que estamos en problemas

4845635 she has a doctorate in accounting from the university of texas at austin arguably one of the best programs in the country
4845636 she has made a lot of contributions to the accounting profession and opened doors to african american students in the profession we thought the students would learn a lot from all that she has to offer
4845637 were hiring her to do something that shes high qualified to do and very good at
4845638 given her qualifications as a professional and our needs i thought this was a win win situation

4845646 to be a member of a church is not necessarily to descend into mindlessness and a mind as fine as obamas is less likely to accept ideas unexamined than most
4845647 an ideal opponent all i had to do was keep my mouth shut and start planning my swearing in ceremony
4845648 now i dont know whether obama has re considered the issue or whether hes simply playing politics nowadays id like to think its the former
4845649 demoncracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religious specific issues
4845650 god in public the bible and politics in tomorrows world
4845651 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4845652 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4845653 the stuff thats left behind now is being used its a residual that before was simply wasted
4845654 we recognized there was an opportunity in using them for biofuel so we developed a biofibre policy whereby we would be able to look at that from a fuel perspective
4845655 it is an arena that has a lot of potential but its not a silver bullet and right now its being painted as a sort of bullet to the forestry industry and for climate change as well
4845656 whereas it has potential in both of those camps to some extent looking at it as a silver bullet as opposed to just one of the dimensions of the overall tool kit is very dangerous
4845657 we dont see that the government has taken any of our comments seriously at all and are not looking at it through the lens of long term forest health
4845658 if it is necessary to provide baseline subsidies to biofibre projects is this a promising sign for an effective new forestry paradigm

4845667 this is not an insect i was looking forward to seeing here said phil pellitteri a uw madison entomologist
4845668 i looked at these ash trees and there was nothing wrong with them williamson recalled
4845669 i called and asked if i was in the right place but then i climbed up one of the trees and there were the d shaped exit holes of the insects it was just that at low population densities it is almost undetectable
4845670 if you have a tree and it doesnt have ash borers what can you do to protect it before it gets it williamson asked
4845671 sometimes a pesticide will work and sometimes it will fail williamson said
4845672 the question is why and we dont have a reason
4845673 if you have a greater than 40 percent dieback in the canopy its not in your best interest to try any kind of rescue treatment williamson said
4845674 at that point its very difficult for that tree to recover

4845682 well it is just a trial and so i guess we are open to looking at data but we need to be cautious about introducing another aspect into our health care system
4845683 we do know that we are able to address the doctor shortage by having additional doctors come through the system
4845684 its very important that we stick with what we know works there is no really convincing evidence from elsewhere in the world that we need to look at another category of health professional
4845685 theyre not actually testing physicians assistants against positions like nurse practitioners
4845686 were saying that if youre going to have a trial you should actually at least test those positions against currently existing positions such as nurse practitioners

4845701 obviously theres a lot of sun in australia but with the recent change in government theres a policy environment that could be much more favorable for us
4845702 we decided to get in now it was a little opportunistic as the owners of solar sales were looking to monetize their investment it follows a model of a previous acquisition in italy where we got in before the market headed north
4845703 i think that its potentially a good market in the future
4845704 but its not living up to its potential because theres a set of mixed signals from the federal and state governments and no certainty from one year to the next

4845707 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4845708 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4845709 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4845710 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4845711 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4845712 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4845713 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4845727 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4845728 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4845729 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4845730 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4845731 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4845732 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4845733 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4845734 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4845735 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

4845744 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4845745 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4845746 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4845747 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4845748 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4845749 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4845750 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4845751 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4845752 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4845753 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4845754 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4845755 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4845756 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4845757 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4845758 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4845759 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4845760 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4845761 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4845762 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4845763 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4845764 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4845765 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4845766 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
4845767 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
4845768 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4845769 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4845770 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4845771 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4845772 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4845773 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4845774 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4845775 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4845776 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4845777 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4845778 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4845779 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4845780 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4845781 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4845782 we dont have massive volumes of solar planned for the u s in the short term
4845783 already companies are putting projects on hold and preparing to send thousands of jobs overseas real jobs that would otherwise be filled by american workers
4845784 the planet will always be here but we may not
4845785 we have an onboard fuel creation device on an envoy in adelaide australia
4845786 you mentioned onboard fuel production this car doesnt happen to run on piss does it
4845787 do as i do concept not the do as i say concept
4845788 rapid and decisive solutions of the world energy crisis and global warming
4845789 the stuff thats left behind now is being used its a residual that before was simply wasted
4845790 we recognized there was an opportunity in using them for biofuel so we developed a biofibre policy whereby we would be able to look at that from a fuel perspective
4845791 it is an arena that has a lot of potential but its not a silver bullet and right now its being painted as a sort of bullet to the forestry industry and for climate change as well
4845792 whereas it has potential in both of those camps to some extent looking at it as a silver bullet as opposed to just one of the dimensions of the overall tool kit is very dangerous
4845793 we dont see that the government has taken any of our comments seriously at all and are not looking at it through the lens of long term forest health
4845794 if it is necessary to provide baseline subsidies to biofibre projects is this a promising sign for an effective new forestry paradigm
4845795 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4845796 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4845797 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4845798 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4845799 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4845800 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4845801 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4845802 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4845803 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4845804 making the decision to retire from my position as vice chancellor has not been easy
4845805 i have enjoyed my time as vice chancellor but it is simply time for me to explore the rest of my life
4845806 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4845807 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4845808 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4845809 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4845810 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4845811 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4845812 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4845813 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4845814 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4845815 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4845816 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4845817 state of the art methods of customization make it possible for you to create entry doors that are made to the order of your home
4845818 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4845819 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4845820 and what costumes shall the poor girl wear to all tomorrows parties a blackened shroud a hand me down gown of rags and silks a costume for all tomorrow parties and what shall she do with thursdays rags when monday comes around shell turn once more to sundays clown and cry behind the door
4845821 lou reed of the velvet underground whose anger with solanas was well known stated publicly that he did not want any film about her to be made and would not allow the filmmakers to use his music
4845822 we go home on monday but we wanna tell ya weve really had a gas this time really had a gas
4845823 the citys history has been etched in dark and tragic tones
4845824 the photography here generally has fragility nuance and sadness to it a sensuality and delicacy something darker and untouchable that is unique to st petersburg
4845825 in 1981 a nineteen old unknown graffiti writer took the new york art world by storm the rest is art history
4845826 jean michel basquiat american painter died from a heroin od on august 12 1988
4845827 the sense i got about him from his work and what i found out about his life was a profound sense of aloneness a real sense of isolation
4845828 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4845829 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4845830 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4845831 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4845832 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4845833 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4845834 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4845835 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4845836 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4845837 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4845838 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4845839 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4845840 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4845841 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4845842 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4845843 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4845844 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4845845 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4845846 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4845847 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4845848 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4845849 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4845850 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4845851 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4845852 este equipo tiene hambre de victorias y una excelente forma de entender el f tbol y seguramente habr recompensa
4845853 con el menor ruido posible porque el ruido distrae y desdibuja la gesti n
4845854 todo su apoyo pero no para m sino para la instituci n y a nuestro modelo de gesti n
4845855 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4845856 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4845857 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4845858 afrontar el reto de reconquistaros para que os anim is a venir al estadio sea cuando sea y veng is de donde veng is

4845860 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4845861 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4845862 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4845863 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4845864 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4845865 we are a company that is active in more than 20 countries with many remote users and decentralized offices
4845866 mcafee desktop firewall 8 5 includes connection aware policies which help administrators easily process specific policies based on whether a users connection criteria is met now we can issue different firewall policies to clients whether theyre within our corporate network or accessing it from some remote location through different connection types this helps us enforce regulatory compliance decrease help desk tickets manage patches and improve our overall security
4845867 luke ridnour never had to make the move to oklahoma the point guards agent lon babby called ridnour at his suburban seattle home and told him he might be traded
4845868 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his left foot for some time
4845869 he consulted a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined surgery was the best path to take
4845870 he will miss the start of the 2008 09 season but the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season
4845871 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4845872 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4845873 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4845874 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4845875 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4845876 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4845877 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4845878 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4845879 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4845880 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4845881 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4845882 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4845883 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4845884 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4845885 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4845886 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4845887 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4845888 esta es una buena oportunidad hay que saberla aprovechar para dejar en alto al equipo
4845889 estamos empezando a so ar en este torneo sudamericano es nuestra primera experiencia y vamos a tratar de llegar lejos
4845890 espero que los jugadores disfruten esto una sudamericana no se vive todos los d as
4845891 es verdad que se produjo un peque o incidente entre mandra y preciado al d a siguiente superaron el problema por lo que la armon a de deportivo quito est muy bien pero los dos jugadores fueron multados
4845892 la cantidad no puedo precisarla porque es un tema que se ha manejado y superado de manera interna es decir entre los jugadores y los directivos del club
4845893 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4845894 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4845895 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4845896 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4845897 esta es una buena oportunidad hay que saberla aprovechar para dejar en alto al equipo
4845898 es nuestra primera experiencia y vamos a tratar de llegar lejos
4845899 espero que los jugadores disfruten esto una sudamericana no se vive todos los d as
4845900 brasil siempre se caracteriz por un juego lento que maneja la pelota que toca muy bien y a sus jugadores hay que respetarlos porque tienen mucha calidad y te pueden ganar el partido en cualquier momento
4845901 lo que tenemos que tratar de hacer nosotros es aprovechar la velocidad que a veces tenemos arriba de ag ero messi rom n riquelme que a veces hace pases que s lo los ve l tenemos que seguir aprovechando todo eso
4845902 argentina y brasil tienen una historia muy grande dentro del f tbol y es normal que muchas veces se viva de una manera especial este partido porque somos los dos de sudam rica estamos los dos al lado uno del otro y creo que son dos potencias hoy por hoy en el f tbol
4845903 muchas veces el partido que todos nosotros deseamos jugar y que todo el mundo desea ver porque son siempre partidos lindos
4845904 los argentinos llevamos el f tbol en la sangre y muchas veces no nos damos cuenta los que estamos jugando y salimos siempre a jugar igual ya sea un mundial una olimpiada o un partido amistoso
4845905 la celeste y blanca para nosotros representa mucho defender a un pa s que sufre que muchas veces en argentina mucha gente est pendiente para que argentina le pueda dar tambi n una alegr a
4845906 todos sabemos que quieras o no hay rivalidad pero es un partido m s hay que jugarlo ellos tambi n jugaron hoy en el alargue pr rroga est n cansados de jugar 120 minutos y nosotros igual as que esperemos que salgan bien las cosas en nuestro favor
4845907 maradona comi con nosotros a mediod a en el hotel y ahora estuvo en el vestuario antes y despu s del partido
4845908 vino y dio felicitaciones a todos por el esfuerzo que hicimos por todas las cosas buenas que nos pudieron salir en el partido y estaba contento porque nos fue bien
4845909 lleg repartiendo sonrisas levantando el nimo el esp ritu de todos los chicos como para que encaremos el partido de la mejor manera
4845910 ganamos el partido porque estuvimos mejor en la pr rroga pero igual tuvimos much simas chances como las tuvieron ellos
4845911 luego tendr que volver a holanda y aguantar la que venga sea para mal o para bien
4845912 hay un clima de reverencia a brasil y eso obedece no s lo a la candidatura es la econom a del pa s que crece y el liderazgo pol tico del presidente luiz in cio lula da silva lo que representa un factor de estabilidad en una regi n marcada por inestabilidades
4845913 brasil es hoy una referencia pol tica de estabilidad democr tica y un liderazgo positivo que sirve de moderador y adem s contamos con el carisma de lula
4845914 no fue algo aislado el supuesto apoyo de china a brasil jos ramos horta presidente de timor oriental le dijo a lula que va a redactar un manifiesto de ganadores del premio nobel de la paz en favor de la candidatura de r o y el presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy afirm que le lleg la hora a r o de janeiro
4845915 estados unidos es un mercado importante y el coi ya tiene ese mercado con europa es igual china es un mercado nuevo que ahora abrieron entonces en ese contexto brasil es un pa s nuevo con concentraci n enorme de j venes y eso puede ser til para el coi
4845916 al comit le gusta actuar para dejar legados en la asamblea del coi fue dicho con todas letras que en la opini n de ellos los juegos ol mpicos de pek n contribuy para la apertura del pa s china al mundo y unos juegos ol mpicos en brasil pueden dejar un enorme legado para la juventud
4845917 tenemos que probar que somos confiables es necesario romper con la percepci n internacional negativa en relaci n a la capacidad de inversiones de brasil y sobre la oferta de juegos totalmente seguros en el pa s
4845918 estoy convencido que somos capaces pero el problema es convencer a los otros de eso los juegos panamericanos ofrecieron al mundo una fotograf a de lo que puede ser la seguridad de unos juegos ol mpicos en brasil no hubo ning n incidente y el crimen com n fue reducido
4845919 es un problema com n para todos estamos nivelados brasil tiene incluso alguna ventaja relativa por ser un pa s pac fico sin terrorismo pero la preparaci n tiene que ser muy rigurosa
4845920 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4845921 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4845922 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4845923 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4845924 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4845925 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4845926 energy generation has been void of technological development for 50 years and that makes it ripe for change
4845927 we think the cost to produce and install is less than the average cost of electricity in california
4845928 he competido con tres generaciones de atletas rusos y con los mejores marchadores del mundo durante los ltimos doce a os ahora ha llegado el momento de dar el testigo a una nueva generaci n de marchadores latinoamericanos que tienen que asumir la responsabilidad
4845929 habl demasiado y demasiado pronto no tuve un desvanecimiento pero s un fuerte dolor en la espalda a la altura de las v as respiratorias se organiz un buen revuelo pero en cuanto los m dicos me miraron y me dejaron reposar un poco se pas el dolor
4845930 es bonito volver a un podio ol mpico 12 a os despu s pero plata es plata igual que oro es oro y bronce es bronce
4845931 ya tengo la maestr a en negocios y ahora quiero hacer el doctorado en espa a y en estados unidos durante los pr ximos a os despu s asumir la responsabilidad que seguramente me tendr preparada mi pa s
4845932 la medalla estar a bien pero lucho por ser el n mero uno
4845933 we can produce a lot faster than what we can install
4845934 its an election year and it has become part of the political stalemate
4845935 having a significant effect on the development of new business
4845936 no of course not you dont heal really you just go on
4845937 how did you transform how did this breaking of your heart convert and change you
4845938 what transformation occurred so that i may understand and have hope for when i too am torn asunder by the great losses that are coming to me in this life
4845939 one of the great things to come out of these olympic games is that the tremendous use of our digital properties online and the great viewership online and the tremendous number of page views is really teaching us a tremendous amount about what people want to consume great content and so were going to come out of these olympics with great digital knowledge and hopefully well be able to turn those digital pennies into digital if not dollars digital 50 cent pieces at some point
4845940 die staatsanwaltschaft allerdings bezweifelt dass dieser fall berhaupt objektiv bewertet werden muss
4845941 tenemos ya la presunta identificaci n de una persona que podr a ser el autor material sin embargo estamos presentando todas las pruebas correspondientes a la fiscal a general de la naci n para que las valoren y tomen alguna decisi n
4845942 we were shooting the breeze and i mentioned that i had replaced all the light bulbs in my house with compact fluorescent lights and my utility bill had come down by a third
4845943 and he said hey did you know that solar cells are made of silicon
4845944 we started talking about what a business plan would look like because if something is made out of silicon then intel should be taking advantage of that market
4845945 the solar industry today looks like the microelectronics industry in the late 70s theres very few standards and no one is manufacturing at scale
4845946 its all about manufacturing processes and material sciences that will lead to fundamental breakthroughs the product is vastly simpler than a microprocessor but the fundamental nature of a solar cell isnt all that different when you think of what it takes to manufacture globally and manage supply chains thats intels core competence
4845947 we do believe we will have a technological advantage when we get what were doing in the lab to manufacturing

4845950 from an outward appearance the panel appears to be fixed but internally light is being steered to the solar cell through the electronics
4845951 it just turned out that colin and his team became aware of the work we were doing with oregon state and started the dialog
4845952 russland wollte schon im jahre 1974 einen menschen zum roten planeten schicken und entwickelte daf r die m chtige tr gerrakete n 1 bislang galt diese als eine reine mondrakete die in konkurrenz zur saturn 5 der usa entwickelt wurde nun muss die geschichte der bemannten sowjetischen raumfahrt in teilen umgeschrieben werden

4845973 som dere vet har jeg f tt greie p hvor jeg skal havne til slutt og jeg arbeider m lrettet og utrettelig for at flest mulig skal f lge meg dit husk jeg er denne verdens fyrste og har evnen til styre menneskers f lelser og lyster dette bruker jeg aktivt
4845974 ja men vi har jo en mektig kirke drevet av en mektig stat og den er vel et problem
4845975 statskirke ordningen er en genial ordning for f avviklet kirke og kristenliv jeg har et utmerket samarbeid med et forbund som reklamerer med humanisme og etikk men de har helt andre spilleregler n r de jobber for meg for bli kvitt kristendommen mine n kkelpersoner har jeg plassert i strategisk viktige posisjoner i det politiske system og vi g r for en gradvis avkristning s langsom at de f rreste reagerer p det som skjer forbud og forf lgelser har vi fors kt andre steder f eks i kina og det virker mot min hensikt
4845976 hva kan vi gj re for at det skal g litt fortere
4845977 det er viktig at kirkens ansatte f lger mine n kkelpersoners anvisning om hva de skal si og l re de f som fremdeles g r i kirken
4845978 men folk kan da h re om v r fiende andre steder enn i kirken
4845979 men radio og tv har stadig f rre og d rligere kristne programmer andakter og overf ring av gudstjenester jeg og mine medarbeidere arbeider aktivt for at det som fortsatt kommer blir stadig d rligere f r det slutter helt dessuten skal vi gi bedre plass i radio og tv til positive programmer om helt andre religioner
4845980 vi har n dd et viktig m l n r vi n har f tt undervisning og oppl ring i kristendom ut av skolen
4845981 jo men det er enda litt som mangler kirken er n det eneste som kan bringe kristentroen videre men det er jeg ogs godt i gang med f stoppet det er s bra at jeg har klart styre kirken mot stadig mindre oppslutning alle vet at menneskene forandrer seg gjennom tidene og n r de skal forandre kirken ogs forandrer de trosinnhold og tviholder p formene for mange er gudstjenesten bare blitt en seremoni med vanskelige ord og begreper symbolikk som de ikke forst r mye staffasje og fakter men lite reellt innhold for sv rt mange men s er det vel bare en av hundre som g r i kirken en vanlig s ndag og jeg skal f det til bli enda f rre
4845982 det er viktig at s f som mulig trives i gudstjenesten for da kommer det ikke s mange og dermed reduserer vi muligheten for at nye mennesker skal komme til tro den musikkstil jeg har innbilt kirken at de m holde er ett av mine mest geniale trekk orgelet er det dyreste instrumentet som finnes og bare en overhaling kan koste millioner er det ikke genialt at jeg f r kirken til bruke millioner p et instrument som holder folk borte jeg feiret virkelig seieren den dag jeg h rte om menigheten som hadde en slump penger de kunne bruke p enten orgelet eller ungdomsarbeidet og de valgte satse p orgelet
4845983 men vi har da vel ikke bare statskirken sloss imot
4845984 helt korrekt alle de sm frimenigheter og organisasjoner kan v re farlige og noen av dem har begynt vokse seg store de holder en musikkstil som folk trives med de fleste har et enkelt spr k som blir forst tt og presten ligner til forveksling p et menneske her m vi samle kreftene for bli kvitt v r fiende

4845986 moktada al sadr the iraqi shiite cleric on friday called on his followers to sign in blood a pledge of loyalty to the shiite saint after whom he named the mahdi army and to affirm their commitment to ridding iraq of u s troops
4845987 only a few hundred people turned up friday at sadrist offices in sadr city and najaf to sign the covenant as millions of shiites were already heading by foot car and minibus to the shiite holy city of karbala to celebrate the birthday of muhammad al mahdi a ninth century saint and the last of 12 imams revered by shiites
4845988 it was during this holiday last year that sadrs forces fought a turf war on the streets of karbala amid millions of shiite pilgrims drawing widespread criticism from the shiite community and forcing them days later to declare a cease fire
4845989 the announcement by sadr was dismissed by his political opponents as a sign of weakness
4845990 one time he talks about peaceful resistance and another time he says lets bring the weapons
4845991 when coalition forces stood up this school they worked with the iraqis to set up goals they wanted to achieve within a certain amount of time
4845992 some of the goals reached include the ability to run four training programs at the same time having fully renovated facilities with the ability to house 500 students and the availability of qualified iraqi instructors to lead the courses todays class represents the attainment of those goals in the bmt basic military training program
4845993 this bmt class was led by iraqi instructors under the supervision of their usaf advisors

4846024 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4846025 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4846026 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4846027 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4846028 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4846029 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4846030 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4846031 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4846032 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4846033 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4846034 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4846035 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4846036 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4846037 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4846038 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4846039 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4846040 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4846041 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4846042 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4846043 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4846044 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4846045 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4846046 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4846047 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4846052 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4846053 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4846054 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4846055 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4846056 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4846057 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4846058 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4846065 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4846066 wenn jemand ins haus einbricht dann kommt er nicht in die zimmer
4846067 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4846068 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4846069 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4846070 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4846071 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4846072 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4846073 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4846074 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4846075 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4846076 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4846077 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4846078 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4846079 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4846080 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4846081 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4846082 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4846083 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4846084 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4846085 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4846086 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4846087 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4846088 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4846089 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4846090 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4846091 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4846092 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4846093 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4846094 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4846095 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4846096 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4846097 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4846098 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4846099 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4846100 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4846101 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4846102 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4846103 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4846104 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4846105 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4846106 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4846107 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4846108 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4846109 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4846110 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4846111 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4846112 who are open to doing something on the production side
4846113 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4846114 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4846115 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4846116 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4846117 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4846118 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4846119 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4846120 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4846121 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4846122 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4846123 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4846124 ive been pursuing it but havent gotten a response from him bill davis hes still dreaming on the price
4846125 a small number of people who were not part of the main group seemed intent on causing problems officers responded quickly and effectively to minimise inconvenience to local people and those attending the rwb event
4846126 i acknowledge there were delays for road users travelling between codnor and loscoe but the illegal actions of the protesters who blocked the road made those delays inevitable
4846127 all right class that will be it for the day good work everyone remember the studio will be open for after hours work on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays beginning next week and running until the start of the exhibition
4846128 i mean i watch your class a lot and look at the paintings when the dean decided to open this row of offices over here i jumped at the chance to get one of them i just love art
4846129 ive been meaning to come take a look up here but im always too busy
4846130 mostly my day is spent on the phone or talking with people
4846131 ive only seen you in passing a couple of times before today
4846132 i host a number of events as part of the job so im often out of the office or traveling
4846133 that must be tough on your husband if youre married
4846134 i was supposed to see my boyfriend tonight the asshole but right before i ran into you he called and cancelled said there was a game on that he was going to watch with his buddies he pulls this shit all the fucking time
4846135 hang on for a second i want to get some cigarettes
4846136 i only do it when ive been drinking and in certain moods
4846137 hell i wish i were so lucky to have toys like that mitch wont let me

4846205 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4846206 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all

4846208 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4846209 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4846210 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4846211 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4846212 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4846213 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4846214 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

4846222 it seems like our finance people plan to impose a single tax rate for tobacco which is the first step
4846223 the most effective way to deter children from taking up smoking is to increase taxes on tobacco
4846224 we are a signatory to the fctc and it requires certain deadlines the first deadline is the effective health warnings on cigarette packs
4846225 were halfway there we have not banned promotions we still have limited sponsorship we can actually go the extra step

4846227 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
4846228 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4846229 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4846230 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4846231 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

4846242 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4846243 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4846244 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4846245 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4846246 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4846247 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade

4846254 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4846255 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4846256 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4846257 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4846258 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4846259 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4846260 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4846261 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4846262 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4846263 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4846264 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4846265 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4846266 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4846267 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4846268 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4846269 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate

4846274 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4846275 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4846276 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4846277 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4846278 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4846279 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4846280 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4846281 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4846282 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4846283 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4846284 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home

4846287 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4846288 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now

4846306 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal

4846351 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4846352 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4846353 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4846354 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4846355 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4846356 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4846357 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4846358 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4846359 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4846360 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4846361 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4846362 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4846363 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4846364 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4846365 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4846366 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4846367 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4846368 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4846369 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4846370 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4846371 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4846372 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4846373 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4846374 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4846375 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4846376 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4846377 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4846378 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4846379 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4846380 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4846381 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4846382 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4846383 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4846384 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4846385 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4846386 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4846387 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4846388 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4846389 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4846390 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4846391 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4846392 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4846393 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4846394 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4846395 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4846396 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4846397 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4846398 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4846399 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4846400 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4846401 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4846402 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4846403 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4846404 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4846405 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4846406 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
4846407 i dont speak about it to get paid for it
4846408 i speak about it because i love it i understand theyre a family restaurant but i think it cant hurt them to have a little spice
4846409 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4846410 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4846411 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
4846412 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4846413 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4846414 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4846415 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4846416 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4846417 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4846418 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4846419 what do you want your look to say to people
4846420 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4846421 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4846422 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4846423 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4846424 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4846425 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4846426 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4846427 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4846428 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4846429 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4846430 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4846431 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4846432 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4846433 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4846434 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4846435 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4846436 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4846437 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4846438 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4846439 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4846440 i said that i shall tell you of the pain in my heart when you come what can i say all pain leaves the heart when youre here
4846441 jerry is a dirty old man there are things he did in that house that you guys need to see on youtube hes not gingerly or grandfather y he loves the women and he loves to keep himself in the mix as much as i do but jerry stands behind the honor of being a marine the whole truth and loyal thing while at same time throwing as much dirt and lies around as everybody else
4846442 shes explored the church of scientology she tried kabbalah and now this i think its just another phase but either way shes involving god in her life and im happy about that
4846443 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4846444 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4846445 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4846446 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4846447 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4846448 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4846449 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4846450 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4846451 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4846452 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4846453 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4846454 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4846455 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4846456 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4846457 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4846458 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4846459 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4846460 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4846461 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4846462 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4846463 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4846464 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4846465 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4846466 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4846467 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4846468 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4846469 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4846470 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4846471 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4846472 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4846473 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4846474 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4846475 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4846476 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4846477 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4846478 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4846479 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4846480 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4846483 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4846484 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4846485 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4846486 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4846487 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4846488 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4846489 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4846490 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4846491 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4846492 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4846493 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4846494 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4846495 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4846496 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4846497 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4846498 ich will damit sagen dass es nicht nur auf eine verl ssliche registrierung und graduierung psychopathologischer zielsymptome ankommt sondern es bedarf der ber cksichtigung eines den symptomen bergeordneten bezugssysteme durch dessen beachtung die auswirkungen bestimmter st rungsmuster festgelegt werden k nnen
4846499 das heisst in bezug auf die konzeption des strafrechts wird grundlegend an der schuldf higkeit und verantwortung des menschen festgehalten und nicht an der intensit t psychopahtologischer ph nomene
4846500 genau die berlegungen zur frage einer psychiatrischen untersuchungsmethode zum thema schuldf higkeit f hren immer wieder zu dem resultat dass unabh ngig von den positionen die in bezug auf die theoretische legitimation des strafrechts denkbar erscheinen ein zweispuriges vorgehen angemessen ist gemeint ist einerseits eine sichere intersubjektiv g ltige und verschiedene auspr gungsgrade der ph nomene erfassende diagnostik und andererseits eine betrachtung des stellenwerts der verschiedenen einzelparameter f r die seelische organisation die das ausmass der zerst rerischen wirkung der erkrankung festlegt und nach tiefenpsychologischer auffassung ist kriminalit t durch fr he sch digung der pers nlichkeitsentwicklung durch st rungen in den objektbeziehungen des kindes bedingt so definieren es die analytiker und aus der anderen psychologischen methodenlehre der behaviouristischen kommt die meinung dass delinquenz durch die beschaffenheit der umwelt und nicht durch die eigenschaft der einzelperson ausgel st wird aber in beiden f llen wird delinquenz als besondere form der krankheit oder als ein st rfall aufgefasst

4846546 my uncle atahualpa at that time was in cajamarca and he received them and hernando pizarro very well giving to one of them a golden cup in which to drink the beverage that we use
4846547 how do i know what it is that you give me leave get out of here
4846548 twice golden cups filled with chichi are offered and twice they are refused making it impossible for atahualpa to reach any accord with the spaniards
4846549 cummins concluded that only seven types of human representation occur in kero imagery three types have limited representation on keros spaniards which occur only in the dance motif negroes which were the african servants of the spaniards and also appear only in the dance motif and the colla who appear only in the agricultural motif the colla are an indigenous non inca race of people from collasuyu the andean region south of the four other types of human representation occur in almost every type of scene
4846550 cummins also placed the kero in 9 categories based on the motifs found on the vessels these categories are the tocapu figural motif the rainbow motif the battle and or presentation motif inca and or coya motif agricultural motif the dance motif the jungle motif and geometric flora fauna motifs

4846599 the draft bill the trafficking in persons bill allows for all forms of human trafficking to be prosecuted including labour exploitation and not only sexual exploitation
4846600 prosecutions have proceeded on an ad hoc basis overtly demonstrable to the facts such as kidnapping indecent assault and rape which do not individually attract as heavy sentences as a specific trafficking in persons would impose

4846622 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
4846623 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
4846624 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
4846625 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
4846626 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
4846627 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it

4846643 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge a serpent shall bite him
4846644 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices
4846645 we were saying when we started that we were interested in the cognitive development of children primarily letters numbers preparing them for school i think fred would have said is that he is interested in the affective development of children the psychological and emotional development of children so we saw us as operating in more in two different spheres so i think the two shows in some ways are closer but still extremely complimentary and children deserve those two shows

4846647 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4846648 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4846649 the lord shall come and all his saints with him
4846650 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet but shall receive power as if kings one hour with the beast these have one mind and give their strength and power to the beast these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them because he is the lord of lords and the king of kings
4846651 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus
4846652 saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent
4846653 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

4846658 the relationship between expectation and therapeutic outcome is a wonderful model to understand mind body interaction
4846659 a variation in the speed of light could solve the problem but this too is impotent in the face of the question why
4846660 i have no doubts that events above 1020 electronvolts exist there are sufficient examples to convince me
4846661 one possibility is that there is something wrong with the akeno results another is that einstein was wrong
4846662 unable to explain our findings and are reporting them to encourage others to investigate this phenomenon
4846663 if i could have my pick i would like to learn that newtons laws must be modified in order to correctly describe gravitational interactions at large distances
4846664 thats more appealing than a universe filled with a new kind of sub nuclear particle
4846665 if the results turn out to be real the implications are profound we may have to rewrite physics and chemistry
4846666 every mission to mars has produced evidence supporting my conclusion none has contradicted it
4846667 something on mars is ingesting nutrients metabolising them and then belching out radioactive methane
4846668 maybe the universe would have collapsed before it had any chance to expand
4846669 this could be a reason for four neutrons hitting the ganil detectors simultaneously
4846670 we only have proposals none of which has been demonstrated
4846671 of course i hope it is due to new physics how stupendous that would be but once a physicist starts working on the basis of hope he is heading for a fall
4846672 theorists are still floundering around looking for a sensible explanation
4846673 were all hoping that upcoming observations of supernovae of clusters of galaxies and so on will give us more clues
4846674 i am still waiting for a definitive explanation that makes sense
4846675 weve seen many signals like this and these sorts of signals have always turned out to be interference
4846676 it was either a powerful astronomical event or an advanced alien civilisation beaming out a signal
4846677 its difficult to say how long its going to take
4846678 the more we look at these new data the more difficulties we see
4846679 cold fusion would make the worlds energy problems melt away no wonder the department of energy is interested
4846680 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4846681 well yes maam that is for the cleaning we can clean the carpet and theyll look great but it wont take care of your odor problem that required carpet to come up and several extra hours of work

4846710 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4846711 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4846712 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4846713 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4846714 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4846715 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4846716 all he talked about was his family and this city
4846717 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
4846718 wed start shooting at 9 or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
4846719 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
4846720 this is supposed to be like an informal section of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
4846721 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way
4846722 the fact that he wasnt controlled wasnt reading prepared lines it was raw and it was powerful and i think it was who he really was
4846723 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
4846724 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
4846725 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
4846726 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4846727 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4846728 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4846729 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4846730 the mapva is comprised men and women who advocate for disabled veterans many of whom are disabled veterans themselves throughout the state and hunters and anglers appreciate the sacrifice these incredible men and women
4846731 without our men and women in the military we wouldnt have our right to keep and bear arms nor would we be able to participate in the outdoors activities we so love its time for us to pay tribute to them
4846732 i am overwhelmed by the support we have received thus far in this endeavor and each day shows more
4846733 the iron plainsmen motorcycle club has even scheduled a poker run to help raise funds on the 23rd of august also already were planning next years event at a much bigger venue
4846734 to think this all started with a little turkey hunt in northeast oklahoma is almost mind boggling
4846735 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
4846736 the copy of andreas vesalius de fabrica which you featured recently is shelved a few feet from a regular readers office for that reason he can report that it now resides in bethesda maryland and that it once belonged to the great lutheran theologian and scholar philipp melancthon 1497 1560 who wrote in it a poem in praise of the belgian anatomist although melancton was neither an anatomist nor astronomer he was thoroughly acquainted with the science of his day and widely influential for his science teaching and scientific textbooks
4846737 you will be in our thoughts and prayers may you have a quick recovery and we are sorry for you loss god bless
4846738 enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it
4846739 from what i saw last night it was just a move of god
4846740 it was primarily a grassroots movement of people that finally had its moment of expression
4846741 we found the heart of texas right here in tyler
4846742 there were people here tonight who had no idea who donald miller or sara groves are
4846743 we hoped to raise enough to build 10 wells for african families which costs about 40 000
4846744 we came away with almost 80 000 thats 20 wells and enough to service a city the size of tyler with clean water for an entire year think of how thats going to impact people in africa
4846745 children cant go to school because they are busy walking miles to fetch water
4846746 by helping them get clean water they can be healthy and also go to school
4846747 tyler was just ready to do something like this i guess i think people in area churches have been looking for a way to do something significant and do it together im the new guy in town but i havent even heard of anything like this much less seen it
4846748 i was absolutely overwhelmed tyler can really be proud of what happened last night ive never seen anything like it before we have the martin luther king jr rally every year but there were far more people at this
4846749 id never heard of the blood water mission before this
4846750 the project itself to give a single dollar for a single african child to have clean water for a single year who could say no to that thats why we came
4846751 id told the study group that as bad as things were for them there were people in worse situations in america we have access to clean water all the time in water fountains but others dont i showed them how many people die in africa each year from disease from bad water a dollar can get one person clean water for a year and be healthy to go to school or avoid hiv aids
4846752 i bet we could even do that you can find a dollar in change lying on the ground i bet we could find a 100 in change on the ground if we tried
4846753 we soon met that goal and we set another goal at 500 then 1 000
4846754 your story is so amazing and its really the heart of everything what were doing
4846755 one person reaching out and making a difference even in their own situations youre an inspiration to all of us
4846756 im still trying to process it all its awesome to have an amazing artist like sara groves recognize our people they have been trampled on and not shown respect by so much of society for them to see they could be used by god and inspire others was amazing
4846757 we recieved e mails at new gate from all over the world from people who were inspired by our efforts
4846758 it showed everybody that homeless people can contribute and provide for others
4846759 we just asked regular people to give what they could we broke the money counting machine at the bank with the bills we had we still have bags and bags of coins
4846760 i leave feeling im not doing it right i love church im part of a great church in portland and the pastor is my best friend but i dont go there much
4846761 i have the common book of prayer and a catholic devotional i use most i spend a lot of time in prayer i like to pray
4846762 i see things in front of me social injustice hurting people and god seems to talk to me through that on this tour ive been learning to love people that i cant see those in africa and ive never done that before
4846763 whether he talks to me directly i dont know i can see things like love or jealousy in front of me and i learn from that but i do act on things i think god has said to me
4846764 thats what really is needed in this town someone to provide that leadership
4846765 i think there needs to be more cooperation between black white and hispanic churches it hasnt really been all that effective in the past i dont know why that is but if there is a project of common interest to all of us i think weve shown that well all rally behind it
4846766 it wasnt us it was sovereign this was beyond any one church there were churches represented here yes but it was a movement of people beyond church lines it was people who wanted to taste the living water
4846767 id rather have a slice of the bible than a slice of that cake
4846768 how come your cat has her own couch while you dont

4846772 what tips and resources do you have on making money online
4846773 at times the clouds blackened the sky all the way to and much of the soil was completely deposited into the to make matters worse all this happened during the great depression when much of the work force was unemployed broke homeless and destitute

4846785 your provider didnt act fast enough to disconnect abusers or has no clue how to install preventive measures against spammers
4846786 when you are 25 or 30 retirement seems like a long time away but if people begin to save even a relatively modest amount they can look forward to a much more comfortable retirement
4846787 during the past 12 months the cost of basics such as food petrol and utility bills has dramatically increased but with household budgets feeling squeezed there is a danger that pension contributions might be delayed or suspended as people focus on the short term rather than the long term to ease the cost of everyday living however delaying your pension contributions can be very expensive
4846788 i cant stress highly enough that the early contributions are the most valuable ones as they enjoy the longest period of investment growth

4846828 if they carve out an exception for him i guarantee you well all be trying to seal divorce records
4846829 but then we have to explain to them that we just cant do it
4846830 i dont have a beef with him trying to keep his private life private
4846831 the problem is that he seemed to do it in an unprecedented manner i will be extremely interested to see if the courts grant him the power to seal it
4846832 public access protects litigants both present and future because justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly
4846833 treating the house speakers divorce records like all other citizens will keep any back door politics and special favors in check
4846834 surely public officials are not entitled to special secrecy of their divorces simply because they are public officials
4846835 the court finds that the harm otherwise resulting to the interest of the parties and their children which are the subject of this action outweighs any public interest and access to that portion of the record
4846836 are typically cases where the parties think their children could be impacted
4846837 its a gold mine of financial information that crooks could get at the courthouse

4846852 but especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
4846853 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home in the end
4846854 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got some good help around him
4846855 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game
4846856 their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
4846857 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
4846858 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them
4846859 we were playing the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
4846860 fathers can overcome some of the long term consequences of divorce by cultivating a close connection with their children
4846861 handling situations where there isnt an etiquette rule is about understanding how to combine manners with three fundamental principles that form the basis of how we get along with each other demonstrating respect showing consideration and being honest
4846862 its especially risky for men not to be connected with family
4846863 when men start to become disconnected from family they are more likely to get involved in behaviors that are going to be harmful to themselves or to their family they dont have the institution that was providing their life with meaning and direction the men really hit hard by divorce tend to be those who dont have a large support network in place
4846864 men in depression after divorce its big women are better able to assess their emotional state and more likely to get help depression for men is more closely tied to the loss of children than it is to the loss of the marriage as a result they may tend to remarry quickly to deal with this but that tends to compound the problem because the children wonder if this marriage will be successful
4846865 many children feel that one parent is responsible for the break up of their home since most children dont want a divorce they may feel angry for a while by and large this works itself out as the child matures little ones who feel theyre responsible for the divorce often work that out for themselves children get more measured views as they get older
4846866 what about the kids raising children before during and after divorce
4846867 adolescent may feel they dont want to celebrate days honoring parents because theyre angry with both of them i dont think they should try to change that
4846868 men tend to be very competitive and territorial but when theyre parenting the same child they need to think about being on the same football team not opposing teams
4846869 what is the one thing i can do to acknowledge the male father figure children need to understand there is only one dad and one mom and that will never ever change but that doesnt mean the other male in their life doesnt have good qualities they can benefit from
4846870 it can be tough to do it but its important stepfathers feel awfully neglected on fathers day if your kids dont learn good relationship skills from you than how will they know how to have a good relationship in their future
4846871 its painful to write out that check every month because it reminds you of the failure
4846872 our value in this society is about how much money i make and how much i owe
4846873 in other countries its about how much of myself i give to others and how much i am loved by them
4846874 you show you value them as a person by how much time you spend with them
4846875 celebrate fathers day regardless of whether or not you will see your kids
4846876 send them a card call them or send them an e mail telling them how much you love them and how proud you are to be their dad
4846877 in a divorce its helpful to the children if the mother encourages them to participate in the fathers day celebration especially in joint custody families where the mother is less friendly that can be a problem
4846878 its critical for moms to project the positive things about the relationship she has with the childrens father while mom may need to find a place to process the emotions so she can get to the place of speaking well about her childrens father its very helpful if she can reframe and revisit things that have occurred and speak respectfully about those in front of the kids because divorce hits kids like an earthquake in china it really helps them adjust if they dont have to deal with the negative banter
4846879 many dads are a bomb ready to go off theyre full of anger bitterness and rage that wont do any one any good
4846880 regardless of what happened they have to resolve the personal emotional issues related to distance or difficulty of divorce for the sake of their relationships with their children they can start by thinking of her as their childrens mother rather than the ex if they fail to do this they lock up their kids and keep them in a protected state where they cant experience forgiveness for something they had no part in
4846881 when you do that you put the child in cycle of despair because youre constantly saying what a lousy mom she was for a child to become healed and whole they need someone whos walked through valley of the shadow of death and not been overcome by fear of losing the relationship with the child over something you have done put the negative stuff beyond reach there will always be a time when the child will come to you and say what really happened between you and mom they will seek you out but you shouldnt push that or prompt that
4846882 if the biological dad is expecting the biological mom to do something to help the kids celebrate fathers youre now back into a relationship that didnt work in the first place
4846883 just make sure she doesnt tell the kids what theyre going to do without involving them in the decision making process she should help them do whatever it is they want to do
4846884 men for a variety of reasons tend not to support of each other
4846885 there are many dads who have great knowledge of parenting and good relationship skills but fathers havent really been affirmed in our culture so they dont tend to think these skills are very valuable if you see someone whos doing a great job as a father ask for their help in learning the skills that made them successful
4846886 in the end its about love respect generosity kindness understanding and support for one and other to reach our full potential as humans

4846899 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4846900 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4846901 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4846902 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4846903 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4846904 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4846905 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4846906 its good if we find a victim while she is still in the state of fighting her exploitation
4846907 because later the victims develop big psychological problems some develop stockholm syndrome i saw an arrest in moscow where the victim insisted on being handcuffed to her trafficker some women become terrified of anybody in uniform and totally dependent on their pimp
4846908 we have some beneficiaries who want to go back they have seen a higher level of living in the destination country this puts us in new challenges
4846909 tenho certeza de uma coisa estou bem muita gente falou que eu estava em m fase mas mostrei que estou num bom momento

4846912 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
4846913 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4846914 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4846915 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe
4846916 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4846917 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4846918 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4846919 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion
4846920 that loss has been circling round and round in my head since january that had never happened before
4846921 i worked very hard and it was very very difficult
4846922 im extremely happy now im pleased for myself and my country
4846923 i am too young and not as good as yoshida she defeated me in the asian championship and she has more experience and skills than me
4846924 i will learn from this loss in my future training i will practice harder
4846925 in the future i think i will compete with her and i will beat her

4846930 wir wollen ja nicht dass die kinder zu den leidtragenden der schlechten zahlungsmoral ihrer eltern werden denn h ufig stammen die kinder aus sozial schwachen familien aber letztlich bleibt das land berlin auf den offenen forderungen sitzen

4846939 die behauptung ist eine unversch mtheit wenn f r u erungen von abgeordneten im parlament nicht die straflosigkeit gelten w rde w rde ich gegen ihn vorgehen
4846940 bei mir soll alles f lschung sein auch die operative personenkontrolle die die stasi gegen mich einleitete nachdem sie den im vorlauf wegen nichteignung einstellte

4846948 i glanced over at the water first to see if there were any birds and was struck by how lovely the day was emerging again from the forest i walked through a wildflower meadow that was almost a cliche in its abundance of flowers and beauty and sunshine i found myself wondering what the point was in clinging so much to stuff i really couldnt change dont get me wrong there is a lot of validity in discussing conflict and working together to reach a goal that works for all parties and in my vain attempt to spare people details and also because there are more than one area of concern being dealt with i know the language here is a little vague i have no interest in stopping that process but i realize that i cant no matter how much i might think its possible get into someone elses head and they cant get into mine to go against the grain you have to make great sacrifice for such little gain and so much pain and if your plans come out to nothing washed out in the rain let me rekindle all your hopes and help you start again because i keep faith i keep faith in you

4846961 as foreigners arrive to take up short term contracts each year about 70000 skilled africans doctors engineers nurses leave to work abroad western governments should ask whether the growth of ngos is not only a symptom of africa s crisis but perhaps part of the cause

4846963 possibly the escalation is a side effect of the mugabe regimes media repression driving zimbabweans to seek independent information online
4846964 fostering a stronger media in africa is an indispensable part of tackling poverty improving development and enabling africa to attain its development goals
4846965 it was a little warm today but i thought our guys practiced well i still dont think were very sharp right now mentally or physically but were working hard as long as were working hard im happy
4846966 were having more days now where we are balancing out a bit
4846967 the offense will have a few good plays and the defense will have a few good plays earlier in the summer the offense would look good one day and the defense would look good the next day were competing better now both sides are winning their share of plays now
4846968 aaron is a very fast guy with a lot of power to him
4846969 he sets high goals for himself and really goes after them it goes back to his passion for the game
4846970 hes a big guy who is a very physical player hes really improved on his quickness and were pleased with that
4846971 he moved from safety and is finding his home hes a very intelligent football player he knows everything about our defense knows what people are trying to do to us hes a very compact player and has a good punch to him
4846972 i feel we can put any of those young guys in keep playing at a high level
4846973 hes playing sam and will hes a guy who is a very good football player hes trying to get a feel for it but hes been a good surprise for us in two a days
4846974 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4846975 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because today the final ball was not good enough but overall it has been a good week for us
4846976 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me you see the quality of a team after 38 games in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games in the final and could be drawn against second division teams but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4846977 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4846978 after you can say it is not good enough to win it okay but you have to accept levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries
4846979 we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4846980 i know we are not making the headlines with big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch
4846981 the loss is not a huge setback but we do have our heads down
4846982 china have the home crowd to back them and they have practiced a lot more on this turf than anyone else i think we need at least a draw against them and we will be ready
4846983 they just didn t stop believing they could win i saw it on their faces i was hoping they d get desperate but no
4846984 we agreed on the idea in principle if they want me to do this job i dont see a problem coming to help
4846985 it is up to them to make the next move i am not taking any job until december i told them i would agree on the idea with no fixed salary but to only get paid for the work which i do
4846986 there has to be a final agreement south african football association chief executive raymond hack keeps in touch they want to develop the idea
4846987 she is okay now thank god she is living a normal life with some precautions

4846989 it is highly unlikely that there will be anything today we will see tomorrow
4846990 our goal is to lead a democratic battle to re establish the legality the liberty and the return

4846993 we have asked for an autopsy before we pronounce his death
4846994 after getting specific treatment in a clinic he quietly left without telling the doctor and asked his driver to take him to a hotel
4846995 he remained missing until the body which had washed up on a beach in the middle of friday morning was found after identification to be his
4846996 now russia needs to honour that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4846997 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4846998 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4846999 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognises this reality

4847011 jesus shows that her faith is great and he cures her sick daughter
4847012 he has not come only for the people of israel
4847013 we also are called to evangelize beginning with the bread of the word for all without exception
4847014 we can fall into the temptation of only reaching out to the groups that are closest to us
4847015 the lord invites us according to this gospel passage to take risks like the canaanite woman did the discovery of the person of jesus made her ask for the scraps but the lord gave her much more the bread of the healing of her daughter

4847024 maternal love is apparent in the many sanctuaries dedicated to her
4847025 where god willing i will go in a month to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the marian apparitions that took place there
4847026 mary being assumed into heaven shows us the ultimate goal of our pilgrimage on earth she reminds us that our whole being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that those who live and die in love of god and neighbor will be transformed in the image of the glorious body of the risen christ the lord who humbles the proud and extols the lowly cf luke 1 51 52 this is what the virgin proclaims forever in the mystery of her assumption may you always be praised o virgin mary pray to the lord for us
4847027 as we celebrate the solemnity of the assumption of the blessed virgin we are invited to raise our eyes to heaven and contemplate mary the mother of jesus and our mother she who on earth believed in gods word is now glorified in body and soul
4847028 may marys prayers and example guide you always and renew your hearts in faith and hope may god grant you and your families abundant blessings of peace and joy
4847029 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4847030 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4847031 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4847032 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4847033 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4847034 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4847035 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4847036 id like to answer that question but it would probably be better if i waited until another day
4847037 this is something we have to discuss with the team

4847052 one of sarabhais main weaknesses is his vanity we wonder if it might be worthwhile inviting him during his next trip abroad to stop in geneva and perhaps washington for the full treatment by arms control and disarmament agency head ambassador william foster and his associates conceivably his emotional and somewhat irrational position on npt might be modified by such an exposure

4847056 india has been assiduously pursuing the matter of opening trade route across the loc and would continue to do so india is ready to commence cross loc trade but awaits pakistani willingness to implement the agreement reached in april 2005
4847057 we had emphasised to pakistan that they should not insist on procedural issues raised by them as that would tie up the whole issue in a morass of red tape and further delay the initiation of cross loc trade
4847058 in the process elements who have been opposed to normalisation of the situation in the sensitive state have also got an opportunity to misguide the people
4847059 i wasnt even sure i would take part in this olympics

4847063 both the government and the congress party are anxious to end the stalemate in jammu and kashmir and find an amicable solution
4847064 the separatists were on the lookout for such an opportunity in the valley and the government by sheer mishandling and by giving an impression of suffering from paralysis had given the separatists what they wanted there was no move to counter this separatist propaganda which had led to the present grim situation in the state
4847065 the government has been directionless in dealing with the situation and its policy has alienated people both in the jammu region and in the kashmir valley
4847066 india may defer a decision for several years however the political and military challenge posed by communist china will probably lead to an eventual indian decision to join the nuclear club
4847067 fears that it will eventually be overwhelmed by its more populous arab neighbours
4847068 sees a possibility that nuclear weapons may be required to defend the principle of neutrality
4847069 does not wish to lead a parade but might follow
4847070 escape clauses of treaty would prevent gop from being disadvantaged if it signed and goi did not and goi proceeded with development of nuclear weapons and means of delivery
4847071 has been perceived by india as a direct blow to its own prestige and political position and as a potential threat to its security
4847072 might be ready to test a nuclear weapons device in perhaps a years time
4847073 it is likely that india would feel compelled to seek missiles if they could not be procured india would have to undertake a prolonged development program for which its industrial base is not well suited
4847074 probably bring the issue of indias going nuclear to a head earlier than in the case of the other nuclear capable countries
4847075 although now lacking in the technical capabilities necessary for a nuclear weapons program pakistan would undoubtedly seek to acquire them a new pak alignment with communist china could result
4847076 to meet the political and security incentives that are at the root of the nuclear proliferation issue as it has arisen in india
4847077 recent discussion between the u s representative in geneva and his indian counterpart
4847078 the latter said explicitly that a non proliferation treaty would not be worth having if it focused on what he termed the hypothetical nth country problem rather than the real problem posed by communist chinas growing nuclear capability
4847079 military aid to strengthen indias defence against the communist chinese conventional threat
4847080 to make clear to india that she does not have to consider exploding a nuclear device to achieve recognition
4847081 collective alternatives to national deterrence involving a closer nuclear relationship with the u s
4847082 and is not likely to materialize before many years have passed if indeed it materializes at all
4847083 if the americans want to come to our aid against an attack by the chinese they will even if we dont sign the npt and if they dont want to come to our aid they wont even if we do sign the treaty
4847084 the need for such arrangements is the more urgent since an indian national nuclear program which may prove difficult to avoid could well have serious repercussions in two key allied countries germany and japan
4847085 it will be important to have developed a workable collective arrangement in europe which will meet german aspirations and by subsuming the u k s national capability set a useful example for japan before india goes nuclear
4847086 many of the strides that have been made in income growth have been offset by the job losses in construction and housing related sectors she said
4847087 so yes the housing bust is largely to blame and the result is the domino effect this is having on the remainder of the economy
4847088 keep in mind that we are now also having to deal with increased fuel and food prices she said
4847089 even though fuel is dropping slightly right now gas prices are still higher than they were a year ago urias continued
4847090 this will become even more evident when the complete numbers for 2008 are tabulated
4847091 this operation shows that isaf can strike against the insurgency leadership who threaten innocent afghans and attack isaf forces
4847092 he commanded large numbers of insurgent fighters and committed atrocities against afghan police officers who worked to improve the safety and stability of their country

4847132 this risk has been around for a long time and doctors know about it
4847133 medication guides go out with a prescription every time its refilled that makes sure patients see it
4847134 doctors will pay more attention to dear doctor letters if they just come out on occasion so they sort of imply oh my god this is something terrible

4847160 i will utter my judgments against israel concerning all their wickedness who have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and
4847161 i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction
4847162 flee from the midst of jerusalem for evil appeareth out of the north and great destruction
4847163 thus hath the lord said to the king of babylon hew ye down trees and cast a mount to pile up dirt and make a road up the walls
4847164 wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god

4847172 the epa is abandoning its mission by rushing a permit out the door for political expedience and ignoring the fact that it will emit massive quantities co2 and other pollutants
4847173 this permit is another example of the rush by the agencys political appointees to hand out gifts to industry before president bush leaves office

4847180 of the 245 patients this year at least 66 had the recommended vaccination while 14 had received at least one dose

4847183 over the past five to six years the nation has seen a spike in pertussis said dr richard tooker chief medical the centers for disease control and prevention says the united states has about 5 000 to 7 000 reported cases each year the incidence of the disease has been increasing steadily since the 1980s the vaccine has not been effective as long as was planned he said
4847184 the current strategy for prevention of hepatitis b which targets high risk groups for immunization has failed to have a significant impact on the incidence of disease
4847185 a large measles outbreak occurred in sri lanka from october 1999 through june 2000 gt 15 000 suspected cases were reported to the central epidemiological unit of the department of health services
4847186 recent measles outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations have highlighted the role of vaccine failure as a barrier to the elimination of measles
4847187 in 1991 in fukuoka japan a measles outbreak occurred in which we observed 15 cases of measles vaccine failure mvf
4847188 the rates of secondary immune response sir and secondary vaccine failure svf during a measles epidemic were evaluated in conclusion neither prior vaccination nor detectable sir ensures protective immunity
4847189 the occurrence of secondary vaccine failure and vaccine modified measles does not appear to be a major impediment to measles control in the united states but may lead to underreporting of measles cases and result in overestimation of vaccine efficacy in highly vaccinated populations
4847190 we conclude that secondary vaccine failures occur and that while primary failures account for most cases secondary vaccine failures contribute to the occurrence of measles cases in an epidemic
4847191 an outbreak of measles occurred among adolescents in corpus christi texas in the spring of 1985 even though vaccination requirements for school attendance had been thoroughly enforced
4847192 fourteen of 74 seronegative students all of whom had been vaccinated contracted measles

4847194 in a may 1975 outbreak 147 adolescents ages 12 to 19 years were identified as having measles by a physician or school nurse
4847195 but experts said though most children have been repeatedly vaccinated polio related paralysis has been on the rise
4847196 there are studies to show that in malnourished children the vaccine can be fatal it actually causes paralysis so it is contraindicated in undernourished population said sathyamala epidemiologist
4847197 at the present time in brazil and other countries in the americas the only cases of paralytic poliomyelitis due to poliovirus are caused by vaccine strains
4847198 following a high coverage regular immunization programme using the salk type trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine in late 1984 an outbreak of poliomyelitis with widespread circulation of poliovirus type 3 throughout the country was found a thorough surveillance revealed 9 sporadic cases with acute persisting paralysis all shown to be caused by poliovirus type 3

4847243 ich wollte mich selber stolz machen der jubel war nicht so geplant das war einfach nur freude
4847244 es gab keine m glichkeit ihn zu schlagen ich glaube er kann noch schneller laufen
4847245 er ist das gr te talent das ich je gesehen habe
4847246 wir waren bei dem turnier enormen schwankungen unterworfen auch einzelne spieler in ihrer form wir m ssen deshalb die k rperliche basis der spieler berdenken und ganz sicher auch verbessern denn wir m ssen uns eingestehen dass wir es nicht geschafft haben bei der em alle spieler auf ein niveau zu bringen
4847247 das unterschiedliche k rperliche niveau der spieler hing auch damit zusammen dass wir im vergleich zur wm eine woche weniger vorbereitung hatten diese woche aber h tten wir gut gebrauchen k nnen wir m ssen jetzt mit der liga besprechen wie wir das im hinblick auf s dafrika verbessern k nnen
4847248 wir m ssen auch berlegen ob wir nicht wieder den einen oder anderen leistungstest einschieben k nnen die haben wir im vergangenen jahr aus zeitmangel gar nicht mehr durchgef hrt ich wei dass das schwierig ist bei dem engen terminkalender der klubs aber wir m ssen dort den hebel ansetzen
4847249 ich habe extrem gute augen ich sehe den stempel des herstellers auf dem tischtennis ball obwohl er mit 150 km h auf mich zukommt und fast 4000 umdrehungen pro minute macht dadurch kann ich den spin und die rotation des balles vorhersehen
4847250 es gibt einen deutlichen zusammenhang zwischen timos sehleistung und seinen schl gen
4847251 ich muss den ball mit den augen genau verfolgen ihn genau an der richtigen stelle treffen nur so kann ich dem ball die rotation geben
4847252 ich wollte mit meiner vertragsverl ngerung auch zeigen dass ich hier verantwortung bernehmen will
4847253 ich w re ein schlechter fu baller wenn ich nicht in die nationalmannschaft wollte doch durch reden hat das noch keiner geschafft ich muss meine leistungen best tigen und da habe ich die latte letzte saison selbst sehr hoch gelegt
4847254 jetzt stehen wir gegen wolfsburg schon richtig unter druck aber das sind wir in bochum ja gewohnt
4847255 vor meinem letzten zug habe ich gedacht dass ich das rennen verloren habe und es vorbei ist aber es war die richtige entscheidung mit einem kleinen schnellen schwung anzuschlagen
4847256 nat rlich ist es rgerlich wenn man gold so knapp verpasst aber die freude ber silber berwiegt
4847257 nur ein beispiel die neuseel nder fahren pro trainingstag zweimal 25 kilometer davon sind unsere leute kilometerweit entfernt und sie meiden immer mehr regatten ich war damals in der saison alle zwei wochen am start nur so bekommst du wettkampf h rte rennen bei denen es dir schwarz vor augen wird die du dann aber trotzdem noch gewinnst kannst du im training nicht simulieren
4847258 wie ich geh rt habe wird der verband einen cheftrainer einstellen damit es endlich eine einheitliche trainings und wettkampf planung gibt
4847259 ich bin kein ausgebildeter trainer aber ich bin bereit den vorstand des deutschen ruderverbandes mit meinem wissen um diesen sport zu beraten in welcher funktion auch immer
4847260 quem decide o treinador n o vou ficar irritado de forma nenhuma pelo contr rio estou feliz que a sele o tenha vencido e se classificado para a semifinal
4847261 conversamos e ele me deu for a me parabenizou pela atua o
4847262 eu j sabia mas s avisei hoje horas antes do jogo todos t m de estar espertos
4847263 ele mais t mido coisa da personalidade precisava hoje de algu m que n o aceitasse tanto a marca o pois seria uma partida pegada
4847264 ele tem quatro anos a menos em rela o ao limite de idade para jogar a olimp ada isso faz muita diferen a

4847268 bom treinar com ela para ver o salto dela e como ela treina foi muito legal a experi ncia ela me contou que tamb m sente inseguran a tem medo e fica nervosa
4847269 a gente j se encontrou algumas vezes e com certeza seria timo v lo na vila ol mpica
4847270 n o tem problema vai ser legal ver todo o pessoal l
4847271 s pe o aos volunt rios que n o se aglomerem muito em volta dos jogadores pois s vezes atrapalha
4847272 ich dachte dass mich keiner mag wenn ich schlecht schwimme
4847273 der ganze druck und die sorgen in meinem kopf sind weg
4847274 o brasil sempre se caracterizou por um futebol lento que conduz a bola que toca muito bem e preciso respeitar seus jogadores eles t m muita qualidade e podem ganhar a partida a qualquer momento
4847275 a partida que todos n s desejamos jogar e que todo o mundo deseja ver pois s o sempre jogos lindos
4847276 todos sabemos que queira ou n o h rivalidade mas um jogo a mais eles tamb m jogaram na prorroga o est o cansados de atuar 120 minutos e n s tamb m assim portanto esperamos que as coisas aconte am a nosso favor
4847277 estou confiante para jogar e vou dar tudo de mim eu devo ag entar uns 60 ou 70 minutos fiquei duas semanas me preparando fisicamente
4847278 esta equipe tem fome de vit rias e uma excelente forma de entender o futebol e seguramente haver recompensas

4847321 there are two key issues first is leadership without strong visionary leadership no strategy will be executed effectively

4847323 quality and process improvement programs are like teaching people how to fish strategy maps and scorecards teach people where to fish
4847324 m ost management meetings get consumed with discussions about short term operational and tactical issues it is important to meet to discuss and solve operational problems but companies err when they devote all their time together for fire fighting and coping with near term issues the formal strategy execution system schedules strategy review meetings at a different time from operational review meetings in that way each meeting has its own frequency agenda information system and participation as best meets the goals for that meeting
4847325 e executive leadership pervades every stage of the management system throughout
4847326 in fact leadership is so important to the strategy management system that we make a rather bold claim that leadership is both necessary and sufficient for successful strategy execution the necessary condition comes from our experience with the more than one hundred enterprises around the world who have become members of the balanced scorecard hall of fame in every instance the ceo of the organizational unit implementing the new strategy management system led the processes to develop the strategy and oversee its implementation no organization reporting success with the strategy management system had an unengaged or passive leader

4847395 while international investing does involve a different set of risks
4847396 the cumulative impact of risk has been declining in recent years when compared in relative terms to domestic investing
4847397 a faltering u s engine of global growth will be replaced by several emerging market engines
4847398 when measured using purchasing power parity china and india each contributed more to global growth in 2007 than did the united states the european union and japan
4847399 a reduction in global trade and payment imbalances the return of more pronounced inflationary pressures and a more diversified allocation of investible funds around the world

4847413 when you have a long term uptrend excesses build up along the way we are witnessing a correction
4847414 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
4847415 commodities cant be completely immune to the fact that there is a global slowdown taking place
4847416 that doesnt mean we should abandon commodities for the next 5 years there are still very strong supply demand dynamics in place for the next few years
4847417 we dont think the long term bull market is over but we have left the phase where its just a one way ride

4847419 pe firms invested 450 million across 22 deals in the healthcare and pharma sector during the first six months of 2008 this compares with 120 million invested across 13 companies during the corresponding period in 2007
4847420 we are bullish on the healthcare segment including diagnostic chains and medical equipment and are currently evaluating companies to partner within this space
4847421 the medical technology market was worth about 2 7 billion in 2006 and is likely to cross 10 billion by 2012 with a growth rate of over 20 it is estimated that over 85 of medical devices and equipment are imported and the market is primarily dominated by mncs with the indian software and hardware strengths india will be a strong source for such products in emerging markets most mncs are currently sourcing their products from china through oem arrangements joint ventures or own manufacturing facilities given the overall increase in prices in china india could become a potential alternate sourcing centre for such mncs
4847422 earlier most hospitals in india were owned and run by trusts due to their legal structures regulations and a non profit business model they did not attract any pe funding however with the entry of private players like max healthcare fortis and apollo the sector began attracting more pe funding since these private players need a significant amount of funding to fuel their expansion plans pe firms have started viewing the amazing opportunity this sector provides while investments made within the healthcare industry are long term plans the risk is usually lesser unless of course the company invested in shuts down the returns allow us to almost triple our money in a period of 5 years before exiting the company
4847423 value creation takes longer in healthcare but once created it is sustainable so while pe firms in other sectors can exit within two to three years in healthcare pe firms need to wait for six to eight years to get the right value for money pe firms in healthcare definitely need to have patience to get the right value

4847436 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
4847437 kevin has a big role to fill and hes still got a lot to learn in becoming a big playmaker for us
4847438 last year when we lost shockey we did some more four wide receiver stuff when we got into passing downs we put steve smith in the tight end position and let him do some of the things that we tried to do with shockey well see how we manage but hopefully a whole lot wont change and well still use a lot of tight end formations kevin will have to step up
4847439 i played under as much pressure as i can during that super bowl

4847448 the essential premise of highway retailing is creating my kind of store an environment where customers can feel completely at home and relate with ease to the shopping experience
4847449 highways are always viable options for developers to set up townships as township development requires huge tracts of land

4847451 our paper will provide space to all since we cannot compete with the dailies for breaking news our reports will be more analytical pieces and commentaries
4847452 we invite politicians to send their articles for instance in this first print pkr information chief tian chua has written a piece for us
4847453 we dont have an incentive for people to stay poor not zero sum their gains as they move up do not come at our expense china fear that they will catch up so we will fall behind untrue china has improved its standard of living is by selling us stuff they can make more cheaply than we can which is good for both of us chinas success increases our success improves our lives

4847455 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases

4847458 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run

4847461 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level

4847477 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end

4847480 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4847481 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

4847483 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4847484 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4847485 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family

4847564 networking is something we do and not a service we have to buy
4847565 mayhill fowlers two big scoops first the obama comments then in early june when bill clinton lashed out at a vanity fair writer
4847566 networking is something we do and not a service we have to buy
4847567 this government will meet its responsibility to help those in need but policies that increase dependency break up families and destroy self respect are not progressive theyre reactionary despite our strides in civil rights blacks hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power
4847568 we knew we had six outs to get the ball in play
4847569 so what we lost one big deal weve got two more to play
4847570 probably one hit here and there and we manufactured a couple of runs and won a game but thats the first one of those
4847571 it was important to get this win especially in a short series like this
4847572 all oil and gas states surveyed not one instance of drinking water contamination in over one million frac jobs
4847573 the number of wheels isnt the main safety issue its speed and the size of vehicles
4847574 the city of portland and multnomah county both would like to do away with cars in their perfect commie world we would all ride bikes or take public subsidized transportation they also believe fervently in income redistribution take from me and give to the cool aid drinkers their latest plans are to provide health care for all school children thats anyone under 21 or living at home that is going to school and forcing all chain restaurants to publish content information including calories for every menu item they currently are feeding free lunch to any child that shows up at any city park and it goes on and on and on i would like to feed all of them at least one 50 caliber health pill
4847575 i was thinking of putting one on a six foot high platform so i can have decent water flow
4847576 instead the downstream water owner would have to identify that youre reducing their flow and then bring an action in water court to get you to stop
4847577 there are a few caveats here not everyone could use wood fuel heating as there isnt enough of it but for terraced houses it might be ok as they have chimneys and are suited to solid fuel heating bigger homes would probably benefit from heat pumps or similar which just need a bit of electricity to drive them its not a perfect solution either my pv system is undersized and i will need to add more panels to give me enough power to run the things i need to run which will mean more cost and electric cooking is not the most carbon efficient although you can get induction hobs which are more efficient than normal ones and were on a 100 green tarriff for the grid electricity we do use if the sun doesnt shine that means tepid showers rather than a nice hot bath when you feel like it not something everyone would want
4847578 even in the cloudy uk more electricity than the nation currently uses could be generated by putting pv roof tiles on all suitable roofs

4847581 there is a great deal of human nature in people
4847582 proportion of the amount of revenue generated through fares by its paying customers as a fraction of the cost of its total operating expenses
4847583 there is plenty of oil we just have to drill for it
4847584 the citys chief information officer will develop a baseline measurement of energy consumption and
4847585 those who make projections for budget revenues believe that the good times will be back and continue to show optimistic projections
4847586 in the strong mayor form the mayor is given almost total administrative authority and a clear wide range of political independence with the power to appoint and dismiss department heads without council approval and little public input in this system the strong mayor prepares and administers the city budget although that budget often must be approved by the city council in some strong mayor governments the mayor will appoint a chief administrative officer or cao who will supervise department heads prepare the budget and coordinate departments this cao sometimes also called a city manager is responsible only to the mayor the government of new york city uses the strong mayor form of the mayor council system as indeed do most major american cities
4847587 whereas in most cities city councilpersons have little control over civil servants
4847588 even in strong mayoral systems it is not the city boss kind of system that once prevailed in machine cities
4847589 they may have staff that do the budget who are under the control of the entire council
4847590 the city of maribyrnong is 31 2 sq km in area and has a population of over 63 000 it the smallest and most densely populated municipality in the metropolitan area the city of maribyrnong borders melbourne which is australias second largest city and victorias capital city this central location provides easy access to all the benefits of melbourne such as the ports the best road network in australia and an extensive public transport system
4847591 theyre interested in the fact that they can help the environment reduce their carbon footprint and saving money also theres a camaraderie thats being developed
4847592 that puts them just that much farther away from where they work
4847593 roto tillers are far less efficient per work done than a car
4847594 we could save millions of barrels of oil per year simply with modern scheduling
4847595 what will we do that doesnt involve our suburban denali escalade and 70 miles one way
4847596 gosh forbid we might have to talk to each other again
4847597 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
4847598 come to me all you who are weary and i will give you rest
4847599 we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail
4847600 i will also say that watching the post results speeches that romney looked more presidential and was more inspiring and energizing in defeat than mccain in victory
4847601 no that is straight talk no that is straight talk no that is straight talk
4847602 cant imagine bill clinton in the white house again with nothing to do

4847608 we are targeting accounting fraud insider trading and deceptive sales practices
4847609 these investigations may well lead to other instances of fraud from investment banks and private equity firms to hedge funds
4847610 the tragedy of ignorance is that you do not know what you do not know
4847611 give a man a dollar and the money will soon be spent but give him the knowledge on how to save that dollar and he will then become wealthy
4847612 i took the photo in this little village in the middle of sicily a village in which the height of technical sophistication was most likely the telephone and where farmers use their tractors and tiny powered garden carts as their method of transportation to drive to the village
4847613 its a floor wax its a dessert topping it does julienne fries
4847614 another key factor is the fact that people recognize the broad use of open xml in the market as seen by the hundreds of independent implementations of ecma 376

4847630 the inflation has many causes from rising global demand for commodities to the monetary constraints of currencies pegged to the weakening american dollar but one cause is the skyrocketing price of oil itself which has quadrupled since 2002 it is helping push many ordinary people toward poverty even as it stimulates a new surge of economic growth in the gulf

4847632 andbusiness continuity planning is a must for companies of all sizes a small firm that loses all its data will go out of business just as surely as a larger one
4847633 if anything smaller firms become more vulnerable to crises because larger companies are geographically more diverse knocking out your operations in say edinburgh is not as business critical when your offices in london can take some of the overload
4847634 frequently well find small companies that have thought about continuity issues but not implemented them fully
4847635 on our initial audit well find for example that it back ups have indeed been taken but the tapes are sitting next to the computer and the coffee cups its frightening too the number of times you find that checking the tapes has not gone on the procedures have never been tested
4847636 is that irrespective of the size of your business you can go a long way to devising a plan simply by getting your senior staff to think through the issues
4847637 producing future workers in the economies of our countries who are able to think critically is the point this cannot be accomplished without the use of the tools there are many who are concerned about the widening digital divide or as i like to say the wrinkles
4847638 i think we have to listen to kids i think we have to listen a lot they shouldnt be totally empowered but they should be heard thinking that the teacher has all the answers is misguided in fact some of my best teaching has been a result of asking the right questions and listening

4847642 but if you or i went as non native americans consumers the tax on the product would have already been paid on the wholesale level and they would not be entitled to a refund of that tax under this bill because you and i are not tribal members
4847643 we are demonstratively a contributor to the economy and that is what our treaties would protect
4847644 the 5 000 jobs we have created through gaming or through our tobacco trade really all gets spent in western new york albanys effort to take that money and redistribute it downstate is probably not something most people realize that they are going to appreciate
4847645 we want all of our brands sold through legitimate distribution channels with taxes paid laws respected
4847646 for us also in the absence of collecting the tax the state can come back and look to raise excise taxes again

4847694 akhil had fought with him and knew his style i could not sleep at all last night and i did not let akhil sleep either we chatted how to go about todays bout and he kept telling me i have to win
4847695 i fought like him and won in the ring i would often look at him and he would signal me how to go about it
4847696 jitender is a very promising boxer and would go a long way i have been boasting that i would not settle for anything less than gold but to be honest i have more faith in jitenders capabilities
4847697 winning the gold this week the biggest fear for me has been not to go down the road of guys who have won medals earlier and struggled to keep the intensity
4847698 fear has been a part of every athlete but i think i have all the faith to be relaxed i realise that my own expectations are always higher than anyone elses so i set a higher standard than any journalist coach or friend
4847699 i dont know yet who knows i may take a shot at taking part in 50 metre air rifle prone or three positions

4847702 quite a few people came up to me at beijing airport people who didnt have chinese accents and knew who i was

4847704 i had the choice to quit or keep playing and it was a hard decision

4847715 ive been thinking about that note too and i guess its kind of hard to say what a man is thinking in that condition but i think it was a kind of confession i think he meant to say that human beings can carry on two lives at the same time perhaps are two different people at different times
4847716 i dont think that mr cassidy had the money to pay you dad and was ashamed to face you i heard his foreman say that he hadnt been paid their wages for months thats what i think the note means what should i put down in the notebook dad

4847732 i noticed when we returned from nagano all of a sudden our sport had credibility
4847733 if we carried a hockey bag into the arena people didnt look at us funny and there was now a respect to our sport its been growing steadily since then
4847734 then in my freshman year we found out womens hockey was being talked about for the olympics
4847735 i was saying to my mom as we went to the opening ceremonies i want to be an olympian and i want to represent the usa and how can i do it
4847736 there was no womens hockey and im a 15 year old kid thinking i can conquer the world
4847737 this has been a dream for all the women who played hockey im just happy to have watched and been a part of that huge growth

4847754 the federal trade commission ftc has two routes for challenging a merger it can seek a preliminary injunction in federal court which if granted usually kills the deal and it also may conduct an administrative trial in front of an ftc administrative law judge or alj
4847755 last august the ftc lost its bid for a preliminary injunction in federal court and the deal closed but a few weeks ago that decision was reversed and the matter was sent back to the lower court by announcing that it is resuming the administrative trial the ftc may be trying to increase the pressure on whole foods it may signal that the ftc will push for a decision by the alj rather than waiting for the district court to revisit the matter
4847756 the ftc probably thinks it has a better chance with the alj than with the federal district court judge but the big issue remains what meaningful remedy is there if the ftc wins the merger was consummated one year ago stores have been sold or closed and wild oats no longer exists as an independent competitor
4847757 we won two rowing gold medals in barcelona and two in atlanta but not in the space of such a short time

4847762 the secret apprentice has been sent by darth vader to hunt down and destroy the general but is also told that in order to remain a secret he is to leave no witnesses
4847763 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4847764 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4847765 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4847766 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4847767 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4847768 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4847769 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4847770 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4847771 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4847772 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm

4847781 the percentage of american children living apart from their biological fathers will reach 50 in the next century
4847782 its unique and visually stunning it also has the added bonus of meshing well with the previous ads chevy ran for the cobalt linking together with the common theme of having a personified car
4847783 i learned that that they exist i was part of the consumer base that wasnt aware of the fact that chevy made things other than trucks
4847784 a better question would be what wouldnt make me want to buy a chevy car
4847785 you know you are in trouble when you are losing out to big waffle
4847786 i feel like an oscar nominee being one of the five finalists its true what they say that its an honor just to be nominated everything has happened so fast since our team found out we were finalists that i cant say it feels any other way than ridiculous and surreal
4847787 a contest like this is representative of the american dream especially for us college kids and chevrolet is americas brand you could say its a match made in heaven
4847788 it was great to have this opportunity i was so excited that i got to be on the set when the ad for the hhr was filmed the car and the set were really cool i really enjoyed it all meeting the other finalists learning about the production process from chevy from music selection to editing it was all fascinating and now to see the final ad on tv its been an amazing experience
4847789 this is one scandal the national enquirer has not reported no babies with mystery fathers no former vice presidential candidates cowering in a hotel basement to escape the paparazzi this scandal relegated to the business pages if covered at all is un juicy compared to laffaire edwards with a wife betrayed children humiliated hypocrisy exposed it is a small wonder after the ethical hemming and hawing that the big time publishers and broadcasters jumped in to take part in the fun yet entertainment value aside the edwards scandal directly affected almost nobody but the edwards family and a few disillusioned followers the bear stearns conspiracy scandal affected and continues to affect tens of thousands of people in all sorts of ways as the story lacked prurient interest it was left to bloomberg com to unearth persuasive information that the wall street firm was seemingly brought down by a conspiracy that netted its participants a profit of upwards of 250 million on an investment of 1 7 million in a week or so nice work if you can get it
4847790 our current way of life is unsustainable we are the first species that will have to self consciously impose limits on ourselves if we are to survive tonight i want to argue that the way in which we humans have long imagined the future must be rethought as the scope and depth of the cascading crises we face become painfully clearer day by day put simply were in trouble on all fronts and the trouble is wider and deeper than most of us have been willing to acknowledge we should struggle to build a road on which we can walk through those troubles if such a road is possible but i doubt its going to look like any path we had previously envisioned nor is it likely to lead anywhere close to where most of us thought we were going whatever our individual conception of the future we all should re evaluate the assumptions on which those conceptions have been based this is a moment in which we should abandon any political certainties to which we may want to cling given humans failure to predict the place we find ourselves today i dont think thats such a radical statement as we stand at the edge of the end of the ability of the ecosystem in which we live to sustain human life as we know it what kind of hubris would it take to make claims that we can know the future

4847793 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4847794 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4847795 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
4847796 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4847797 we are worried that we are facing under the strong arm of russia a situation where some kind of understanding would be reached that russia would be given a free hand in the region
4847798 amazing its like a rollercoaster ride that you hope never ends lovin every minute of it
4847799 we wanted chevy to be relatable something everyone has a best friend we wanted people to know that with chevy you not only get a car but a friend by joining the revolution
4847800 i think its an amazing opportunity for everyone involved the students get exposure and chevy gets an insight into a young demographic
4847801 a great ad that i can relate to and knowing that the company gets me
4847802 i thought it was a great idea for chevy to put this competition together because they want to focus on the younger consumers and theres not a better way to do that than to have them help you with it and make it for you this way it shows what they are really thinking and look for and i think it was a great idea plus they got free ideas and research cant beat that
4847803 i learned a lot about chevy cars this weekend most people think they arent reliable like foreign cars and they use more gas but i learned that they are very high quality very functional great with gas mileage and also have great features like remote start and ipod hookups
4847804 my partner and i worked so hard for this ad challenge so i was really happy being one of the finalists im proud of it and enjoyed a lot its really a great experience for me
4847805 our team started with free associations in a caf we wrote down many words from association about what chevy is and developed our concept
4847806 great advertising is about taking risks i can see more and more companies using consumer generated advertising because it adds a fresh perspective and generates buzz which is always good for product awareness
4847807 they are more cool and trendy than i had imagined
4847808 celebrity influence hearing and seeing chevrolet portrayed in a younger way
4847809 its exciting to have even made it this far in fact im proud to see that my ideas and art are good enough to pass in the business of advertising it also gives me confidence that after school i might not have to wait tables all week long
4847810 im still trying to get my head around how lucky me and my team are to have been chosen it makes my heart smile yes it can do that and my arms tingle a little bit that may sound weird but the feeling is difficult to describe in words i want to jump up and down and yell nonsensical phrases such as wooooo hoooo and yeee haaaw just so i can release some energy and excitement inside
4847811 i see there being a general movement in advertising towards content influenced by social networking websites such as ifilm newgrounds and of course myspace the internet has broken down the barriers between consumer and producer and allowed us normal people to be both at the same time we can buy the products we like and express that genuine feeling of value and utility to peers in a way that is more effective than the broadcast model of old i think chevy understands the concept of being adaptive and learning from their consumer base the risk would be to ignore the trends in culture that are empowering the individual to become better informed and have their word heard
4847812 customizable options the ability to reconfigure the inside to meet specific yet unique needs are definitely cool features are you listening chevy
4847813 ive been watching the super bowl ever since i can remember if the packers werent in it my family would have a party just to watch commercials after a while you just have a knack of knowing super bowl commercials i basically took an ideology that i think that car commercials need to start incorporating and i got my commercial
4847814 i like the way they drive and i like the companys ideas and motivations behind each of the cars they seem to have a centered goal and i think there is a car for every kind of driver which i like i also love the fact that the new car crossover line all get above 30 mpg on the highway
4847815 it feels absolutely incredible it has solidified for me the fact that i want to go into advertising
4847816 my partner and i test drove cars conducted interviews with people at the local chevy dealership did secondary research online and finally sat for many many hours concepting and coming up with ideas that tied in with all the information we had found out
4847817 it seems that if consumers are going to be the ones watching the ads then they are also the ones who could best tell chevy what they would like to see to me all ads are consumer driven they are produced with the consumer in mind why not take the chance of letting consumers create the ads
4847818 i have learned that chevy truly is an all american brand their cars are affordable visually appealing and loaded with features and benefits
4847819 by the time they get to the last few weeks of american idol when theyre down to the ten finalists you know quite a few things you know those ten finalists have all launched a career in the music industry you know their names their state and quite a bit about them as people you like some of them better than others it hardly matters who wins all the finalists are famous remember clay aiken didnt win the chevy super bowl college ad challenge is like that theres no doubt that anna pogosova loulou quintela and kelly sherman as well as the other eight students who were finalists have all launched their careers in the advertising industry
4847820 wow i feel like the dream ive been working so hard for is finally starting to pay off regardless of the outcome i know that it will greatly aid me in starting my career this march

4847828 president bush why dont you shut up in your statement on monday regarding the legitimate actions of the russian federation in georgia you failed to mention the war crimes perpetrated by georgian military forces which american advisors support against russian and ossetian civilians
4847829 president bush why dont you shut up your american transport aircraft gave a ride home to thousands of georgian soldiers from iraq directly into the combat zone
4847830 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green

4847881 it is not however as though olevian envisioned that christians would have a perfect faith in this life there remains in every believer a part of the soul which remains unregenerate or not dominated by the knowledge of god in that portion of the soul terrors of the conscience will continue to afflict the faithful nevertheless the believer ought to fight against such doubts and rest on the promise of god that he will never leave his people for this reason christ has instituted the means of grace to strengthen the infirmity of our faith
4847882 for canisius a roman catholic theologian contemporary of olevian like the medieval intellectualist tradition justification is an ontological matter an essential transformation of the soul from the state of sin to the state of grace therefore according to his doctrine of god the beginning of justice was sufficient to satisfy god the assumption behind the condign merit scheme was that god holds his judgement in abeyance until final justification or sanctification is achieved
4847883 the impious are justified as the merit of the passion of our lord jesus christ is communicated to them and not as something is accomplished legally or extrinsically
4847884 just as adams sin was transfused into all humanity so also ones sanctification must be the very stuff of justification it is the pouring forth of the love of god into the hearts of those who are being justified
4847885 as a corollary to his understanding of adams federal headship he believed that the righteousness which is imputed to believers was not only christs i e his suffering and crucifixion but also his active obedience to the divine law
4847886 together justification and sanctification comprise the this theme in his soteriology corresponded to his definition of sin sin is twofold original and actual the twofold benefits of christ address both
4847887 summer is the time for blockbuster movies and it seems for talking up war with iran five years ago after baghdad fell so easily hard liners were talking about pushing the fight on to tehran two years ago israel and hezbollah fought a proxy war leading to speculation that their patrons the united states and iran respectively might well find themselves on the battlefield last year iran was testing missiles and the bush administration was taking a tough line about irans move toward nuclear proliferation this year with the end of george bushs presidency close at hand speculation is rife that israel with tacit or explicit american assistance might seize the opportunity to bomb iranian nuclear installations before a new and possibly less sympathetic president takes office
4847888 it got harder and harder to work with city government
4847889 funding was always a problem without resources people start fading away

4847894 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4847895 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4847896 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4847897 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4847898 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4847899 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4847900 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4847901 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
4847902 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
4847903 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4847904 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4847905 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4847906 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4847907 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4847908 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4847909 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4847910 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4847911 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4847912 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4847913 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4847914 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4847915 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4847916 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4847917 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4847918 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4847919 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4847920 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4847921 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4847922 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4847923 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4847924 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4847925 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4847926 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4847927 this is a planning took where all things are going
4847928 i am still getting the same rhetoric that i was getting two years ago
4847929 it doesnt take sherlock holmes to figure it out this whole thing stinks
4847930 a few have now been put off buying in cyprus when they heard what happened to me
4847931 im not going to stay quiet any more and watch other people lose their savings im sleeping in a tent thats what i got for my 75 000 ive lost my home but im not moving from here until i let everyone know what a corrupt society cyprus is
4847932 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4847933 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4847934 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4847935 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4847936 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4847937 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4847938 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4847939 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4847940 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4847941 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4847942 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4847943 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4847944 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4847945 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4847946 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4847947 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4847948 i dropped it into a good lie where i didnt have too many options
4847949 i had a good lie to flop it honestly i was thinking to try and get it about 10 feet past the hole and make that putt for par
4847950 im to a point now where ive gotten myself in this position or around this position and im getting more comfortable
4847951 i put a new putter in play a few weeks ago and since then i have made just about everything ive looked at
4847952 its happened every so often im the type of putter that when they start going in i tend to make a whole lot im really streaky ive always made a lot of putts from inside eight feet and i seem to have it close from outside 15 to 20 feet once that first one goes in they all seem to start going in
4847953 ive had a lot of good things going on the last few weeks it just keeps building and building
4847954 all the hard work is finally coming into its own
4847955 im in a good position but obviously i need to get off to a good start and put some pressure on the leaders
4847956 its hard work on this tour there are so many good players out here i know that every shot could make a big difference for the rest of my life
4847957 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4847958 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4847959 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4847960 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4847961 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4847962 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4847963 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4847964 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4847965 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4847966 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4847967 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4847968 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4847969 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4847970 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4847971 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4847972 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4847973 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4847974 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4847975 iraq appears not to have come to genuine acceptance u2014 not even today u2014 of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and live in peace u201d
4847976 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4847977 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4847978 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4847979 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4847980 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4847981 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4847982 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4847983 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4847984 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4847985 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4847986 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4847987 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4847988 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4847989 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4847990 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4847991 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4847992 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4847993 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4847994 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4847995 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4847996 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4847997 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4847998 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4847999 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4848000 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4848001 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4848002 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4848003 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4848004 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4848005 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4848006 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4848007 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4848008 they knew going in what was going to happen maybe in some respects i was provoked
4848009 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4848010 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4848011 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4848012 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4848013 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4848014 its no surprise that our members are seeing big problems with youth alcohol use in their communities
4848015 more honestly reflects the harm caused by alcohol and tobacco
4848016 asked 29 consultant psychiatrists who specialise in addiction to rate 20 drugs of abuse in nine categories three of these related to physical harm three to the likelihood of addiction and three to social harms such as healthcare costs

4848031 one of the big problems when they bought may was they bought a midwest company mainly and midwest tastes tend to be more basic more price oriented more promotionally oriented

4848036 ive been doing this for over 30 years and ive never seen anything like this
4848037 the structured finance market is so bleak right now it makes sense for us to focus our energies on this

4848058 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
4848059 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky

4848087 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means that the pandemic virus must already exist period end of discussion

4848099 every church makes a choice in how to respond to the pop culture and the choice it makes determines how much of an impact it will have on its community
4848100 in the new testament only the gospels were written with the general public in mind yet many in the church read pop culture in light of peter paul and johns letters books of the bible intended as inhouse documents designed to purify gods people have been used inappropriately to correct the broader culture so the warnings against sexual immorality in 1 corinthians 7 get directed toward audiences paul never intended

4848292 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4848293 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4848294 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4848295 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4848296 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
4848297 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

4848356 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
4848357 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all
4848358 it has always been my opinion that the michigan delegation would have a full vote at the convention
4848359 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
4848360 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
4848361 michigan and florida did suffer through this process its not as though they werent held responsible for the decision to move their primaries up
4848362 we had a circular firing squad and everyone fired their weapon fortunately no one was hit and now weve decided to move on
4848363 its kind of like a highly mythic dear abby experience
4848364 there is a shared feeling of disappointment that this has become necessary
4848365 but even as people share their disappointment the vast majority also recognizes the necessity for difficult decisions and hope by addressing these lingering issues head on that we will get to the point where the city will be more stable financially

4848394 the standard is not whether ebay could reasonably anticipate possible infringement
4848395 but rather whether ebay continued to supply its services to sellers when it knew or had reason to know of infringement by those sellers here when tiffany put ebay on notice of specific items that tiffany believed to be infringing ebay immediately removed those listings
4848396 the law does not impose liability for contributory trademark infringement on ebay for its refusal to take such preemptive steps in light of ebays reasonable anticipation or generalized knowledge that counterfeit goods might be sold on its website quite simply the law demands more specific knowledge as to which items are infringing and which seller is listing those items before requiring ebay to take action
4848397 we have to demonstrate that the injunctions are not technically realistic and are impossible to execute
4848398 lvmh group do not intend to hold off enforcing the injunction
4848399 the commercial court finding that ebays sites were subject to french law because they were accessible from france
4848400 i thought once it has been purchased that it is no longer the property of the manufacturer but now the purchaser how are they trying to take ownership of something they do not own anymore
4848401 as of this morning if one visited those sites ebay com and ebay fr in france a significant number of the perfumes appear for sale that is not in compliance with the injunction
4848402 we are actively working towards finding an effective solution we will comply as technically and humanly possible i will keep you posted when we have some news to share in this direction
4848403 on ebay com the us site nothing seems to be blocked since when i entered christian dior perfume kenzo perfume or givenchy perfume in the search box dozens of auctions came up
4848404 on the french ebay site ebay fr the same searches using both perfume and parfum produces 0 results for each of the brands so some blocking must be happening however at the bottom of those same search results pages theres a box with links to ebay boutiques outside france us uk and canada mainly but i also saw spain that offer perfumes by the three sic producers for auction
4848405 mr reinhard and mr kreinberg acknowledge participating in discussions which were not authorized by nor disclosed to dows board concerning a potential lbo of dow and that the actions taken by dows board were appropriate under the circumstances
4848406 acknowledges mr reinhard and mr kreinbergs substantial contributions to dow over their lengthy and illustrious careers at dow
4848407 pedro reinhard is pleased with the settlement he has served as a loyal and committed employee and board member of dow chemical and has served its shareholders for many years the dispute with his former company and colleagues was distressing to him personally and he greatly appreciates the companys public recognition and kind words about his illustrious career at the company
4848408 this was a very important piece of litigation for the company and for the board the company is very pleased with the fact it has been resolved in this way
4848409 its fair to say were pleased that what had been a disappointing chapter in dows history has been closed and that the boards swift and decisive action in april 2007 has been vindicated
4848410 they didnt have to talk about constitutional issues at all it seems like a signal to the lower courts that they intend to take this 1 1 line which was first drawn in state farm v campbell much more seriously than they have been in prior cases
4848411 w hen compensatory damages are substantial then a lesser ratio perhaps only equal to compensatory damages can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee
4848412 that exxon knowingly allowed a relapsed alcoholic repeatedly to pilot a vessel filled with millions of gallons of oil through waters that provided the livelihood for the many plaintiffs in this case given that conduct it was only a matter of time before a crash and spill like this occurred
4848413 would not support exxon in any way shape form or fashion ever
4848414 oh what do you do with a drunken sailor what do you do with a drunken sailor make him the captain of an exxon tanker early in the morning
4848415 scruggs said in an interview on march 30 2006 that he plans to share with hood documents from a highly placed state farm source he had flown to bloomington a week earlier to pick up a package from the source
4848416 they gave me a bunch of good stuff and im going through it now and turning it over to the attorney general he said state farms fraser engerman declined to comment
4848417 to the extent that they were provided by individuals who are his clients or former clients
4848418 i let him in the computer and i cant speak after that
4848419 is based upon the misguided premise that gbm and bfrg are vicariously responsible for acts about which they had no or incomplete knowledge and did not in any way direct
4848420 i have not received nor do i have any agreement to receive any compensation from any source as a result of my involvement as a facilitator
4848421 the most egregious conduct by state farm i accepted the offer to be involved in the case and to have sic offered to do so on a pro bono basis
4848422 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4848423 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4848424 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4848425 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4848426 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4848427 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4848428 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4848430 if youre running a business of any sort you have to care about the software and business method patents
4848431 i often run into patents on statistical methods and mathematical algorithms of the type that i implement
4848432 i dont think i violate the ones ive seen but i could be wrong and i dont know what else is out there thats the thing that really woke me up by doing pure math i face legal liability as far as i know thats a first in human history
4848433 and said we really want to fund your work and he said yes
4848434 pretty much every argument we make top to bottom applies to business methods as well
4848435 we have another pick your brain request this one comes from barracuda networks the email and web security appliances company but its about an attack on clamav the open source antivirus product barracuda includes clamav in some of its enterprise solutions although its a small part of what barracuda does and trend micro has accused clamav of infringing a patent it owns 5 623 600 it specifically has named barracuda spam firewall the barracuda web filter and the barracuda im firewall as infringing trend micro has been trying to get barracuda to either pay license royalties for including clamav or stop using clamav in its products barracuda however is an open invention network licensee and it decided to stand up and defend clamav against what it views as a bogus claim barracuda believes the patent is questionable at best and believes there is prior art to be found so it decided to defend clamav on behalf of the community and it asks for our help in finding prior art
4848436 also the parallel concept that software should be free will only make sense when software writers agree to work for free

4848457 if you want to know the honest truth the only reason why i wanted to write on any blog was to spread the gospel of classical music to persuade and convert citizens of this planet to the best music around recommending new pieces to those of us who are still developing their admiration for this music is one of the best ways of shedding light on the shaded corners of composers we know and potentially brand new composers my list like fogels or carstensens is a personal assessment of music that i listen to that other people might not recognize right away im convinced of their worth and i hope you will to

4848462 theres a big difference between the nationwide car and the cup car
4848463 i mean the cup car goes a lot faster down the straightaway but a lot slower through the corners
4848464 so you really just have to get accustomed to rolling in a little easier than the nationwide car but youve got to get back in the gas really soon because of all that power
4848465 ive got to get used to going 400 miles instead of 300 miles like in the nationwide series

4848477 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4848478 one of the great things to come out of these olympic games is that the tremendous use of our digital properties online and the great viewership online and the tremendous number of page views is really teaching us a tremendous amount about what people want to consume great content and so we re going to come out of these olympics with great digital knowledge and hopefully we ll be able to turn those digital pennies into digital if not dollars digital 50 cent pieces at some point

4848532 we started to see patients in our second semester of our second year the way we now introduce clinical medicine on the first day of medical school hopefully helps students get a lot of practice from day one
4848533 i didnt know what it meant to be an intern until my fourth year
4848534 i had two really great senior residents who took me under their wing
4848535 in the beginning youre overwhelmed orthodontics was like learning a whole new language for me because in my dental school orthodontics was not the primary focus
4848536 you see patients at age 11 and then all of a sudden the little boy youre treating is suddenly taller than you
4848537 its a major source of accomplishment in my life right now
4848538 youre spending so much time with them and theyre there because they want to be just like you one day
4848539 i was the one who you may remember making a bit of a scene one time in the middle of our literature review class
4848540 at the time i could not understand why we took so much time reviewing these studies i have learned many a thing this year but if i could pinpoint one thing i have truly perfected it would be my ability to evaluate literature i wanted to personally thank you for not reprimanding me at the time of my outrage i now truly understand the importance of this and often think back to my attack of literature evaluation and wonder how i was so na ve
4848541 it might take 10 000 hours to learn to play the violin
4848542 it can take 10 times as long to learn how to be an expert in your field
4848543 the humane society offers many wonderful programs and services necessary for the safety and welfare of animals and their human partners
4848544 we are excited about supporting a cause that is close to our hearts and helps build a strong and caring community
4848545 we are so appreciative of the support lwr communities gives to the humane society not only to paw partners but the support we receive from sondra guffey who sits on our board of directors
4848546 mid county has been so supportive not only of the humane society in general but of the black tie and tails gala in particular i would like to thank all corporate sponsors lakewood ranch volunteers and future sponsors
4848547 we wanted to look at our experience with these burns because it appeared to us anecdotally that we were treating a fair number of children with burns isolated to the feet
4848548 we felt that there may be a pattern that could be identified that would lead us to potentially develop prevention strategies
4848549 clearly theyre not going to have this problem in manhattan where most people dont even have space for a backyard
4848550 i think this is a problem in rural areas with warm weather because it tends to be more common to burn trash and leaves in the backyard in these areas
4848551 the study is a great review of these burn cases because it shows how the origins of these injuries tend to be region specific
4848552 we see about two to three cases a month and in about half of the instances the accidents occurred on the beach from kids running over ashes and hot sand that were supposed to extinguish a bonfire
4848553 the classic story is that a 2 year old goes running outside through the ashes without footwear and gets burned
4848554 in many cases parents burned yard trimmings or trash and didnt put water on the underlying coals to properly extinguish the fire they just thought it was out because there werent open flames any longer
4848555 parental supervision is paramount and proper closed footwear is also very important in the presence of a fire
4848556 but the best preventative modality is to learn how to extinguish the fires appropriately the best resource that tells you how to do that is the handbook
4848557 this is a great opportunity for residents to see businesses and meet business owners all under one roof
4848558 this isnt uncommon for businesses to come together for a good cause everytime we do this kind of event we receive excellent response from all of the participants
4848559 its actually a pretty scary feeling to have to trust someone else completely for your safety
4848560 we at southeastern guide dogs appreciate the generosity and time put in by the merchants at lakewood ranch to help us showcase what a wonderful organization this is
4848561 you know i was never 100 percent healthy last year
4848562 you dont want to get too much into percentages because then it becomes a big issue but i was never close to 100 percent i felt like last year i was just really trying to prepare my body for the next week this year coming into this offseason i worked with the new trainers and worked a lot on strengthening the core the back the lower legs and getting my legs under me and as a result coming into this camp i truly finally felt 100 percent and ready to roll
4848563 i think hes really in a great place physically and mentally
4848564 he finished up the season with three really strong games and maintained that type of play through our mini camp and otas and the offseason program and it has carried into training camp
4848565 he came into camp in great shape and hes the team leader and hes handled that with great responsibility and grace hes unique he has that great sense of humor where he can be the funniest guy on the bus at the same time when he needs to crank it up he can get after you a little bit to have a leader like that from a head coaching stand point you cannot get enough of that
4848566 i think with kevin curtis second year in the system reggie brown having another year under his belt of working with me as well as the rest of the offense having lj smith back healthy pays dividends for us on the offense side and also having brian westbrook lorenzo booker and correll buckhalter at the running back position is huge for us we have some depth its very important for us and we want to use that to our advantage we just have to continue to stay together let the chemistry flow and put up as many points as we can
4848567 i cannot say enough good things about 5 mcnabbs number
4848568 weve become friends hes taught me so much about the quarterback position ive learned so much
4848569 definitions are conjectures since mathematics does not have a foundation according to lakatos there are no primitive terms terms properly singled out as undefined and so defined expressions cannot be eliminated unpacked into a preferred set of primitives
4848570 do our brains undergo the same processes to point to the concept of the signum function
4848571 its not going to help us none because we cant put but two cars on the track at a time
4848572 its going to be an advantage to have two teams but not four but it hurts a four car organization like hendrick that has four cars
4848573 i like to listen to leah dizon because shes sexy
4848574 michelle and barack married in 1992 and have two children malia ann and natasha whats more they genuinely seem to love each other if barack obama is elected they may be the first first couple to actually have sex with each other since the kennedy administration and maybe even earlier
4848575 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
4848576 we are at a critical moment in our nations history the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need barack obama is a leader to move america in a new direction and bring us together to turn moments of great challenge into moments of great opportunity this years democratic convention is the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
4848577 just as the obama campaign uses the energy and passion of grassroots volunteers combined with state of the art technology to bring people into their positive campaign for change so will the 2008 convention use the voices of the people through technology and innovative programming to lay out barack obamas vision and policies for how to move america in a new direction

4848581 michelle obama visited with virginia military spouses this morning in norfolk virginia where she participated in a roundtable discussion and learned about the challenges these military spouses face balancing work family and regular relocations while also coping with their loved ones serving in the military far from home
4848582 michelle is speaking out about the john mccain campaign ad that likened her husband barack to a celebrity on the order of paris hilton
4848583 its funny to have anybody characterize barack as an elitist you know this is the kid who was raised by a single mother who didnt have access to many resources who you know has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community this guy you know he personifies all of what you know we hope that our kids can be
4848584 with an item reporting the other day on the huge tyra banks pretending to be michelle obama for a monthly magazine story that broke during the night
4848585 there were a lot of things time wise that he couldnt provide because he was not there so how do i stop being
4848586 i also had to admit that i needed space and i needed time and the more time that i could get to myself the less stress i felt so it was a growth process for me individually and for us as a couple he had to grow too
4848587 its a unit that raises a child as far as im concerned in this couple barack is the person who has the skill the inclination the desire the ability to be in politics i have no desire
4848588 so thats a good thing in my view since someone has to be focusing on the kids and thats me but it could easily be him theres no reason why the nurturing has to come from mom it just has to be there
4848589 it touches me when our girls touch him whether its with a story or a word you can see it in his face thats the leader i want somebody who is so moved by his own children that hell go out there and fight for everyone elses
4848590 we dont know her we dont know him were not sure where hes coming from or what shes really trying to do to our family values
4848591 if we dont define ourself for ourself well be crushed into others expectations of us and eaten alive
4848592 the phasing out of hd dvd format in favour of blu ray discs has boosted sales of the sony ps3 due to its blu ray technology nintendo has gained a niche market because of its interactive consoles and products such as wii fit allowing users to exercise while playing
4848593 the video gaming industry is making a major effort to broaden the appeal of games and consoles to other segments other than the core players of 8 21 year old males we are holding a gaming competition in sharjah to elevate awareness and reach out to other potential users as well
4848594 with the stellar sales of gaming consoles like the playstation 3 xbox 360 and nintendo wii added to the equation gaming technology will clearly emerge as an entertainment industry of equivalent value to film and television and one which continues to show significant growth

4848632 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
4848633 if a supplier wants to push us because of their fear that were going bankrupt then theyre violating the contract thats in place and i will take the necessary actions
4848634 i have had suppliers come to me with a gun to my head and i say i am not going to let you shut down production but if you are serious then you have to live with the legal consequences
4848635 and the legal consequences are not the end of it because if somebody does that i can tell you they will not be a supplier of choice

4848643 ya know jhonny i liked you so much better when you were just a ballplayer if you wanna be an interior decorator now thats none of my business but some of us still need this team now you listen to me this is my last shot at a winner and for some of the younger guys it could be their only shot i dont know what happened to you but if you ever ever tank another play like you did today im gonna cut your off and stuff em down your throat

4848655 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4848656 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world
4848657 i dont think a lot of teams have found a winning formula on a consistent basis
4848658 one of the things thats happened is a lot of players are leaving the league to go overseas and play
4848659 that and weve also had expansion teams have had to go out and replenish with foreign players and theres often a process to get acclimated a transition
4848660 the league was designed out of a lab as opposed to experiences in soccer
4848661 in the beginning it allowed motivation to bring in investors they could come in at an affordable price and compete right away
4848662 in the end we made the playoffs at the eighth spot and got nothing
4848663 theres a fine line between those eighth and ninth spots
4848664 center of mass is almost the average part of the mass

4848666 you can manipulate your center of mass if you raise your arms up you can raise your center of mass
4848667 what he was able to do with that high jump technique was to allow athletes to keep their body above their center of mass
4848668 the center of mass of an object doesnt have to be where there is mass
4848669 it was just simply intuition it was not based on science or analysis or thought or design it was all by instinct it happened one day at a competition my mind was driving my body to work out the best way to get over the bar
4848670 a variety of artificial turf products were evaluated for risk exposure to lead and the bottom line is parents should not be concerned about harmful levels of lead in artificial turf
4848671 they could not be trusted to protect children from lead in baby bibs or lunch boxes and now we see that they cant be trusted to protect children from lead in turf
4848672 i feel like i did at trials in the first couple of rounds
4848673 my coach said you look really good how did it feel i said coach i feel great i dont want to give everything yet
4848674 i dont think i executed my start the way ive been doing in warm ups and the way my coach wanted me to
4848675 but i dont feel like i overexerted myself and im really excited
4848676 make sure youre in the top two so you can stay in the middle of the track unfortunately ive run myself to the outside of the track before and its not pretty to be out there running for your life by yourself and know the race is going on outside of you
4848677 anybody else it would be like you dont talk to them
4848678 munas just really easy breezy cool and i just get into a nervous nellie mode so its good that we dont become those fierce angry type competitors we can talk
4848679 i feel like i did at trials in the first couple of rounds
4848680 my coach said you look really good how did it feel i said coach i feel great i dont want to give everything yet
4848681 i dont think i executed my start the way ive been doing in warm ups and the way my coach wanted me to
4848682 but i dont feel like i overexerted myself and im really excited
4848683 make sure youre in the top two so you can stay in the middle of the track unfortunately ive run myself to the outside of the track before and its not pretty to be out there running for your life by yourself and know the race is going on outside of you
4848684 anybody else it would be like you dont talk to them
4848685 munas just really easy breezy cool and i just get into a nervous nellie mode so its good that we dont become those fierce angry type competitors we can talk
4848686 we took the bus over to the track today we walked in together we chit chatted its kind of a comfortable feeling to know that even though were competitors you still get along well as soon as you cross the finish line its behind you
4848687 shawn and i have been thinking about this the whole time weve been here
4848688 team has always been most important but after getting the silver knowing the all around was next we are really excited about it
4848689 just to be here looking at the signs saying beijing 2008 it makes me proud knowing that ive worked so hard i feel stronger than ever and this is the competition ive been working for my entire life and i feel that im in a good spot
4848690 the third one you start feeling it its not a good feeling
4848691 youre seeing it so you know its happening they hit a lot of home runs and were making it easy on them because were not locating pitches
4848692 this series definitely falls on our offense for not producing much of anything
4848693 but 63 out of 100 pitches for strikes thats over 60 percent strikes i just have to be able to finish hitters
4848694 in a one run situation when we needed to be what he had been recently
4848695 its always good to get them back in the pool and knock off some of the rust
4848696 it would be nice to get another week of practice but then again you start getting a little antsy to play after another week
4848697 we condition them pretty hard if they are out of shape they are going to struggle the routine gets old and they get ready for that first meet
4848698 i dont think that they necessarily planned to play together at the beginning but its something they talked about some
4848699 they established a legacy at chrisman that they are going to build on this year and theyll be able to continue on together at college
4848700 iowa came through and made the offer theyve been my no 1 school for a while now
4848701 i didnt have to do much thinking i just took it right away
4848702 i had been in contact with the iowa coach for a couple years
4848703 he saw a lot of improvement in my game at that tournament last week and so he made me the offer he saw what he needed to see
4848704 it felt like i had been run over by a couple of trucks
4848705 but you do i go like wow i went through a lot
4848706 i wont lie it was a lot to deal with
4848707 it was more than frightening at some points for my mom and my family im trying to stay strong for them
4848708 i like to give my all for mizzou they gave me a chance to play here and i want to give them all ive got
4848709 the whole summer we were questioning and talking about it
4848710 if one of the other players is able to step up and im not ready to go i can deal with that but if i can play at a high level even if im like at 80 percent i can go
4848711 in the beginning it was a fear of not being able to play
4848712 they said you can do this continue taking blood thinners and never be able to play football or you can have surgery and have a chance to play football again
4848713 moving to a new classification were going to have to step up another notch
4848714 obviously every season you have to find out who your leaders are
4848715 and i needed to get this over with ill get ready to play tuesday in cleveland
4848716 i guess if need be in an emergency ill catch
4848717 i hope it doesnt happen but if need be ill go back there and do what i can do
4848718 they threw at me and i charged the mound things happen in baseball the thing is the white sox are the team i came up with i have a lot of friends over there i dont have anything against them
4848719 i cant play they threw at me and i reacted i wasnt the first one to do that and i wont be the last one
4848720 as far as live catching action its been going on five years for him he looked good receiving and i emphasized it would be in an emergency situation only
4848721 but when i caught the bullpen workout the receiving stuff was fine i didnt have any problem as far as catching pitches
4848722 i didnt do any blocking or throwing drills but as far as the receiving part that went fine
4848723 theres definitely a lack of focus in what david is swinging at
4848724 and i think most of that goes back to how hes feeling
4848725 how easy i was throwing and throwing that far this evening you could see something special
4848726 the only thing is coming back in the evening but i do this a lot at home ill train in the morning and then come back and throw at night and always in the evening my throws are better thats what im excited about
4848727 you might be a little fatigued and you have to make sure you stay solid with your form and if you do that then just let the emotions of the olympics take over
4848728 if people are interested in the tournament because something happened i guess its a positive
4848729 theres no justification for using that much water i need to fix this
4848730 we got a lot accomplished with a lot of the young guys that are going to play for us
4848731 that was the whole key coming up here we wanted to find out about a lot of young guys and weve learned a lot about their strengths and their weaknesses
4848732 we knew we had some athletes the physical part of it we didnt know about until we got here we established that we established that were going to be a physical football team thats something we have to be
4848733 thats the unknown because theyre so young you still arent sure how all the young guys will react thats going to be the key thing for us
4848734 flowers is the guy we thought hed be at corner
4848735 the game is not too big for carr charles is going to be fine morgan too and the tight end and will franklin we like johnston hes ok
4848736 theyre going to get on the job training theyre not going to be sitting on the sideline with me theyre going to play all of them
4848737 weve got to get him practicing again whenever that is and get him up to par
4848738 were disappointed about that but when he was practicing you could already see hes going to be a very good player for us
4848739 but its pretty gratifying to get to go to a usga event
4848740 im just happy as can be to get to go back to a usga event
4848741 anytime you can actually qualify for a usga event its kind of something special
4848742 theres just something about them the qualifiers are always tough so you always feel like you really accomplished something if you can get there
4848743 they just havent shown to me what they were showing earlier in the season
4848744 it hasnt been that long since hes won but for some reason i havent seen the same type of performance out of them here recently i would have thought the brickyard and at pocono that they would have really shined there and they didnt i think theyre showing some weakness right now so right now the bonus points are huge for them
4848745 certainly if somebody tells you that you cant do it or youre not any good you know or whatever the situation might be that kind of gives you extra motivation to prove somebody wrong that certainly can be motivation
4848746 and you can use those comments as motivation you can use the critics you can use articles you can use all of that to help motivate your team
4848747 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4848748 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back
4848749 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
4848750 it was a lack of respect on the part of the american coach to say that
4848751 the cuban team respects the game and respects our opponents and is incapable of doing that
4848752 wait till you see my pins ive been running around like crazy with a million pins
4848753 coach just wanted me to go out and blast the beginning out of the block in the first half and it worked it was a little hard being in the eighth lane but it doesnt really matter where you are
4848754 i just wanted to get my body used to it
4848755 i dont want it to go into shock later i want to do it now so my body will be ready to do it next time if i was to go out too easy its harder to finish
4848756 im not as nervous and star struck as last time
4848757 we got away from it all and as a coaching staff went out on a golf outing
4848758 its on the person to make sure he doesnt let himself go too much
4848759 its hard to let all the work go but you have to be disciplined to stay in shape
4848760 its good for the kids to get away from the coaches for the week
4848761 everyone needs to be kids athletics are so year round that they get overloaded theres not a lot of time to be kids anymore hopefully the players had a chance to get away and go to the swimming pool or the lake but still not lose what they gained over the summer
4848762 we closed camp down last thursday and told people to take off the next 11 days i think the break could be real good
4848763 this has not been your typical sponsorship this is like family
4848764 im bummed out hes been with us since he was a rookie its just a bummer but ill still be a fan
4848765 its as hard coming to these stores as it is going to the gibbs race shop
4848766 they know were not going to be coming back were excited about next year but there is that sadness on the other side of it that kind of keeps it off balance its part of the cycle i guess
4848767 priceless for our kids and our coaches to be able to experience that
4848768 if someone wouldve told me you shouldnt have high school kids on tv i would turn around and say look at this broadcast espn did a great job representing our community
4848769 theres no way around that this is going to be a distraction
4848770 well have many kids starting their first varsity game ever against rockhurst on espn how about that
4848771 its not just another tournament though you are also putting yourself up against some of the best in the nation along with the best in the city
4848772 there are a lot of people out here who expect you to play well its nice to be able to sleep in your own bed though
4848773 but these tournaments are huge if you want to be seen by coaches here you are going against the best players possible
4848774 i didnt even know i got the world record until i finished my victory lap my aim was to come here and be olympic champion
4848775 i had a pretty good start and i felt i was with usain
4848776 but i saw him pulling away hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone would have beaten him
4848777 i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics it just was one of those things that happened
4848778 when you race in the olympics and the trials you peak your body two times
4848779 i was prepared to peak my body twice but the injury set me back three or four weeks i think my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i think i just ran out of time
4848780 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4848781 ive been telling tyson all season when i saw him im really looking forward to competing with him
4848782 if you want to be the best youve got to beat the best
4848783 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4848784 i didnt even know i got the world record until i finished my victory lap my aim was to come here and be olympic champion
4848785 i had a pretty good start and i felt i was with usain
4848786 but i saw him pulling away hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone would have beaten him
4848787 i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics it just was one of those things that happened

4848789 i was prepared to peak my body twice but the injury set me back three or four weeks i think my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i think i just ran out of time
4848790 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4848791 ive been telling tyson all season when i saw him im really looking forward to competing with him
4848792 if you want to be the best youve got to beat the best
4848793 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4848794 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4848795 sailing is a very happy sport its not like running
4848796 sailors like to have their cake and eat it too i helped them clean up their diets and lower body fat
4848797 the right foods can make the difference between medalists and hopefuls the last thing you want is to be upchucking or cramping out on the water
4848798 my biggest weakness as an athlete is i love to eat
4848799 ill have the brownie sundae when the olympics are over
4848800 i feel sorry for liu yan my heart is full of regrets
4848801 im deeply sorry liu yan is a heroine she sacrificed a lot for the olympics for me for the opening ceremony

4848803 when i came to kansas city there were three things i wanted to accomplish
4848804 one was to play on a team on a regular basis two was to play on a winning team and three was to win a championship im proud to have accomplished all those goals
4848805 the first thing you have to do to achieve such a record is stay relatively healthy
4848806 and ive been around coaches who believed in me and saw me as part of the solution
4848807 i feel like ive come as close as i could to the fullest potential in me
4848808 im glad i could accomplish so much im going to miss the competitiveness but im not going to miss the aches and pains
4848809 you reach a point where you know you can no longer do some things as good as you used to i never played the game because i love the game i played because i wanted to be good at it
4848810 i always take the same approach and try to improve on a daily basis
4848811 but that lit a fire under me to try even harder in training to get back out there
4848812 i spent a year in the a league prior to coming here
4848813 i told myself id give it a year here and if it didnt work out id go into coaching
4848814 i started taking coaching courses when i came here i took my b courses and then got my a license
4848815 i look forward to the day when i can join the coaching ranks
4848816 kansas city has given so much to me theres a special place in my heart here
4848817 not next week next month or next year but someday i would love to be the coach in kansas city

4848823 i hate pinheads i especially hate pinheads with bombs and blowing up young parents doesnt make pinhead ideology any more worthy or persuasive
4848824 first of all i cant be anorexic i like food too much
4848825 im not on diet pills and i have to tell you honestly with nutrisystem you eat all the time
4848826 a crispy herb scented crust complements the savory tomato sauce and cheese in a great new pizza creation thats glycemic friendly and a great tasting dinner
4848827 i was amazed at how much sauce and cheese came with it
4848828 italy and spain led the world in the adoption of forks initially the french considered forks foppish but later they co opted the instrument and became quite vociferous about the varying flavors that different metals could lend to fish fruit and salads thomas doryat an englishman adopted the fork in 1611 at least for carving seeing all mens fingers are not alike cleane cleanliness and consideration of others being recurring themes in the drama of table manners

4848830 the blueberry muffins were the very first thing i tried after receiving my food
4848831 the cinnamon swirl bar was the first bar i had and i fell in love
4848832 my favorite thing is the new nutrisystem chocolate crunch bar
4848833 i thought the wedged potatoes with sliced beef steak was delicious and so did my husband
4848834 i simply cant get enough of the cheesy homestyle potatoes with broccoli

4848837 continue to follow progressive democratic politics in the spirit of howard deans effort to the beltway snark poses the question
4848838 with this premature announcement proclamation radar magazine has showed positively their cards on the table
4848839 youll find a snapshot of michelle obama staring you down as she strikes a serious pose on the cover of the glossy
4848840 features one of the least flattering pictures of michelle obama to date
4848841 but my mom and dad told me when i was really little id throw the ribbon but then id run away and do a cartwheel
4848842 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4848843 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something my dad has always taught me dont go in thinking am i going to make it or am i going to fall just go in confident knowing youre going to make it just think of how youre going to stick the dismount or make every little correction
4848844 i knew if i went out and hit my routines the way i was hoping to and the way id been training that i had a good chance
4848845 i think that makes it a little sweeter just knowing ive been through a few pretty big injuries it made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4848846 anytime this organization has the opportunity to secure an excellent talent and a guy we feel is going to be a major part of putting this organization on the right track we cant miss out on those types of opportunities
4848847 its been building up all summer so now that its finally happened im really excited
4848848 with any other team i kind of wouldve doubted it but i felt so good about the royals i knew itd be a perfect fit
4848849 deric and the staff said all along this guys the most impactful player in the draft with certainly the highest upside if were going to win championships in kansas city we have to take guys we think are going to be all stars and not just major leaguers
4848850 weve got to take players who we think are going to be big time players and thats what excites me about eric
4848851 but to get those types of people in this organization it makes every other player in this organization better
4848852 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4848853 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4848854 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4848855 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4848856 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4848857 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4848858 me and gettis weve been talking since before camp started
4848859 but im not satisfied im on top but theyre still coming to get me
4848860 i think this year is going to be the year
4848861 everybody sees maclin do that theyre thinking theres no way he isnt going to get it
4848862 its going to be a nice play i like that the running backs we all like that
4848863 i think im pretty versatile whatever they want me to do im going to do if they want to swing me out wide and catch the ball put me in the backfield and run the ball and block
4848864 you come out there and you know you dont have any weak links you cant name one weak link we go out there and we trust each other
4848865 we have a saying where i train last throw best throw
4848866 it wasnt the best throw of the day but it was my best throw so ill take it
4848867 had i gotten a better throw early i think i could have put it away
4848868 man i hope hes not all grown up by the time i get back
4848869 ive been here so long that i forgot what he looks like ive got a picture of him but im sure hes going to be a lot different by the time i get home
4848870 i was having some technical errors and pulling it down the left side
4848871 the more important thing is that christian cantwell won a silver medal i think he should be given a lot of praise for that because he certainly had a lot of stress and pressure on him over the last few years and hes an amazing athlete
4848872 dont hold anything back just spin as fast as you can break your fingers off and see where it lands and i almost broke my fingers off but luckily i got an inch longer than the second place guy so i walk away with a little bit of redemption from 2004
4848873 ill take silver for now four more years and i guess ill have to come back to the olympics and get the different colored one
4848874 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract
4848875 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint ive seen the success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done at other venues i just look forward to the opportunity hes a hard nose racer become a good friend as an opposing competitor so it says a lot about that i just look forward to the experience
4848876 our t shirt promotions have been a popular promotion for us going back multiple years
4848877 it happens that this is a great time to recognize joakim soria for his contributions particularly making the all star team
4848878 we certainly recognize that the nickname mexicutioner is out there
4848879 but from what i understand whb cant and hasnt taken ownership of that nickname
4848880 these will be more of a fashion t shirt than a baseball jersey
4848881 we want you to decide the nickname for royals pitcher joakim soria
4848882 the thing i liked when he was up here before was his plane
4848883 his plane was almost always downhill more often than not he had tilt to the slider
4848884 with ronnie coming back from plantar fasciitis and trying to take care of the other bullpen arms it was a good time for us to get another multiuse arm from omaha
4848885 when i came up i had a lot to prove
4848886 i wasnt one of those players who was going to be given anything i was going to have to work hard i was going to do that anyway i wanted to prove i deserved to be here and could help a team win
4848887 is to show that i can compete at this level and help a team win usually when you go about your business that way everything else falls into place ive been fortunate its falling into a good place for me right now
4848888 and im hoping to play today the pain isnt as bad before it was just shooting down my legs my legs felt dead
4848889 at night i was waking up every two hours its better thats not happening anymore
4848890 its not the same swing hes not utilizing his lower half like he normally does
4848891 i didnt feel the ball in my hand that well it just wasnt a good day
4848892 something said its yours baby take it but i didnt do it
4848893 none of the americans did right now i dont feel much im hoping it sets in that i did something
4848894 early this morning the 18th of july burglars broke up a door in abergs museum rushed in and quickly grabbed exactly what they wanted and what they must have known where there a couple of warhol pictures and three lichtensteins we send along pictures of the stolen artwork they also stole an old film poster which were located next to a warhol also with the title the new spirit we think they made a mistake in the rush police have no trace of the burglars and the artwork could have already left the country we are of course very sorry about this mess
4848895 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
4848896 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision
4848897 beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them for then you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven
4848898 im a competitor so you want to compete against the best and those guys are some pretty talented receivers its going to be a lot of fun out there i admit that its hard to believe im playing against guys i grew up idolizing im out there checking them
4848899 i used to watch these guys on tv and i always wondered what it would be like to line up against that person pretty soon im going to know
4848900 pretty soon theyll be playing against randy moss and some other good receivers every week it will be somebody good so lets see how they react
4848901 the thing i like about them is these guys hit all of our guys in the secondary hit people but our corners tackle well thats important for us weve got to have corners that can tackle
4848902 theyve put a lot on his plate because he plays corner and he plays nickel but hes picked it up
4848903 im trying not to look too far ahead but thats hard because its randy moss
4848904 ive got to focus on the cardinals because those receivers are pretty good players too
4848905 were executing a lot of things we did last year maybe even better i like the way were running the football i like the way were throwing the ball our offense is on track
4848906 our guys on defense know when they take him on they better wrap him up and keep their feet moving or hell break the tackle he has bursting speed he also has good lateral change of direction speed he has a lot of tools
4848907 the tackles are really developing jeremiah hatch is one of the hardest working guys and hardest playing guys we have on the team what he lacks in some experience hell make up for with grit and toughness and hard work spikes he is one of the most athletic linemen weve ever had here
4848908 youre looking for quality not quantity we want high quality players back there weve got three guys we like four i dont have a problem with what we have to tell you the truth theres no strength in numbers
4848909 very very businesslike its the most serious freshman class weve had here these guys came here to play
4848910 it gave us an opportunity to give our mission legs
4848911 our mission is to empower women through sports and fitness and i loved that we were able to really put that in action
4848912 to see all those different women and the different ages shapes and sizes cross finish line with excitement and accomplishment was wonderful
4848913 it has huge potential and room to grow we dont know what the max is at smithville but we are getting close to it
4848914 i think the kids came out today and really wanted to send a statement
4848915 he was throwing but he wasnt hitting me as much as i was hitting him its the judges the judges saw otherwise
4848916 i called back to the people in the tape room and everybody said it was pure garbage
4848917 i thought i was seeing things he was landing three or four shots to one and wasnt getting points
4848918 we got a little luck to go along with their luck
4848919 ive played with mitch for a couple of years now
4848920 it was a two seamer he just spiked it as soon as he released it i could tell it was going into the dirt

4848936 i am almost certain that it was the president of the united states the imperialist george bush who ordered the movement of the georgian troops towards south ossetia killing innocent people and with good reason russia acted
4848937 because this country rose up and now is a new world potential thanks to the work of ex president vladmir putin
4848938 whoever wins the presidency in the u s learns and reconsiders the legitimate sovereignty of countries and understands that in latin america there is a revolution a peaceful revolution because our people have discovered a fundamental weapon which is the vote
4848939 venezuela has been following with concern the development of the conflict and in particular the increase in unacceptable acts of violence perpetrated by the georgian troops against the south ossetian population in this sense venezuela reiterates its rejection of all actions that violate human rights especially the right to life
4848940 the military offensive by georgia in south ossetia without any valid reason spread the calls to war in the caucasus region this conflict was planned prepared and ordered by the government of the united states which far from promoting the reestablishment of peace in the area went to work on encouraging the aggression of the georgian government the international community was once more witness to the reoccurring policy of destabilization and incitement to violence that north american imperialism is used to putting in practice in distinct regions of the world
4848941 likewise the government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela observed that the russian federation protected by international agreements that legitimize the presence of its peace forces in south ossetia acted to preserve the life of the south ossetian population
4848942 finally the government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela lover of peace and fervent defender of human rights advocates that the given steps lead to lasting peace in south ossetia and in the whole region of the caucasus and invites the european countries to not permit that external actors put the stability of the european continent and the peace of the world at risk

4848952 you know i never hear your voice before until during the strings interview
4848953 it is to be regretted that a portion of our community should be practically in slavery but to propose to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish
4848954 sometimes i wonder why i bother children and wives wreck everything the pony is just an expense and a hassle and now weve got this new puppy do the children look after it and feed it no theyre stuck on the computer brave new world has conquered i have lost goodbye

4848958 ensure that an embattled democracy seeking to stand with us remains sovereign secure and undivided
4848959 alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4848960 part of an inspiring and hopeful new chapter in europes history
4848961 since independence a decade ago aided and abetted by the same founts of washington wisdom the seven unfortunates armenia azerbaijan georgia kyrgyz republic moldova tajikistan and uzbekistan have regressed to a malignant combination of unbridled autocracy and perpetual illiquidity poverty soared to african proportions the regions economies shriveled and public and external debts mounted dizzyingly
4848962 putting the countries themselves in the drivers seat of reforms
4848963 the political repression the personality cults the blatant looting of the state by pernicious networks of cronies the rampant nepotism the elimination of the free media and the proliferation of every conceivable abuse of human and civil rights up to and including the assassination of opponents and dissidents to raise these delicate issues would have been impolitic when the imfs largest shareholder the united states has embraced these despots as newfound allies
4848964 the world bank recognized georgia as the worlds fastest reforming economy in its 2008 doing business report ranking it as the worlds 18th easiest place to do business
4848965 the world bank european bank for reconstruction and development eu osce and the un are all active in georgia their goals are complementary and include assisting in conflict resolution in abkhazia and south ossetia
4848966 russia is attacking georgia to achieve regime change and crush georgias pro western democracy georgian president mikheil saakashvili said monday
4848967 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
4848968 while we can never say that florida is entirely free of the disease without testing every deer this sample size gives us confidence that if cwd is present in florida it is at low levels
4848969 however even low numbers of cwd positive deer would be cause for concern so we plan to continue testing for the foreseeable future
4848970 early detection is the key to limiting the spread of the disease if such an outbreak should occur in florida
4848971 were asking hunters to report any sightings of sickly or scrawny looking deer or deer dead of unknown causes
4848972 if you see such a deer call toll free 1 866 cwd watch 293 9282 please do not handle the deer wildlife biologists will respond and if necessary collect deer tissue for testing its important to contact us as soon as possible because such testing must take place within 48 hours of a deers death to yield reliable results
4848973 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4848974 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4848975 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4848976 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4848977 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4848978 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4848979 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4848980 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4848981 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4848982 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4848983 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4848984 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4848985 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4848986 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4848987 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4848988 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4848989 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4848990 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4848991 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4848992 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4848993 os resultados confirmam uma vez mais a legitimidade de duas agendas que se op em o que obriga busca de um ponto comum antes que os surtos de viol ncia se estendam perigosamente
4848994 first day of practice we didnt expect him to make it through the first five minutes
4848995 were sure hes going to be cramped up under the tent with all the rest of them that are too heavy you figure anyone that big has their problems high blood pressure dehydration hurt all the time cant move whatever well in two years here he never missed one period of practice never cramped or dehydrated once
4848996 i dont know if we have two kids that can spot 350 on each side anyway but he looked ready for more
4848997 i fear we all have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve
4848998 i remember the 70s waiting in line for gas what have we done since then shame on us
4848999 its unconscionable for the state bureaucracy to be blocking approvals when families and businesses are suffering daily from outrageous energy costs
4849000 it seems as though theres too much wind in the newark offices of the bpu and not enough determination to get offshore windmills tested promptly
4849001 if you dont take the first step youre not going to get there
4849002 this is the first time we are considering offshore wind
4849003 it is one of the first times in the united states its been considered its something you want to do right
4849004 the way she ran reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on
4849005 a lot of song youll hate but you can dig through to find others you wont
4849006 a lot of crap you wont like but maybe some you will
4849007 hmm well most of the music isnt actually worth listening to so could you give me your best meh face
4849008 dont worry about it with so much attention to detail going on here wrong or right doesnt matter
4849009 if you go to the rhapsody site clicking on their software download button doesnt even ask what platform you have or inform you that its windows only it simply shoves a
4849010 so the deal is that you buy a crap phone download a crap music service with loads of crap you dont want but some you might crap that is and headphones that look like they are from the 1970s
4849011 boo apple do drm and the other guys dont bad apple bad
4849012 have no fear im super mouse did somebody say my name
4849013 as if he were no longer an enemy combatant and house him accordingly while it uses its best efforts to place him in a foreign country
4849014 the new district ypenburg is conceived as an urban field between the cities of delft and the hague
4849015 the framework creates urban conditions that will only later be cashed by the architecture but this framework is more than just a grid of lines and public space it possesses its own architectural dimension as well a tangible form
4849016 now apparently recognizes that her conduct was criminal in nature
4849017 my atomic is better than your scubapro is better than poseidon is better than atmos etc
4849018 courts generally dont bother in expending their resources if they arent inclined to rule in a different way
4849019 what happened to him would beggar the imagination of franz kafka
4849020 arar was in effect abducted this lawsuit is thus about the propriety and constitutionality of the manner in which united states law enforcement sought to obtain from arar information about terrorism or terrorists which they thought wrongly as it turned out that he possessed
4849021 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4849022 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
4849023 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
4849024 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4849025 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4849026 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4849027 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4849028 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
4849029 nunca renunciaremos a la presencia de nuestras tropas de paz en osetia del sur y abjasia si renunci ramos ahora a cumplir nuestras funciones quien garantizar a all la seguridad
4849030 acuerdo de 1992 suscrito tras el fin de la guerra entre georgia y osetia que determina las tareas de las tropas de paz rusas en las zonas de conflicto
4849031 el tema principal ahora es si rusia da muestras de contenci n
4849032 el mundo ha visto con inquietud c mo rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba a un gobierno elegido democr ticamente por su pueblo
4849033 completamente inaceptable para las naciones libres del mundo las acciones emprendidas por rusia en georgia
4849034 para comenzar a reparar el da o que ha causado a sus relaciones con estados unidos europa y otros pa ses y para empezar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo
4849035 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
4849036 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
4849037 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
4849038 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodling a fact that the evidence will bear out in court

4849043 de bedreigingen in de column aan het adres van groenlinks politica femke halsema zijn van dien aard dat de pvda amsterdam verdere samenwerking niet wenselijk acht

4849056 hace tres meses la gente no hablaba de espa a y ahora son el mejor equipo del mundo es un milagro
4849057 espa a es un buen equipo juegan bien pero nosotros tenemos un estilo diferente y creo que podemos ganarles por qu no tengo mucha confianza
4849058 s lo torres es un gran delantero en este momento en el mundo
4849059 las otras selecciones en italia est n as as en alemania igual en portugal no en francia no vimos nada es un problema porque los equipos defienden muy bien es un problema en todas partes
4849060 tengo confianza en estos jugadores porque he visto los pasos que hemos dado en los amistosos he visto la eurocopa y a los otros equipos y creo que nosotros somos muy buenos
4849061 s lo que estos jugadores pueden hacer cuando juegan con sus clubes no hay una mentalidad perdedora sino ganadora debemos trasferir la misma mentalidad al equipo nacional para jugar con la misma confianza

4849374 weve learned a lot about pain in the last five years weve had jordan weve learned some hurts are really necessary for kids pain is necessary for kids to find out the difference between whats good and whats harmful

4849449 im proud that my team was involved in that kind of match
4849450 obviously conceding three goals in the manner we conceded them i thought they were really sloppy goals really sloppy i was looking for one or two of my defenders to put their neck on the line
4849451 but the time we conceded them you cant win a football match like that you maybe get away with it in the lower divisions youll not get away with it in the spl
4849452 if im totally honest we couldve got something out the match but i think that would have been unjust
4849453 in that first half hibs couldve scored more goals but all credit to my players i felt once we sorted one or two things we took the game to them and tried to get back in it
4849454 but once again gave our self a mountain to climb losing a goal a minute or so into the second half so real disappointment but there are positives there
4849455 one of the positives is if you look at the performance of jackie mcnamara

4849580 i had some food poisoning yesterday was sick in the night and didnt sleep much
4849581 i feel all right now but ive not eaten anything and didnt feel comfortable with my swing
4849582 we settled better we got goals at the right time and alan brogan getting injured had a big impact
4849583 dublin will be the first team to admit that they didnt do themselves justice today

4849585 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4849586 im proud that my team was involved in that kind of match
4849587 obviously conceding three goals in the manner we conceded them i thought they were really sloppy goals really sloppy i was looking for one or two of my defenders to put their neck on the line
4849588 but the time we conceded them you cant win a football match like that you maybe get away with it in the lower divisions youll not get away with it in the spl
4849589 if im totally honest we couldve got something out the match but i think that would have been unjust
4849590 in that first half hibs couldve scored more goals but all credit to my players i felt once we sorted one or two things we took the game to them and tried to get back in it
4849591 but once again gave our self a mountain to climb losing a goal a minute or so into the second half so real disappointment but there are positives there
4849592 one of the positives is if you look at the performance of jackie mcnamara
4849593 i felt he was falkirks best player a guy that maybe after aberdeen was looking about and saying maybe thats me coming to falkirk finding a new lease of life and goes out there and a guy thats played for celtic in the champions league who goes out there and just strolls about
4849594 he goes out there and strolls about and gives it absolutely everything hes got why because its the values of him thats the kind of guys he is
4849595 we were looking fine in the first 25 minutes but we dropped our heads after the first goal
4849596 the other two goals were disappointing they came from set pieces we were naive in both situations
4849597 i think the scoreline is a bit harsh as one or two things did not go our way
4849598 we improved when they came on and i think we will be better when we gain experience in the premier league
4849599 thomas sorensen played well in goal and i am confident dave kitson will get goals for us
4849600 he is a good player and there is going to be an obvious link with nicolas anelka
4849601 im not sure if i can go yet i may have other plans

4849608 vamos a sacar un equipo competitivo el futbol es siempre ganar para que tu afici n est contenta intentaremos que sea ma ana y luego habr que pensar en la uefa y despu s en la liga es el d a a d a es nuestra vida y hay que acostumbrarse ahora lo m s cercano es el teresa herrera e intentaremos llegar a la final
4849609 los mexicanos son un buen equipo pelotero que juega bien al futbol que tiene la baja de torrado por estar con la selecci n y que fue subcampe n el a o pasado lo tiene todo para que sea un buen partido
4849610 de los torneos veraniegos el teresa herrera es el que m s ha mantenido el nivel hay que seguir haci ndolo vienen dos grandes equipos y un sporting que por historia lleva muchos a os en segunda pero que es muy querido en toda espa a y que viene despu s de haber ascendido a primera el cartel es muy bonito e interesante
4849611 el tener cuatro partidos oficiales provoc que tuvi ramos que hacer el equipo r pido y que jug ramos ante rivales fuertes pr cticamente de primera divisi n y que en la preparaci n f sica nos llevaban bastante ventaja la exigencia ha sido superior y va a hacer que lleguemos a la liga mucho m s rodados de lo normal
4849612 tenemos la duda de si el equipo croata va a ser capaz de defender tan bien como en riazor teniendo la necesidad de atacar eso supone que nosotros tenemos que defender bien y atacarles no considero la uefa perdida ni mucho menos van a tener muchas dificultades pero tengo mucha confianza de seguir adelante
4849613 pero con todo y eso vamos a ir a buscar el triunfo
4849614 que es un equipo que casi no le anotan bien ordenado defensivamente y con mucha din mica y disputa en la recuperaci n de la pelota y eso nos dice que ser un partido complicado en el medio campo entonces trataremos que nuestro equipo sea intenso cuando se tenga la pelota y se vaya al frente y evitar el acomodo inmediato del rival
4849615 el equipo est bien an micamente despu s de retomar la victoria frente a lobos buap ten a rato que no se ganaba de una manera tan desahogada 3 0 y parece que eso nos da tranquilidad aunque estamos conscientes de que debemos seguir trabajando por la realidad es lo que viene
4849616 hasta el momento lo tenemos considerado para jugar pero todav a no s por qui n entrar
4849617 va a ser una eliminatoria f cil porque van tres boletos y medio al mundial y creo que es una papita puede tener ciertas piedras en el camino y alg n disgusto pero al final de cuentas vamos a ir al mundial porque no puede ser que m xico no pueda con tres boletos y medio
4849618 yo prefiero que no est n no tengo nada con ellos pero pienso que perdemos identidad si queremos copiar debemos copiar a los argentinos y a los brasile os que conf an en sus capacidades y la historia dice que con los naturalizados no hemos hecho nada mejor
4849619 hice una cr tica en el diario en el que escribo y espero que lo tomen as que los entrenadores deben trabajar primero en eso no puedes ver t a los jugadores volte ndose ante un tiro tienen que aguantarla y eso es m nimo entonces yo de broma dije que qu pena con erickson que va a encontrar que ni los elementos defensivos aparecen en los equipos profesionales
4849620 es un equipo que tiene gente de experiencia como jorge bernal en el arco tienen a david oteo y a erick espinosa en la parte de la defensa central mucha experiencia david fue compa ero m o as que te puedes imaginar en tigres est lesionado pues es una baja sensible de repente para ellos en el medio campo tienen al til n ch vez a josu castillejos por derecha tienen a migue lay n por izquierda tienen a nico olivera y arriba tienen dos jugadores que es garc a que va bien por arriba que tiene mucha movilidad y despu s o est francisco bravo o est ariel gonz lez entonces son dos jugadores que son desequilibrantes m s sus dos laterales el derecho y el izquierdo que va mucho a la ofensiva le gusta irse mucho a la ofensiva ya que nico olivera siempre agarra hacia el centro y le deja el callej n para que l suba
4849621 entonces es un equipo que tiene muchas variantes en las jugadas de t ctica fija le gusta tener la pelota no se desespera es un equipo que tiene todo para buscar el ascenso
4849622 un partido creo que interesante importante para nosotros saber d nde estamos parados y jugamos ante un rival que tiene jugadores muy importantes que han jugado en primera divisi n que est muy bien dirigido y lo principal es que las aspiraciones que tiene veracruz es lograr el ascenso r pidamente por todo lo que representa la plaza la afici n la instituci n en si entonces nosotros venimos a buscar un buen resultado con nuestras armas con nuestra estrategia nuestra t ctica pero venimos a sacar un buen resultado porque cruz azul es un equipo de los llamados grandes y la mentalidad y la filosof a m a es salir a proponer el partido en cualquier cancha esa es la filosof a de cruz azul

4849758 there is very little skepticism toward climate science as i stated above the phenomenon of opposition to this science is in fact denialism
4849759 a few noisy skeptics most of whom are not even scientists
4849760 the fact is all of the scientific academies and organizations that matter are in consensus
4849761 the problem we are faced with is that the meteorological establishment and the global warming lobby research bodies which receive large funding are now apparently so corrupted by the largesse they receive that the scientists in them have sold their integrity
4849762 with the overwhelming science out there the deniers days were numbered
4849763 there was a movement behind this that just wasnt giving up
4849764 suspiciously like that of many others you ve seen in the past who are not genuinely curious and are not amenable to instruction and correction
4849765 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4849766 first their opinion doesnt matter nearly as much as the opinions of climate scientists expertise in one field doesnt grant expertise in another
4849767 i have claimed no expertise for myself on this question of anthropogenic global warming
4849768 war poverty environmental destruction these are all communal sins of which we are guilty but god has given us grace for those mistakes and has called us to a completely different way of living one that does not operate the same way the current world does with violence retribution selfishness greed etc its a different kingdom that operates in a completely different way and we are called in the great commission to make disciples of this way the way of jesus the way of god

4849777 i had some food poisoning yesterday was sick in the night and didnt sleep much
4849778 i feel all right now but ive not eaten anything and didnt feel comfortable with my swing
4849779 we settled better we got goals at the right time and alan brogan getting injured had a big impact
4849780 dublin will be the first team to admit that they didnt do themselves justice today
4849781 we were looking fine in the first 25 minutes but we dropped our heads after the first goal
4849782 the other two goals were disappointing they came from set pieces we were naive in both situations
4849783 i think the scoreline is a bit harsh as one or two things did not go our way
4849784 we improved when they came on and i think we will be better when we gain experience in the premier league
4849785 thomas sorensen played well in goal and i am confident dave kitson will get goals for us
4849786 he is a good player and there is going to be an obvious link with nicolas anelka
4849787 im proud that my team was involved in that kind of match
4849788 obviously conceding three goals in the manner we conceded them i thought they were really sloppy goals really sloppy i was looking for one or two of my defenders to put their neck on the line
4849789 but the time we conceded them you cant win a football match like that you maybe get away with it in the lower divisions youll not get away with it in the spl
4849790 if im totally honest we couldve got something out the match but i think that would have been unjust
4849791 in that first half hibs couldve scored more goals but all credit to my players i felt once we sorted one or two things we took the game to them and tried to get back in it
4849792 but once again gave our self a mountain to climb losing a goal a minute or so into the second half so real disappointment but there are positives there
4849793 one of the positives is if you look at the performance of jackie mcnamara
4849794 i felt he was falkirks best player a guy that maybe after aberdeen was looking about and saying maybe thats me coming to falkirk finding a new lease of life and goes out there and a guy thats played for celtic in the champions league who goes out there and just strolls about
4849795 he goes out there and strolls about and gives it absolutely everything hes got why because its the values of him thats the kind of guys he is

4849813 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4849832 c tait important de prendre des points domicile et de gagner apr s notre d faite bordeaux notre victoire est m rit e nous avons fait la diff rence en 35 minutes mais nous tions un peu entre deux chaises en ayant d j beaucoup donn physiquement nous aurions pu alourdir la note en 2e p riode mais il faut aussi que nous posions parfois davantage le jeu que nous soyons plus fort strat giquement
4849833 cest parfois bien de perdre cela fera rentrer dans la t te de mes gar ons quon ne peut pas gagner un match en le commen ant de mani re si catastrophique nous donnons le b ton pour nous faire battre en leur faisant trois cadeaux le point positif cest notre force de caract re nous avons continu jouer aller de lavant et avons marqu logiquement nous aurions pu faire douter caen en marquant un deuxi me but
4849834 je suis d u par la mani re et la performance de ce soir on a commenc notre match en seconde p riode c tait d j trop tard le mans na pas vol sa victoire ils ont tr s bien jou le contre en premi re p riode mais on est en grande partie responsable de ce qui nous est arriv pour une premi re domicile cest rat peut tre mis un peu trop de pression de bien faire on a manqu de percussion de vitesse on a manqu de tout il va falloir bien analyser les choses et puis parfois une bonne claque a peut aussi servir rebondir
4849835 marquer trois buts lext rieur ce nest pas rien jai vu une quipe solide qui est all e de lavant qui a pos des probl mes limage du deuxi me but apr s on a souffert parce que lille a pouss sur des longs ballons sur des coups de pied arr t s malgr leur retour on a trouv les ressources et marqu un joli troisi me but on savait quon allait subir leur jeu direct on a donc appuy notre discours sur la pr sence dans les duels sur le travail en avant pour les faire douter et cest ce qui sest produit
4849836 en premi re p riode on a fris plusieurs fois la correctionnelle on prend encore une fois un but sur une erreur un moment o on n tait pas attentif ensuite l quipe tait coup e en deux devant on ne savait pas tenir le ballon et les milieux jouaient devant la d fense en deuxi me p riode on a su relever la t te les rempla ants ont apport ce quil fallait et on a t plus agressif sur le porteur du ballon cest d j bien d tre revenu au score car quand on est men par une bonne equipe on ne peut tre d u
4849837 en deuxi me p riode on a connu vingt minutes difficiles et ils ont repris confiance cela fait aussi partie du jeu je ne sais pas si cest nous qui craquons ou cest eux qui nous mettent en difficult s dans lensemble cest un bon match de championnat avec beaucoup doccasions jai cependant un peu de regret lissue de la premi re p riode on peut mener plus largement on a compl tement ma tris on a eu plusieurs occasions mais on na marqu quune seule fois quatre points cest pas mal a ce stade on nen avait quun lan pass
4849838 on a transform un ballon moyen en but dans les toutes derni res secondes pour une victoire larrach e nous avons vu tout ce quil nous fallait encore travailler pour gagner en fluidit et retrouver un style mais je ne vais pas cracher sur cette victoire d croch e l nergie et au mental devant un adversaire aussi coriace que nancy ces trois points vont nous permettre de bosser dans la confiance
4849839 quand un match se d cante ainsi sur le fil il y a videmment un heureux et un malheureux mais je suis partag car si mon quipe a donn trop de cadeaux nice elle ma montr des choses int ressantes beaucoup plus que devant lille o je navais vu que quelques petites tincelles apr s la pause mais cest tr s dur de faire autant defforts sans aucune r compense
4849840 il y a eu une superbe entame qui aurait d nous mettre sur une voie royale puis nous avons connu un dernier quart dheure difficile les changements que jai effectu s nont pas t la hauteur de mes esp rances sochaux a eu le m rite dy avoir cru mais je pense quavant ces vingt derni res minutes nous aurions d nous mettre labri et g rer ce match il y a deux sentiments retenir en premier lieu tout ce qui a t tr s positif et en second lieu une partie plut t inqui tante pour certains joueurs il peut y avoir un probl me physique saint etienne peut pr tendre de belles choses cette saison mais la fin de la rencontre me laisse un go t amer et je suis inquiet de cela
4849841 saint etienne a profit de nos erreurs de placement en premi re p riode mais apr s la mi temps nous avons t plus entreprenants nous avons r duit la marque nous avons une nouvelle d fense avec le br silien carlao qui ne parle pas fran ais perquis qui remplace afolabi et faty qui vient darriver en deux journ es nous avons conc d deux d faites nous sommes d j en crise la saison derni re nous avions bien rectifi et je ne d sesp re pas de faire la m me chose cette ann e
4849842 en premi re mi temps nous avons fait preuve de f brilit nous avons eu beaucoup de mal a mettre en place en notre jeu en deuxi me mi temps nous avons apport du sang neuf plus de percussion en essayant de les pousser la faute sur la deuxi me mi temps notre victoire est m rit e il y a eu beaucoup de solidarit entre tous les joueurs et m me tout le groupe y compris ceux qui n taient pas sur la feuille de match je suis content pour gignac qui est un joueur avec beaucoup de qualit s et qui depuis la pr paration sentra ne tr s bien on avait vraiment envie de d buter notre saison domicile par une victoire et nous avons pris les risques pour y parvenir

4849857 she reminds me of where i came from reminds me to stay humble and reminds me to keep a level head
4849858 i honestly dont know what it is about my play that draws so much attention
4849859 im just playing a game the only way i know how i guess my speed makes it exciting and i guess i do have the ability to break it open at any time but i feel like a lot of guys have that
4849860 i tell everyone to come to a practice and watch him
4849861 his play speaks for itself there is no verbal explanation of how great he is you just have to watch him especially in practice
4849862 we knew he was healthy but we are happy to see him respond the way he has
4849863 hes responded like a champ running physically catching the ball without looking over his shoulder and popping up after every hit
4849864 jahvid has really started to step it up and is practicing at another level both mentally and physically
4849865 his attention to detail is second to none you look in his eyes and theres a different focus
4849866 his speed jumps out at you but his attention to detail is what is going to pay big dividends down the line listen we know the kid is talented but he has a tremendous work ethic that is going to make him special
4849867 i definitely feel a lot of pressure because there are years of big shoes to fill but im not going to doubt myself
4849868 i remember asking forsett how he felt before the tennessee game and he said i have confidence in my skills and how ive been coached so everything else should take care of itself
4849869 he said part of it is that it was killing him to sit there and review outings where he gave up eight hits
4849870 the other thing he said was that he really had to work on some of these nagging injuries
4849871 making it to 300 was a long way away and the way last year went odds were real slim there would have even been a chance
4849872 so would i have come back to play one more year somewhere else im relieved i didnt have to make that decision
4849873 it was like my arch gave and my shoe was still on
4849874 it just felt like my foot went way farther down than it should have
4849875 if its bothering you enough that you cant go play then dont go play
4849876 if you feel good enough to do your job then dont make an excuse for why it didnt work out
4849877 no question you start thinking am i ever going to feel good again
4849878 if i have to do this for another year how miserable is that going to be thats what creeps into your head

4849887 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4849888 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

4849896 our guys want to win these guys have had five coaches in five years most of whom ive known and theyve all been good coaches
4849897 its probably been more of a stepping stone than stanford would like but i think that will change now as long as i dont mess it up
4849898 and hes a great character guy i would be sitting across the hall and at 7 15 in the morning hed call his kids every day before they left for school i just remember that
4849899 he knows a lot of football and he doesnt have an ego about it
4849900 hes been through everything scenario in the scheme so we can get right to the point
4849901 when he tells you a guy needs to be at a certain depth or width on the field you just do it because he knows
4849902 its like a genetic defect you just love it so much
4849903 you love the relationships the opportunity to teach and motivate and coach and its been a long time since ive done it with college guys i think maybe i have a better empathy for what they go through because im going through the same things with my sons
4849904 everythings still kind of more or less in the dryer
4849905 oh yeah i should probably clean out the fridge a little

4849908 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
4849909 hey but what about such and such that happens all the time too
4849910 listen i know that the last time you came outside i was sitting out here and now you come outside again and see me sitting here but i have not been sitting out here the entire morning i swear since i saw you last i have been inside and have done 2 hours of very focused productive work now im taking a break
4849911 maybe this is just my own experience but it seems that when i tell people that im my own boss i must be making bank completely untrue although i think i do pretty well im not by any standard wealthy i pay my bills and thats about it
4849912 i didnt know you were that desperate for money i have a friend in hr who could probably get you an interview at the fortune 500 company i work at
4849913 for me it is not a problem and im not going to worry about it because he is going to be our player it is not a concern
4849914 at no point has robinho given the impression that he does not want to go to valencia
4849915 he is very well i have spoken with him and the player is in perfect shape
4849916 he is training normally is here to play and therefore he is going to play
4849917 i can only assess what robinho does here and with us everything is normal in the games he has played in pre season he has done very well played with a lot of joy and its the same in training
4849918 to those god gives more the more he asks of them
4849919 boligprisene er inter dependente og stokastiske og persepsjonen om kapitalgevinst er labil
4849920 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4849921 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
