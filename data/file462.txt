4620000 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour
4620001 i guess that coming from a kind of sister country australia theres a good vibe
4620002 if i keep playing solid golf it will all take care of itself
4620003 its that old clich about just taking one shot at a time
4620004 i didnt start out hitting it that good and then around the turn i got the feeling it might be a real good day
4620005 anytime you can turn that back nine in under par youre setting yourself up for a good round
4620006 i feel like im getting better at working the ball both ways and you have to do that out here be it with tree lines or the undulations in the fairways youve got to turn it both ways
4620007 yesterday i had a few more putts that went in than today for the most part it was just a consistent round of golf no big putts no big mistakes
4620008 its golf yeah it gets frustrating but theres so much golf to be played im going to work on it this afternoon and see if we cant capitalize on it tomorrow
4620009 geopolitical concerns and the realization that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4620010 papa en ik hebben veel gepraat en het gaat zo niet langer we hebben geen ruzie maar kunnen niet meer bij elkaar zijn
4620011 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4620012 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4620013 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement
4620014 were hitting a wall now and were so close to impeachment proceedings
4620015 its this commando thing of his his living here would be like a red rag to a bull he wants to be photographed playing golf and taking it easy
4620016 basically musharraf is being stubborn the two sides are playing brinkmanship
4620017 all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4620018 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out
4620019 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4620020 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4620021 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4620022 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4620023 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4620024 the olympic games is not a race which i ever want to watch on television and think what could i have done in there
4620025 you get in there and give it your best shot
4620026 obviously i could have done with more time and when your biggest week of actual running is two weeks before the race it is not an ideal preparation
4620027 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up what is the worst that can happen and are you ok to live with that but it is a calculated risk
4620028 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4620029 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
4620030 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
4620031 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
4620032 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
4620033 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
4620034 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
4620035 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
4620036 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4620037 was forced to adapt to a fast moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained lessons were learned the hard way
4620038 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff
4620039 facing a task for which it was not originally designed
4620040 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4620041 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4620042 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4620043 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4620044 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4620045 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4620046 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4620047 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4620048 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4620049 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4620050 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4620051 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4620052 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4620053 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4620054 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4620055 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4620056 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4620057 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4620058 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4620059 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4620060 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4620061 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4620062 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4620063 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4620064 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4620065 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4620066 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4620067 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort despite being urged not to
4620068 every day shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4620069 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4620070 it is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4620071 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4620072 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4620073 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4620074 it might actually have been useful considering two men with schizophrenia escaped from a mental hospital near exeter on tuesday night and everyones been very scared
4620075 sterling remains vulnerable especially against the us dollar the pound averaged 1 55 over 1993 2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12 18 months
4620076 the us was the first economy to hit trouble now people are realising that the uk has the same problems if not more so as the us
4620077 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4620078 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4620079 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook if next weeks us inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4620080 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end
4620081 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark
4620082 this week well be meeting tabitha shes a successful television presenter with her own production company but she doesnt know which lap dancing club her coke addled boyfriend is currently favouring and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more she recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home spiritually cleansed owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasnt worn the wrong thing since her second form end of term disco nonetheless she wouldnt be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without googling and cant find her own 40 000 wet room without her pa relaying directions via her blackberry tonight were going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu ometer then after weve talked her down from the ledge well have our regular consultant deirdre on hand to give tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection wont be conditional upon her haircut
4620083 but he wasnt going to go out because there were hints or suggestions that this is what he might do because he didnt want to be regarded as a coward
4620084 and in the end the cabinet didnt go to john howard as a united body and demand that he stood down
4620085 he spent 30 minutes telling me why peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter

4620093 sparked an increase in racist and white supremacist activity mainly on the internet according to leaders of hate groups and the organizations that track them
4620094 i get nonstop e mails and private message from new people who are mad as hell about the possibility of obama being elected
4620095 white people for a long time have thought of our government as being for us and obama is the best possible evidence that weve lost that this is scaring a lot of people who maybe never considered themselves racists and its bringing them over to our side
4620096 as it appeared on jul 21 2008 00 01 06 gmt
4620097 like most jews singer songwriter randy newman regards jews and whites as two different races of course when i do it im called all sorts of rude names
4620098 one thing ive wondered for a while is his obamas identification with the african part of his genetic makeup you know he is not an african american he is a mulatto that means he has a white and a black parent he is a mulatto he is neither white nor black
4620099 well if youre using the adls the anti defamation leagues version of a neo nazi meaning that im a white man proud of my heritage then youre damn right i am if thats what a neo nazi is then thats what i am and im proud to be and you should be too if you had any courage
4620100 disgusted with militant homosexuals who pervert the institution of marriage and who are conspiring to indoctrinate schoolchildren with the queer agenda

4620103 ok well i got this black blood in me im black
4620104 hey white people and black people cannot get along together lets separate peaceably
4620105 white people are unworthy to be included in the mass of humanity
4620106 yes there are black people there are mestizos there are asians and then theres this other group that doesnt even rate a name
4620107 well if youre using the adls version of a neo nazi meaning that im a white man proud of my heritage then youre damn right i am if thats what a neo nazi is then thats what i am and im proud to be and you should be too if you had any courage
4620108 w hat do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names

4620110 my bloke had been out of town on business for two weeks and i couldnt wait to see him
4620111 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in its latest monthly forecast yesterday
4620112 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in
4620113 geopolitical concerns and the realisation that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4620114 i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt
4620115 im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
4620116 dont they get sand in their suits diving around in the sand like that
4620117 if i only had my crack pipe it just might have kept me sane
4620118 instead of picking up the toaster and toasting half my brain
4620119 it was during the time when i was hanging out with pete doh
4620120 no the cult the culture of that time that whole obsession with the crack pipe has never kept anyone sane theres a lot of stuff in there that is very raw lyrically and theres a lot of stuff that is just complete and utter situationist mischief
4620121 we had this debate when we were writing lyrics are we swearing too much not because we think swearing is wrong but is it lazy
4620122 have some breakfast have a drink and get out of town
4620123 its the first time ive been on stage as me
4620124 and this may sound such a naff thing but in the initial daze of nervousness because i didnt have a character the sunglasses became so important i did two gigs in girls pink sunglasses ive got to wean myself off the shades
4620125 i was hoping theyd just give me a mannequin with a cock coming out its head we do share a very similar sense of humour
4620126 they do horrible clothes but they wanted non model models and they flew us out to milan and said you can have some free clobber
4620127 and im a fan of their work but they wouldnt have offered to do this if they didnt like the music theyre very particular people
4620128 its the first time in my life where im not the biggest cunt in the room
4620129 if you want to rob primrose hill tonights the night
4620130 every little thing you said would break me all of it came true every bit of love i give you mock it yes you do
4620131 i was i was in a bad way heartbroken its a diary in a way this album coz ive been through several states of mind through the process
4620132 fell off the train fell into the room daf stuck a mic in my face i thought it was a fucking ice cream i was that off me head
4620133 id split up with me girlfriend no no not the little one
4620134 jesus christ no she doesnt deserve a fucking song that one
4620135 it all had a kind of poetic symmetry im not the kind to lie down on a couch this band was bang on the right time
4620136 think youll find your glasses on the front page of most tabloids
4620137 afghanistan isnt like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective
4620138 this is not burma or thailand or mexico or colombia this is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction its so fragile and corruption is such an issue that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country destroying this government and pushing the nation into big time civil disorder why because you have so many people who can get so many weapons its entirely different im telling you
4620139 im sitting there thinking james bond and women and adventure so i called the toll free number
4620140 you actually had these guys on the streets wearing their big brimmed hats and fancy long coats and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls it was amazing just like you see on tv
4620141 from the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later they were wrong
4620142 theres got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law corruption and drugs otherwise you can forget it
4620143 its roundup my dad puts it on his weeds it doesnt mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in
4620144 we are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks
4620145 the owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood
4620146 there are a lot of wealthy people in afghanistan but the money is not here
4620147 getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in its about making sure innocent people are not in prison
4620148 it was just a way for him to get me out
4620149 none of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years they obviously did what they had to do americans want to think black and white but you gotta throw that out the window when you come to afghanistan everything here is a shade of grey
4620150 i have thoroughly investigated all these accusations and of course none of them are true
4620151 but we do not have good relations if i was governor the taliban would not have captured even five inches of land now they have five districts
4620152 oh lord have mercy on the soles of my people
4620153 i sort of knew when i came eer ze liverpool or arshenal one of zem we would draw we have a young team and to expereinsh bigggggg games he holds out his hands in a manner common to footballers denoting a particularly large pair of breasts championsh leeegue at home ze emirates will be fantasteeec for ze playez
4620154 i shay i think we are not just what you call underdogsh but masheev underdogsh there is no expectashun
4620155 please dont call me arrogant but im european champion and i think im a special one
4620156 yes i am special for my friends my family my country but as a manager so so
4620157 the speed is slower there is an imitation of phonological features he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check hes understood hes giving equal stress to each word this is classical trying to make yourself understood to a foreigner english its typical of the way english people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability
4620158 ten out of 10 for effort but there is a way of speaking slowly and clearly that doesnt make it sound as if youre treating them like idiots
4620159 i couldnt settle in italy it was like living in a foreign country
4620160 i yearn for my mothers bread and my mothers coffee
4620161 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanise and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
4620162 i would not have returned a good morning to many of those who now say they are my friends
4620163 i just dumped a bloke after wed spent a couple of nights together because he didnt fit me
4620164 but i carried on with the plans to pose that wed been talking about because he left his newcummers in my flat when he walked out in a huff im not your normal girl next door type and i never want to be i dont dress like it or act like it and i dont expect to be treated like it i posed to shock people i know and excite blokes i dont know fair enough all my friends know that i always do everything to the extreme
4620165 i guess thats why when i went online to buy my first sex toys i got a couple of the biggest ones i could see i didnt consider anything smaller they were rather intimidating at first but i soon got used to them now i love the totally filled up feelings i get with one toy in my twat and one in my bum and my orgasms are always fabulous i sometimes use the toys in front of my bloke but i wont let him use them on me you should have seen his face when i asked sweetly if hed like me to use one in his bum the size of a blokes thingie is very important to me
4620166 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4620167 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies
4620168 we have no idea where the future is headed but weve got you covered
4620169 look you dont have to wait 8 years for an electric car or spend 80 000 on a hybrid suv we have eco friendly options right now today
4620170 id liked him to have had more summer league experience but i dont think it will be a factor down the road walsh said as far as the posts report they have agreed to terms on a guaranteed contract with combo guard anthony roberson walsh said emphatically the decision on whether to eat stephon marburys 21 million contract has not been made but roberson looks to be a keeper for this season not just a training camp invitee to saratoga sources said theyll have to cut one guaranteed contract unless a 2 for 1 deal is made and it probably wont be roberson posted by marc berman on july 16 2008 03 57 pm comments im suprised that donnie and danti did not check his back number he might look young outside of of himself but could be very old inside cutting him open to check is probably imoral and he would have to heel up but its fishy he never complaned until today i hope he didnt take any tips from mudbury and learnt the wrongway before he goes home what else did go wrong we need good brakes to win this year i dont know about you posted by heri on july 16 2008 04 13 pm wow im shocked mayo love bayless ballin out of control and hes shelve for the whole summer not a good sign blame isiah for this lol j posted by zeke on july 16 2008 04 59 pm russell westbrook is also playing welll for the sonics roberson is a nice addition he can flat out shoot the rock and knows how to score kind of similiar to nate robinson in some ways posted by fordy on july 16 2008 05 19 pm sure could use more nate robinsons on the team great for chemistry winning screaming down 30 points manly hes like gilligan lost on an island and your little buddy posted by chevy on july 16 2008 05 33 pm i was speaking with a news analyst for an italian television station who told me as a matter of fact that its widely known that gallinari has had back problems since he started dating a 68
4620171 it was a great draft for the nets because i think brook lopez could be really special
4620172 were going to find the bad people who steal children
4620173 everything is rosy and wonderful and heres your complimentary pack of butterflies and rainbows to shove up your butt
4620174 renaldo really had no role after we drafted gallinari and with the emergence of wilson chandler his minutes would be nonexistent
4620175 so it really wasnt fair to him to keep him in a spot that he wouldnt play and also gives us an opportunity to clear up a roster spot and move on
4620176 players like jarred jeffries jerome james mardy collins has to leave they cant fit our has the quality to play in dantoni system i think that he should trade curry for a more energetic atlhetic center pf

4620190 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4620191 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4620192 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4620193 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4620194 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4620195 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4620196 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2

4620210 its one of the funniest scripts ive ever read but i was filled with dread about the water buffalo scenes i have a lot of scenes with this water buffalo i have to be strapped to the back of it in my underpants for a few scenes
4620211 im fine with being embarrassed its just being in actual physical peril i will do almost anything for a laugh but i dont want to die
4620212 at one point i did get flipped off the back of the buffalo it didnt want me up there
4620213 it was a showbiz buffalo you can say that about a showbiz great white shark you can say dont worry about it its showbiz you cant take its natural inclination that is to be a thousand pounds of muscle and do bad stuff

4620219 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable
4620220 do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you
4620221 your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine

4620223 sipping the guest longed to sip again but the wine demanded so deliberate a pause in order to detect the hidden peculiarities and subtle exquisiteness of its flavour that to drink it was really more a moral than a physical enjoyment there was a deliciousness in it that eluded analysis and like whatever else is superlatively good was perhaps better appreciated in the memory than by present consciousness
4620224 so does our individual fate exist in the limestone of time we fancy that we carve it out but its ultimate shape is prior to all our action
4620225 the entire system of mans affairs as at present established is built up purposely to exclude the careless and happy soul
4620226 is sin then which we deem such a dreadful blackness in the universe is it like sorrow merely an element of human education through which we struggle to a higher and purer state than we could otherwise have attained did adam fall that we might ultimately rise to a far loftier paradise than his

4620294 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try to hold it
4620295 if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance
4620296 in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increasingly heavy we wont be able to carry on
4620297 as with the glass of water you have to put it down for a
4620298 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work life down dont carry it home you can pick it up tomorrow

4620312 los cuales le vamos a ir contando a las autoridades
4620313 nosotros lo que queremos hacer es un gran esfuerzo para que la gente denuncie todo lo que tenga que ver con ese delito
4620314 yo creo que en este momento nuestros pol ticos tienen que estar a la altura todos porque este es un problema de los gobiernos estatales del distrito federal y del gobierno federal pero principalmente en el tema del secuestro es de los gobiernos estatales y queremos que est n a la altura de los ciudadanos
4620315 me parece que si alguien que secuestra a un menor de edad o secuestra a una persona y la mutila o la asesina no merece salir nunca de la c rcel
4620316 es mi opini n y la sostengo en cualquier terreno
4620317 pero un viaje de mil millas comienza con un paso
4620318 podamos reunirnos gobernadores autoridades y sociedad civil para revisar la agenda que tenemos en materia de seguridad
4620319 a la cual no vamos a prestar o dos sordos los gobernantes estoy seguro

4620325 that way goals which can be achieved easily can also exist along side the goals which cannot be achieved easily
4620326 well people who look for challenges in life simply because they want to face challenges worry me because such people are very weak they usually simply want to prove to themselves or others that they are better
4620327 is a goal some people are out to achieve maybe they are similarly people who keep avoiding obstacles and living a life without obstacles usually end up not doing much
4620328 of course once you are aiming for something then you can look for challenges or try your best to avoid them
4620329 i want to marry the hottest woman in the world
4620330 i want to make it my lifes goal to write music and support myself by doing so
4620331 another sign that many people encounter may not only say
4620332 but also show you an outlined person falling down on a huge yellow placard sign who could have thought that trash cans now are moody and only like certain kinds of trash to be put inside of them
4620333 i guess i should be grateful for the existence of such people without them people like me would either have gone extinct long time ago or would have never existed
4620334 has become the universal law upon which twittering for many people revolves around
4620335 we really appreciate it the guy came and accepted the opportunity to do something thats foreign to him and thats a part time role
4620336 he was working on his swing and at the same time sporadic play i dont think is conducive to him at his stage of his career
4620337 we just felt it was time for him to go work on some things
4620338 we cant forget how young melky is and sometimes its difficult to work on things here we talked about some things offensively and we talked about some things with baserunning we felt that melky was growing defensively as a player but we just felt it was time now
4620339 i never thought this was going to happen thats the managers decision

4620345 en ese contexto debemos sentirnos tranquilos de las cifras que hoy tenemos
4620346 mitos itu sangat berpengaruh negatif bagi fungsi seksual perempuan banyak perempuan yang menjadi lebih tertutup dalam menghadapi masalah seksual
4620347 i think project x should be put at the top of the list
4620348 i have a lunch appointment and i need to go soon
4620349 my action in such a case was preemptive i slapped even before you slapped me or showed signs that you were going to slap me 1
4620350 while you chase me thus a preemptive action is not an action that is the only solution to something that can happen it is an action that the preemptive person or entity chooses to take
4620351 walk away and let the gossips start launch a preemptive gossip yourself against the gossipers
4620352 wait a few hours while they search you your house your car or anything else you own check your background and your dna and your blood and your pockets before they scratch their heads in confusion please note they might recommend or order you to go through a psych test to see if you are crazy or not
4620353 and walk away keep looking back to see how the stranger looks at you or if the stranger comes after you to slap you
4620354 see their reaction and make a note of it in your friendship diary see how many friends start calling you fewer times after that
4620355 see whether or not you can end up making the sales associate call for the manager
4620356 and close the door without letting them in see what happens and see if they ring the door bell to ask what is going on
4620357 everything that follows will test your preemptive initiative oath if you laugh and simply walk out you were only a prankster playing a prank
4620358 to everything what that saying means that since something has already happened there is no need to worry or stop over it forgive and forget or forget and repeat the forgetting is the central theme in such an initiative
4620359 are you starting to understand the power of the bes bygone initiative now
4620360 other people will love you for saying that and flock around you to see who this smart person is or they will simply tell you they forgot to do something and walk away
4620361 with the bygone initiative you will feel happier in a more sincere manner and naturally instead of forcing yourself to feel happier or to put on a fake attitude of positiveness since you will realize that negative things can happen and that all you can do is to focus on now and the upcoming history instead of only your past
4620362 you end up in canada and you tell the passenger
4620363 its already happened already bought things and paid for them lets forgive and forget shall we
4620364 unfortunately you will realize that the credit card companies and their allies of today are not true believers of the bygone initiative
4620365 yes im thinking the same question bes zs poor practical guide to surviving without much money part 1 electricity usage
4620366 with a weird face and you can walk out with a weirded smiling face if you wish if you can find even a single store that is willing to give you such batteries every 2 to 3 weeks or even every month or two you may never have to buy those aa sized batteries for many months or years to come
4620367 every day you see dozens of tourists coming to malls and taking pictures to which no one objects
4620368 i thought about it and showed him a few pictures taken a few years ago with my canon but i told him they were all from the newer sony camera
4620369 whoa you took time to do that just to make a website
4620370 a term that describes the stereotypical things and traits associated with stereotypical males
4620371 such is the mentality we hold in life when it comes to the role of genders on our planet
4620372 the day you start realizing how to look at issues without putting gender into the question will be the day you can start realizing why things are happening
4620373 6 real people who want real relationships can slowly realize whether or not they are being sincerely appreciated by their significant others
4620374 from people who never help you when you need help but they say such things when they need your help why would you accept a relationship where you are rarely appreciated sincerely
4620375 so i always have tried to focus on fewer or no rewards in relationships other than the mental ones
4620376 never try to change or ask someone in a relationship to change for you accept people 100 for what they are
4620377 are fools and not your friends such people are those who do not change anything in the world and wish to be dictated around because they are too weak to realize something may be wrong in different things in the universe
4620378 you should actually think as to what makes you unhappy or unsatisfied and talk to your significant other about it
4620379 we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffs up but love edifies
4620380 the precise sequence of events that appears in a static text
4620381 i hate those black bars covering up half the picture
4620382 theres even less of it now than there was before
4620383 every time she needs to reinvent herself she manages to do it from that sexy kind of symbolism that she brings with her clothing to the more sophisticated glamour now i mean shes everchanging
4620384 the view then was oh its just another white girl singing soul and i said no i think theres a bit more to this one
4620385 so i fetched up to interview her i was the first interview down the first of the afternoon her first interview in england and no one else turned up so i ended up spending the whole afternoon with her
4620386 we are all scrutinising her body and her face everyones talking about how veiny she looks if shes ageing and whether her body is looking a bit more androgynous this week
4620387 our report suggests that a large proportion of parents see their childs independent adult life starting when they are in their 30s
4620388 this is likely to put a financial strain on parents as they approach retirement age
4620389 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4620390 recognise the territorial integrity of georgia and recognise that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia

4620392 relationship between globally dispersed yet collectively self identified ethnic groups and their countries of origin and settlement
4620393 the full implications of this activity have yet to be determined
4620394 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
4620395 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
4620396 which is the main reason why im not going to take public funding away from catholic schools
4620397 its nice to see so many people coming out and supporting a message of acceptance
4620398 im definitely glad to see we can get a strong reaction out of a small community
4620399 i was kind of concerned the protest itself would eclipse the play
4620400 were in a conservative province and to find 100 people able to come out on a hot sunny friday night to stand up against hate speaks volumes
4620401 there is no doubt that his diverse knowledge and extensive involvement in strengthening relations with scientific communities will be of great value to the council
4620402 the separation of church and state an important principle to be preserved does not mean that we can or should keep faith perspectives from influencing political decisions or vice versa we cannot profess to be a free society and a representative democracy and impose a de facto ban on expression or consideration of spiritual views in the political arena
4620403 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
4620404 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
4620405 sheikh azizs death is big loss to kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
4620406 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
4620407 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
4620408 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4620409 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4620410 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4620411 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4620412 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4620413 theres a sense today that college students are very busy with their schedules and their lives and in order for them to take time out they need to be incentivized
4620414 if you believe that judaism is a viable religion for many different reasons and youre able to show it in a way thats truly meaningful thats truly exciting
4620415 and i dont think you need to pay people to do that
4620416 we simply want to try to introduce young jews who havent had the opportunity to learn about judaism
4620417 they go to university and might be well versed about science mathematics and literature but their jewish education may be very fragile
4620418 aishcafe was kind of the beginning of wanting to know more about judaism and really identify with my judaic roots
4620419 to me it was an avenue for religious growth that was something i wanted to do for a while and this was an opportunity to do it
4620420 i really felt i had something i could relate to
4620421 for me and for a lot of people theres a sense that religion can be backwards but this shows it in another light
4620422 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available ole hansen
4620423 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
4620424 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room he said
4620425 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment said hansen

4620445 deet has been shown to be an extremely safe and effective repellent
4620446 natural is a word that is sometimes used to promote safe products unfortunately the wording can be misleading for the uninformed individual natural products are usually essential oils distilled from plants these oils can be toxic and irritating in high concentrations natural repellents are not necessarily safe repellents
4620447 there is no scientific evidence that eating garlic vitamins onions or any other food will make a person repellent to mosquitoes
4620448 it is also unlikely that b 1 skin patches will work either
4620449 there is no evidence that wearing devices that emit sound will repel mosquitoes
4620450 bug zappers do not control mosquitoes and can reduce the populations of beneficial insects
4620451 the truth is although many home remedies and oddball uses of everyday products do serve to repel mosquitoes somewhat they dont work very effectively for very long

4620474 the game is a multi directional shooter in the vein of thrust and gravitar the players craft is subject to inertia but not drag so to stop moving in one direction it needs to thrust in the opposite way the constant pull of gravity makes stable flight impossible and steering a skill in itself solar jetman has twelve planets and one hidden planet each with its own gravity and system of enemy infested caverns the goal is to navigate these caves with small jetpods launched from an immobile mothership on each world bringing back a piece of the warpship and enough fuel to journey to the next one items are collected with a tractor beam tow cable that complicates flight much further and released over the mothership or deposited in small wormholes deeper in the caverns points are earned by retrieving valuables and destroying enemies and can be spent after every other stage to buy power ups both pod specific and permanent the most vital ones are found on the field if a pod is destroyed the pilot ejects in an agile but feeble spacesuit and can be returned to the ship or a wormhole for another craft losing a spacesuit costs one of four lives
4620475 the main goal of each level is to bring enough fuel to the main ship to blast off again but before you do you must first collect a piece of a legendary spaceship the golden warpship which was broken into 12 pieces when your spaceship is destroyed you are left along on the planet in just your spacesuit luckily its also equipped with a gun and thrusters but it cant be upgraded besides with different bullets but as a last resort it can be rather handy but one shot is lethal

4620480 modern day adventurers who take on exciting and often dangerous trips for the benefit of others
4620481 youll stand out from the other graduates if you organised your own trip advertised what you were doing and thought up something really different you are bound to impress employers
4620482 the idea was appealing because the country crosses so many different terrains theres patagonia in the south then the middle is mediterranean in climate and the north is dry we literally got a map and pointed and said well go from there to there
4620483 we were a bit naive when we started out we had to take the pedals off our bikes to get them on the plane and we put them back on wrongly and had to find someone to sort our bikes out as soon as we got there we were very confident travellers by the end though
4620484 we realised that our bikes were ill equipped for the terrain although they were new then the patagonian wind whipped everything off the bikes so wed be chasing around for our sleeping bags and tents
4620485 we would meet quite a few long distance cyclists on our route which was fun one of the main things we got to appreciate was how fantastic it was to cycle everywhere you get invited to sleep in peoples homes in churches and in schools it was the best way to see somewhere and it was cheap
4620486 it cost us less than 2 000 together in flights bikes and living costs
4620487 we got great satisfaction from planning the adventure ourselves but i made sure i spoke to plenty of experts we asked long distance cyclists one of whom literally turned up on my doorstep to tell me his tips i emailed people i found who had done similar things
4620488 the penguins moult like dogs and it was breeding season so all the chicks were hatching the penguins couldnt go into the sea while they moulted so they couldnt get food to feed their chicks we rescued hundreds of chicks and gave them a health check
4620489 we were invited to release the birds back into the sea when they had been rehabilitated
4620490 i went on my own and met people out there i wanted to organise my gap year adventure myself inventing your own itinerary and planning your year yourself gives you a sense of independence it was also a lot cheaper that way
4620491 we had lost three stone each and it took about five to six weeks to recover
4620492 above 8 000m your body starts to break down and the cells dont replace themselves i looked like an eight year old
4620493 we had a focal point and then it was all over leaving us feeling awful
4620494 years ago i wouldnt have fallen through the ice because it wouldnt have been so thin
4620495 you might be more likely to get sponsorship and you might get local press coverage
4620496 the big corporates get approached by so many people i sent 150 letters and i got two hits
4620497 i had to work hard to convince people i was passionate about the charity they thought i just wanted to do the trip and should pay for it myself
4620498 after a year studying medical engineering at the university of bath i felt quite unfulfilled and decided to take a gap year to see what life was about i travelled in south america turkey italy and spain until i ran out of money and then worked in bars teaching english and driving quarrying machinery until i had enough money to continue my adventures what i really wanted to do was volunteer abroad but i couldnt afford the gap year industrys expensive all inclusive packages so in the end i travelled to bolivia with no contacts and by pure luck i linked up with a charity out there i didnt intend to found a business that year but i was frustrated that people like me were prevented from working with charities because of the cost and i had the idea of starting travellingbug i set up my company so that volunteers pay 350 for their own individual placement including a 100 donation to the charity in the first pilot trip with one charity and one group of students we took just under 3 000 and secured 6 000 through business competitions ive invested revenue back into the company and into our partner charity in bolivia so this year we have availability for 50 volunteers its going really well we now also work in uganda travellingbug is now my post uni employment plan my gap year was a great time to start being an entrepreneur because i had a lot of time on my hands im now back at university but travellingbug is still a full time job so last year i took on a fellow student as a business partner it can be hard to focus completely on studying i try to attend all my lectures but its not easy having said that my uni has been really supportive im a member of the universitys sife students in free enterprise team involved in educating people in ethical business sifes staff and other students help me to keep travellingbug growing in the right direction we work together sharing our time and ideas and the buzz must be catching because my flatmates are eager to start up their own business ideas i cant wait to get behind them my family are proud of my independence but they keep my feet on the ground they get the occasional shout from me to say mum that was the guardian on the phone but it doesnt seem to get me anything extra in my christmas stocking
4620499 when i was 17 i was out sailing with friends when i realised there was a need for a recovery device that could rescue an unconscious person overboard with the aid of just one person i was in sixth form at the time and when i was asked to design something for the community for my a level in product design my idea came back to me that day hypohoist a simple device to get people out of the water was born i had always planned to take a gap year but my intention was to do work experience at a hospital as i was aiming to study medicine but hypohoist changed my plans when i won the title of young engineer of britain in 2005 i decided to use my gap year to get my product into production i had to apply for a patent and get advice from a designer and engineer about how to make it commercially viable and then had to get it tested and approved next i had to find a partner company to manufacture and distribute the product before i finally had the big international launch at southampton boat show it was a busy year i also spent time promoting engineering to other young people i didnt plan the year just took it as it came and there were downsides because i was working constantly i missed two holidays so i could get my product launched but through the hypohoist i did get to travel to america representing britain as a young engineer and to denmark where i took part in an international competition when i started at uni studying design and engineering at brunel university after my gap year at first i found the age gap between myself and the others in my year a bit difficult my whole work ethic and schedule were completely different but i settled in and since then everything has happened fast i won the enterprising young brits award supported by the make your mark entrepreneurship campaign and that opened loads of doors for me to develop my product as well as my business and my personal skills sales are going very well and the money im making is helping towards my university fees and savings while at uni ive scaled down the time i spend on my product i put project work first because thats my real future i have to focus on new projects to diversify my skills and widen my knowledge but my gap year launching hypohoist has taken me on a truly life changing journey that i will remember for ever
4620500 some of the big agencies are using the environment as a kind of marketing tool and actually what theyre selling are essentially holidays
4620501 the rationale behind a lot of these projects is that youre getting people involved and engaged in the environment but if theyre only going out there for two weeks i dont see how that can be possible
4620502 some of them are certainly part of authentic scientific research expeditions but you need to establish very thoroughly before you go that this is the case what is the organisation you will be working with do they have plans to publish their research
4620503 what i was actually doing wasnt truly benefiting the local community we did build a playground and they were totally grateful it was a western ideal and it made me realise that i did it for my own selfish reasons
4620504 last summer i went to a christian festival with the hope of getting ideas of something different i could do with my gap year there i heard a talk by patrick regan the founder of xlp an urban youth charity about working with kids in a disadvantaged area who are not in school within the peckham area of london i was blown away by it and decided i wanted to do that i had hoped to get into cambridge to do medicine and was going to reapply after doing my gap year i thought my gap year would give me a chance to go away and experience something that would contribute to my career as a doctor but a couple of months in i changed my mind it was after seeing the impact of what the charity did working with children on estates who felt alienated from school and society and helping them fulfil their potential seeing these kids changed my perspective on life and i decided that medicine maybe wasnt the right thing for me to do now ive decided to work with the salvation army and do a youth worker degree at spurgeons college in london and study and work around there im really pleased i did the gap year it has changed my life completely i was brought up in a quiet little town so to suddenly be in peckham where there is a knife crime problem and young people are being stabbed really opened my eyes if youve been stuck in the education system its a good idea to take a gap year and experience what life is like in the real world
4620505 ive been working as a healthcare assistant in cardiff since january i had already applied to do the degree and deferred entry having worked over the past several months its confirmed for me that this is what i want to do im really looking forward to going to university it has given me an insight into what it will be like to study nursing now that im doing this im much more confident about going on to university this time out has given me the chance to get first hand experience i wanted to do something that would help me in the future rather than just the travel thing some of my friends have gone travelling but theyve done it for a reason such as a medical programme or something that will help their jobs during my time as a healthcare assistant ive had to work on a portfolio which will be good practice for my degree i get paid 6 an hour which im saving for when i go to university it takes six months to qualify as a healthcare assistant and two months to do the portfolio after that i think my pay goes up and i get a new uniform i would definitely advise other students to use their gap year to road test a degree or career even if youve already applied for university its a good move to get deferred entry and see what opportunities are out there everyone thinks that a gap year is all about travelling but its not the only thing to do
4620506 for us its really easy to say the group of 10s proposal is a bad proposal and it should not be the starting point for any legislation
4620507 i get straight as so i must have no social life
4620508 im overweight so i must have a self control problem
4620509 why should i not allow the child a bit of pleasure by enjoying my shop when she has no money to purchase such things

4620516 it seems like everyone knows what they want in their life it seems like everyone has all of these people in their lives to laugh with and to talk to and to tell secrets to and to bond with and im all by myself everyones got it so figured out
4620517 i wonder if anyone else in the whole world feels the things i feel or if theres another person out there that knows these exact feelings and are experiencing them at this very second
4620518 do you have any plans for the night its the weekend you know why dont you call someone up and find something fun to do
4620519 when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend
4620520 its not like i need to be going out doing all of these maniacal things that these kids do anyhow i dont know what is more maniacal the fact that these kids ingest and chug down these ridiculous illegal substances and do all of these ridiculous things when they are under the influence of these maniacal substances or the fact that they think there is nothing maniacal about doing these things
4620521 when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend

4620538 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4620539 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4620540 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4620541 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4620542 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy
4620543 the bnps attempts to present a respectable image are still masking some deeply disturbing underlying views
4620544 there is a gypsy problem there whats wrong with people who talk frankly about their problems
4620545 the action is surprising the community in blackburn is mainstream any act of terrorism not only does it give a bad name to islam and muslims it has an adverse reaction on race relations
4620546 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us
4620547 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4620548 they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4620549 they were quite a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4620550 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up the uk is fast becoming the obesity capital of the world and the effect of spiralling obesity amongst children is particularly worrying
4620551 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services
4620552 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4620553 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4620554 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
4620555 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
4620556 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
4620557 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
4620558 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
4620559 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
4620560 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
4620561 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4620562 sterling remains vulnerable especially against the us dollar the pound averaged 1 55 over 1993 2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12 18 months
4620563 the us was the first economy to hit trouble now people are realising that the uk has the same problems if not more so as the us
4620564 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4620565 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4620566 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook if next weeks us inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4620567 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end
4620568 todas as vezes que eu joguei contra times da inglaterra nesta pr temporada eu fui muito elogiado pela imprensa inglesa ningu m aqui contestou minha contrata o imprensa ou torcida o primeiro jogo meu em casa foi semana passada contra o roma vit ria por 5 a 0 e fui muito bem recebido eu me senti como se estivesse jogando aqui h muito tempo estou muito feliz com nessa nova etapa e agora tenho de fazer o que sei n o deixar a bola entrar de maneira alguma

4620572 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing
4620573 and dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4620574 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4620575 and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning it means we havent lost an officer overnight
4620576 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight
4620577 ive been failed by every single service that was supposed to help me apart from the haven sexual assault referral centre a confidential service in south london
4620578 i did my bit in reporting a rapist and the authorities didnt do theirs instead they made my life hell it has exhausted me
4620579 i thought if i take this money every penny of it will be tainted
4620580 to discover that the police had lost the file was the worst time in all of it
4620581 ill never get that time back i havent had a job i dont know if ill ever be able to work full time before i got my award i was living in poverty in a council flat i was unable to furnish
4620582 ive lost most of my friends its destroyed my social life ive lost those really important years the years when everyone else builds a career and finds a boyfriend and gets a dog
4620583 im going to end up using the money i fought so hard for to continue doing other peoples bloody jobs
4620584 they needed a stronger voice and someone said why not stand
4620585 i thought councillors were not quite members of the human race
4620586 with a very strong ethic for helping others deeply committed to their jobs i dont like people being rude about local government particularly our social services staff who do a fantastic job
4620587 if you really want to change lives the biggest change you can make is to allow them to be independent
4620588 if you dont have that youre fundamentally trapped its the great slavery of the day isnt it
4620589 in their hearts labour believes in the state and it is deeply ingrained
4620590 for conservatives and certainly for myself the opposite is true our ultimate belief is about freedom independence individualism the characteristics that made this country great
4620591 old style patrician tory with a very strong social conscience and a great sense of humour
4620592 aside from the duke of wellington it was the unlikely pairing of nelson mandela and madonna
4620593 sandy had a strong social conscience a zest for life courage determination and a passionate commitment to public service
4620594 but it wasnt just the rich and grand places he loved he also treasured the hidden heritage of ordinary people in the rural farmhouses and the urban terraces in the seaside at margate and in the suburbs of maidstone and chatham
4620595 the evidence strongly suggests that there is next to no chance of people in sunderland having the same opportunities as the people of birmingham or portsmouth
4620596 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland
4620597 i was thankful it was still standing because i hated to think of it being down to the ground
4620598 the only thing i can say is im going to get busy and try to star over and restore some things some things you cant replace i think the person would be a sick person to do something like this i just wondered if they had ever been in the house
4620599 because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation
4620600 this conflict begins with dietary advice much of which is hard to interpret what for example does it really mean to consume a variety of nutrient dense foods and beverages within and among the basic food groups as advised by the
4620601 single nutrients and foods are easier to talk about than messy dietary patterns and they are much easier to study but you are better off paying attention to your overall dietary pattern than worrying about whether any one single food is better for you than another
4620602 its not a function of household income its a function of household spending
4620603 when you start working and youre in an environment where everyone is living the high life you get caught up in that spending in a way its actually harder for people with good paying jobs to live frugally
4620604 these laws just three of 178 new laws will help coloradans fight back against the health insurance industry when they dont play fair
4620605 one new law will prohibit agents from selling misleading insurance policies another will give consumers an apples to apples shopping guide to health plans and the third law will require insurance companies to pay what they owe when they owe it
4620606 its our job in government to protect consumers from unfair business practices
4620607 insurance companies should play fair stick to their promises and pay what they owe

4620612 was forced to adapt to a fast moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained lessons were learned the hard way
4620613 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff
4620614 facing a task for which it was not originally designed
4620615 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4620616 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4620617 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4620618 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4620619 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4620620 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4620621 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4620622 what you see here at the moment is the communities moving forward and that is unstoppable we know paramilitaries are still trying to recruit some of those we are arresting are young people who would have no notion of what it was like in the troubles the glorious days of revolution that never existed stuff and people who are pretty unbalanced and dysfunctional but they are dangerous we know they are determined to attack and kill police and we have been lucky frankly
4620623 some poor victim would have a conversation with a police helmet
4620624 collusion the c word first we have to be clear there was without doubt collusion in some cases between security services and the paramilitaries was it endemic no it was not was it institutionalised no it was not that doesnt mean it didnt happen
4620625 leave with dignity at huge cost to my organisation in terms of experience was critical
4620626 it did give people an opportunity to move away if they didnt want to be part of a new world
4620627 generally speaking in britain senior leaders of the police service are pretty anonymous
4620628 here it is totally different and i misjudged that badly everything the police did was interpreted in a political way and in directly opposing ways by different sides
4620629 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with was that police business i would argue that it was the work we did in the states for the last six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4620630 once a year to tell him about policing and that its working its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4620631 i got flak last week for speaking to the representatives of loyalist paramilitaries the uda
4620632 wow he hates me with a vengeance i have a very basic benchmark i will talk to anyone who wants to make a contribution to policing
4620633 i fully understood that it would be deeply offensive at the time to talk to some of the people i spoke to but it was the right thing to do because it moved the world on
4620634 when i first met them i put an email out saying heres what im doing and heres why im doing it most cops with a lot of service said good luck if this means my kids dont have to go through what i went through im all for it
4620635 the point was an awful lot of people who are so called al qaida are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british the more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way theyre going
4620636 what we must have is a system in place pre event because all the lessons from knee jerk legislation from the dangerous dogs act onwards is that you get something unworkable chaotic and probably more draconian
4620637 my fear is that in the absence of proper legislation the temptation will be to charge people early to take risks and it will fall apart 10 20 years down the line
4620638 if that means on day 28 and one second someone who i suspect deeply of a huge outrage that i cannot charge them with will walk out the door society will have to judge government on that not me
4620639 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight thats the world we live in
4620640 it was tiresome and hurtful at the time but i have no difficulty with a journalist making observations about my personal life provided theyre accurate
4620641 when someone says something that goes to the heart of my integrity around money which is a downright lie i think you have no option but to sue when they refuse to retract it but youve got to live with what people write
4620642 it is a great privilege to run this organisation and i have no plans at all to move at the moment but one day
4620643 it is better to have a leader who is good at pr
4620644 image is important but it shouldnt distract us from the big arguments
4620645 cameron provides the pr it is his unreformed and grumpy team that are setting the same old tory policy agenda
4620646 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4620647 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4620648 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that

4620728 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark
4620729 this week well be meeting tabitha shes a successful television presenter with her own production company but she doesnt know which lap dancing club her coke addled boyfriend is currently favouring and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more she recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home spiritually cleansed owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasnt worn the wrong thing since her second form end of term disco nonetheless she wouldnt be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without googling and cant find her own 40 000 wet room without her pa relaying directions via her blackberry tonight were going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu ometer then after weve talked her down from the ledge well have our regular consultant deirdre on hand to give tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection wont be conditional upon her haircut

4620733 yes i am special for my friends my family my country but as a manager so so
4620734 the speed is slower there is an imitation of phonological features he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check hes understood hes giving equal stress to each word this is classical trying to make yourself understood to a foreigner english its typical of the way english people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability
4620735 ten out of 10 for effort but there is a way of speaking slowly and clearly that doesnt make it sound as if youre treating them like idiots

4620740 anytime we can promote the health of babies and get moms back to work its a good situation for everyone
4620741 with healthier infants fewer working mothers will miss work to stay home with a sick child this is the right thing for moms for healthy babies and for a productive workplace
4620742 businesses recognize the value of healthy children and how that increases the productivity and morale of working mothers
4620743 returning to paid work is one of the biggest reasons mothers quit breast feeding we are delighted to help remove this obstacle for colorado moms and were ready to help employers implement simple inexpensive solutions to comply with the law while positively impacting their bottom lines
4620744 the law is especially significant for lower income mothers who are less likely to have accommodation in the workplace
4620745 in settings such as restaurants call centers retail stores hotels and resorts factories and food processing plants it can be particularly challenging for women to obtain break time and access to private areas other than toilet stalls where they can express milk
4620746 we will focus a good deal of our energy reaching out to employers and mothers in environments where workers have less autonomy and flexibility and facilities have limited space for designated lactation areas
4620747 there are creative solutions for all types of scenarios its a matter of awareness education and expert assistance and support thats where the coalition can help
4620748 a strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger it implies anxiety and usually the loss of courage
4620749 unfortunately the likelihood that fire will encroach on our mountain and rural communities increases as those communities boom
4620750 as the state and in particular our mountain communities continue to grow we need to provide firefighting personnel with new resources and strategies so they can effectively continue protect colorado
4620751 i am thankful to be having this month of refreshment
4620752 i feel it is necessary to provide a post that expalins this 6 month hiatus from the blog
4620753 they concluded rationing was the only way to achieve dramatic cuts without feeding inflation or causing social unrest
4620754 would improve on the system preventing black markets in unused coupons
4620755 the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must
4620756 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments
4620757 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
4620758 they seem to say that since we cant stop russia militarily there is nothing else we can do

4620761 the europeans dont much like the idea of any of this so this week they demonstrated the same sort of resolve that they showed in the balkans in the early 1990s when they stood by as genocide unfolded on their own continent
4620762 nicolas sarkozy the french president in his capacity as head pro tempore of the eu came back from a trip to moscow and tbilisi waving a piece of paper and acclaiming peace in our time
4620763 but the one sided ceasefire that he negotiated was more or less dictated to him by mr putin it not only left the russian military in place in the disputed enclaves it allowed them free rein to continue operations inside the rest of georgia

4620819 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4620820 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4620821 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4620822 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4620823 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4620824 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4620825 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california

4620829 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4620830 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4620831 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4620832 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4620833 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4620834 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4620835 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4620836 hes not saying hi hes not waving to me hi daddy
4620837 more needs to be done to make the subject relevant and more engaging for pupils
4620838 recent annual subject reports by ofsted have highlighted weaknesses in geography in primary and secondary schools and have provided some evidence of decline in the overall quality of provision
4620839 it is important that the citizens of tomorrow understand the management of risk appreciate diversity are aware of environmental issues promote sustainability and respect human rights and social inclusion
4620840 if the aspiration of schools is to create pupils who are active and well rounded citizens there is no more relevant subject than geography
4620841 last year we made radical reforms to the geography curriculum to make it more engaging and more relevant to young peoples lives bringing in topics like environmental change and sustainable development but keeping the essential basics of maps and globes and atlases
4620842 an innovative new gcse is being piloted that captures the relevance and excitement of contemporary geography
4620843 geography is an important subject which helps young people analyse explore and question the world in which we live we know we need to enthuse young people about geography
4620844 fundamentally the provision of good geography teaching lies with the teachers themselves
4620845 whilst there are many examples of good geography teaching we need non specialist and the less motivated specialist teachers to be encouraged to raise their game
4620846 we will do all that we can to support teachers in achieving that
4620847 geography can be a practical and varied subject but this report suggests it is at risk of becoming too dry
4620848 overly bureaucratic health and safety concerns should not be allowed to prevent schools from involving pupils in engaging and interesting fieldwork projects

4620876 there are agencies that work for russia but i dont know how they can be comfortable about that
4620877 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
4620878 no offence was intended by the advert but whether the chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for spanish sport
4620879 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4620880 members of the madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the guardians accusation exists a plan by certain people in the anglo saxon world to dirty spains name over their bid for the games
4620881 it seems that no one read the original i didnt accuse anyone of anything
4620882 in bad faith by some members of the press so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action
4620883 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4620884 i would like to say that we have a huge respect for the orient and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china and one of our spanish national team sponsors is the chinese brand li ning
4620885 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4620886 but we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever so as far as we are concerned the matter rests
4620887 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the us there would be suspensions
4620888 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4620889 we will be spending a lot more than we are raising now

4620919 i made two errors of judgment in my days at elektra and jobriath was one of them
4620920 a flashy an provocative debut album jobriath brings to rock a voice uncannily reminiscent of mick jaggers and a theatrical intuitiveness and thematic sensibility that are superficially similar to avid bowies like bowie jobriath is fascinated with extraterrestrial fantasies that combine autoeroticism and prophecy though jobriaths musical and poetic vernacular are blunter deliberately eschewing intellectual sophistication for a bold populist stance
4620921 presenting jobriath in the way he must be presented means you have to break all the rules that requires the greatest promoter in the world and im it
4620922 if youre planning to come to new york paris is the best place to come from
4620923 this is our first large format store to be built in hawaii since 1999 and we are confident that we will be able to bring the products and services that the residents in the area are looking for
4620924 we are also proud to be part of the environmentally responsible development represented by the dowling co
4620925 we are absorbing the costs the investment is at the expense of tesco not the farmers
4620926 the supermarkets are telling us they will pay for price cuts out of their own money but we have bitter experience of what happens in the medium to long term
4620927 if farmers cant recoup those increases they will end up not producing next year and if production falls then prices will rise further
4620928 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help
4620929 negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4620930 the fact that prices are going up at shop level does not mean the farmers are getting more
4620931 are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4620932 put forward serious arguments that need to be heard and struck a resounding chord with the public
4620933 he was actually talking at the time about how to support local food producers in scotland something he knows a lot about i suspect his explosion about farmers going to live in horrible cities wasnt like his denunciation of the modern uk city along the lines of his hideous carbuncle speech it was addressing how if you pursue further industrialisation of agriculture it inevitably means growers are displaced from the land and will end up in mega slums this isnt wild fantasy its describing what is happening
4620934 but farming is right at the top not least because hes a farmer he spends a lot of time on home farm in gloucestershire and takes an immense interest in contemporary farming this year he is patron of the year of food and farming and most small farmers would see him as a friend and advocate
4620935 the daily telegraph interview was given to highlight the north highland initiative thats one of the four or five initiatives he has set up to help farmers products become more competitive by using imaginative marketing solutions
4620936 no but i think he was overstating it if someone asked me what was the most serious issue affecting the environment at the moment id say climate change rather than biotechnology biotechnology is a very important issue there are lots of scientific and health issues connected with it that are still unanswered but the most important issue about biotechnology is that the vast majority of applications which have come out of research into gm have had nothing to solving the problems of poverty hunger and food security and everything to do with extending the control which agri business has over the food chain
4620937 if you do ask how to go about solving those issues biotechnology would be quite low down higher up would be solutions such as giving people more entitlement to the land land reform redirecting agricultural extension services to small farmers and looking at a wide range of sustainable farming techniques which dont rely on invasive high technology approaches but build on farmers existing knowledge
4620938 is that hes talking about corporate control and its effect on agriculture its not exactly leftwing but it is radical i would place him in that tradition of philanthropic experimental landowners like robert owen who does things in a patriarchal and paternalistic way but genuinely wants to leave the world a better place
4620939 but he doesnt strike me as being too concerned about poverty and poverty reduction
4620940 the point is that charles for all his current voice of the people role is someone whose life is wrapped in cotton wool where every whim is catered for and not challenged
4620941 i remember leaving balmoral one evening with the prince of wales in a convoy of four vehicles suddenly to be instructed to return immediately to the castle fearing a real emergency i asked why he told me that he had left an electric light on and not to turn it off would be a terrible waste of electricity so the whole convoy returned to extinguish the light i dont begrudge the prince of wales his reed and lily bed for the natural recycling of liquid waste its just that no one seems to notice how totally at odds it is with all the devotion to detail and excess which is the hallmark of his life at highgrove
4620942 prince charles is who he is and says what he says and thats fine
4620943 but i dont think he should stand as a spokesperson for the broader environmental and social justice system the trouble is we are trapped in a celebrity culture and royalty is part of that there are many voices out there possibly more suited to speak people who know more about the issues in greater depth and from the perspective of global justice but its a celebrity system and celebrities crowd out more informed voices
4620944 much needed investment in the uks oil and gas reserves
4620945 they concluded rationing was the only way to achieve dramatic cuts without feeding inflation or causing social unrest

4620955 entonces la globalizaci n neoliberal o sea la capitalista destruye lo que hay en esos pa ses destruye su cultura su idioma su sistema econ mico su sistema pol tico y tambi n destruye los modos en que se relacionan los que viven en ese pa s
4620956 algunas de las bases econ micas de nuestro m xico que eran el campo y la industria y el comercio nacionales est n bien destruidas y apenas quedan unos pocos escombros que seguro tambi n van a vender
4620957 y donde antes hab a cr ditos y precios de protecci n ahora solo hay limosnas y a veces ni eso
4620958 en su lado del trabajador de la ciudad pues las f bricas cierran y se quedan sin trabajo o se abren las que se llaman maquiladoras que son del extranjero y que pagan una miseria por muchas horas de trabajo
4620959 y tambi n dijeron que hay que abrir las fronteras para que entre todo el capital extranjero que as se van a apurar los empresarios mexicanos y a hacer mejor las cosas pero ahora vemos que ya ni hay empresas nacionales todo se lo comieron los extranjeros y lo que venden est peor que lo que se hac a en m xico
4620960 y es que la constituci n ya est toda manoseada y cambiada ya no es la que ten a los derechos y las libertades del pueblo trabajador sino que ahora est n los derechos y las libertades de los neoliberalistas para tener sus grandes ganancias
4620961 que reconozca los derechos y libertades del pueblo y defienda al d bil frente al poderoso
4620962 el pacto de chapultepec significa convertir al estado mexicano en un estado policiaco donde incluso el ej rcito el ej rcito federal mexicano va a asumir las condiciones de una polic a interna se acab la soberan a nacional si ganan ellos los ej rcitos ya no van a servir para defender al pa s en caso de una invasi n externa van a servir para defender a los ricos de la gente pobre

4620966 happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it really is
4620967 all state licensing authorities within the united states recognize chiropractic as a primary health care profession distinct from medicine in 1998 the journal of the american medical association reported that 42 1 percent of the u s population had sought some form of non traditional medical care most commonly chiropractic those visits surpassed the number of visits to traditional medical physicians
4620968 as of the fall term 2005 there are more than 10 000 students in chiropractic colleges in the united states
4620969 in addition chiropractic students must pass exams produced by an independent licensing agency prior to receiving a license to practice the nbce produces examinations used to satisfy certification and licensure requirements in all 50 states students of chiropractic must pass practical exams that demonstrate their readiness to practice the nbce part iv practical exam is required or accepted by 47 states
4620970 the nbce board of directors also points out the harmful effects that passage of the bill could have on the economy if passed s 1955 would cause a decline in numbers of patients seeking chiropractic those patients would then be forced to increase their usage of pharmaceuticals to alleviate symptoms that chiropractors could have eliminated without drugs the loss in business caused by s 1955 could create vast numbers of chiropractors unable to repay their student loans
4620971 what happens if you reach your limit and you cant pay the bill
4620972 robbing peter to supply paul is how we like to describe it most 100 green tariffs are a con because they tell you youll reduce your carbon footprint etc but dont tell you someone elses will go up as a direct result nothing really changes its just a redistribution of existing green sources
4620973 we will spend around 1bn on new renewable projects in the next two years including europes biggest windfarm whitelee near glasgow our renewable portfolio will be 10 of our capacity by 2010
4620974 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4620975 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4620976 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4620977 we regret any inconvenience that this unplanned situation may cause our customers
4620978 we are working hard to minimize the impact of this situation and have established a dedicated team of employees to focus on this top priority
4620979 based on our assessment of what the beltline wants to do there is no equitability in the allocation of those dollars when youre going to use 80 percent of it in the northeast quadrant
4620980 im hopeful that between now and the time the closing happens the masons will decide they wont need to have all their money in 2008
4620981 when you look at everything from the olympics to grady hospital people make decisions all the time that help the greater good of the city and the region
4620982 in march and april abi repeatedly requested to restructure or defer northeast corridor loan payments and the masons declined to do that unless abi put up a 45 million line of credit
4620983 the joint venture has honored all their obligations to date and we expect them to do so
4620984 we did not have the opportunity to make recommendations in that regard
4620985 we found out about it after the fact and thats not the way thats supposed to happen if we are going to be advisers then call upon us give us the opportunity to advise you
4620986 wed be looking at two to three years of litigation that every attorney weve consulted has said wed lose
4620987 die geringf gige besch ftigung ist im gastgewerbe seit 2003 von 537 000 auf 675 000 gestiegen
4620988 you have too many emotions and you dont fuck me enough
4620989 ride me u like louie u like caswell u like this enjoi hammer me use me
4620990 the size of the price increase is the real surprise
4620991 we continue to think the disappointments are a product of under investment
4620992 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4620993 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated
4620994 therefore we continue to expect that earnings per share diluted from operations in 2009 will increase however at a rate below our long term objective of 6 percent to 8 percent growth
4620995 oils losses this week are the steepest in dollar terms since futures began trading in new york in 1983 and the steepest in percentage terms since december 2004
4620996 en france tous les trois jours une femme meurt victime de violences conjugales
4620997 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4620998 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4620999 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
4621000 my advice to the obama people proceed with extreme caution they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss
4621001 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4621002 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4621003 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
4621004 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
4621005 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf are they inspired by the falling
4621006 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory
4621007 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
4621008 the fact that an islander has been 16 years in australia and has a good character would not justify the minister in granting a certificate unless there were some very special circumstances
4621009 as a father to his children he will always be the ultimate role model
4621010 despite hundreds of millions of pounds spent each year on uk drug enforcement activity there is remarkably little evidence of its effectiveness in disrupting markets and reducing availability
4621011 you cant fail to notice that russian leaders are ignoring the opportunity to convey their point of view to the world
4621012 saakashvili is really never off american tv screens i suspect that if russian president medvedev decided to talk to foreign journalists they would of course respond
4621013 there are agencies that work for russia but i dont know how they can be comfortable about that
4621014 follow the official propaganda line on the north korean nuclear issue be objective when it comes to the middle east issue and play it down as much as possible no fuss about the darfur question no fuss about un reform be careful with cuba if any emergency occurs please report to the foreign ministry
4621015 in case of an emergency involving foreign tourists please follow the official line if theres no official line stay away from it
4621016 all food safety issues such as cancer causing mineral water
4621017 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing
4621018 and dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4621019 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4621020 and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning it means we havent lost an officer overnight
4621021 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight
4621022 the bnps attempts to present a respectable image are still masking some deeply disturbing underlying views
4621023 there is a gypsy problem there whats wrong with people who talk frankly about their problems
4621024 when they found that head there was a big deal in town
4621025 there are many people who know a lot but they do not want to talk because they dont like it
4621026 when he met the ladies he kissed their hands he would open doors for them american guys dont do that
4621027 i was surprised how many smart people in san marino looked up to him
4621028 there was something wrong with the guy he was a flaky guy his story shifted and changed
4621029 was that he said he was working in film and television but when i asked how many tv sets he had he said i dont own a tv i dont like it
4621030 but how can you be that plausible a con artist is a con artist
4621031 he lived in a separate house in the back and dealt mostly with the mother his landlord
4621032 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4621033 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
4621034 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
4621035 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
4621036 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
4621037 there are a few countries that will say told you so
4621038 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
4621039 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
4621040 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
4621041 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
4621042 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4621043 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4621044 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
4621045 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
4621046 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
4621047 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
4621048 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
4621049 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
4621050 this may not be a culmination but only step one
4621051 if you dont stop this kind of behaviour it escalates
4621052 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
4621053 no offence was intended by the advert but whether the chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for spanish sport
4621054 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4621055 members of the madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the guardians accusation exists a plan by certain people in the anglo saxon world to dirty spains name over their bid for the games
4621056 it seems that no one read the original i didnt accuse anyone of anything
4621057 in bad faith by some members of the press so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action
4621058 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4621059 i would like to say that we have a huge respect for the orient and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china and one of our spanish national team sponsors is the chinese brand li ning
4621060 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4621061 but we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever so as far as we are concerned the matter rests
4621062 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the us there would be suspensions
4621063 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4621064 was forced to adapt to a fast moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained lessons were learned the hard way
4621065 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff
4621066 facing a task for which it was not originally designed
4621067 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4621068 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4621069 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4621070 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4621071 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4621072 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4621073 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4621074 they say there are 10 shots in a headfucker but theres only vodka gin bacardi orange juice and grenadine
4621075 weve seen some trouble but were here for a laugh the drink is watered down but i drink as much as i can sensibly
4621076 theyre kids here and what they want to do here is normal for kids its just 3 000 people enjoying themselves at night it would be much worse if we had 3 000 greek people getting drunk here they would kill each other
4621077 if you buy one drink and get five free i dont think you can expect to get the good stuff and if you drink a lot of cheap alcohol you do stupid things
4621078 the biggest problem is people on quadbikes who have never ridden them before they kill themselves
4621079 i take my wife and sons to eat outside malia in the summertime none of my sons uses their bikes i take them in the car because of the quadbikes
4621080 lots of the tourists do not respect that we live here its like a carnival they dress up like clowns and go around like jerks and spoil the picture of this place for the whole of greece and europe
4621081 thats how it should be in england its much safer here
4621082 people think its going to be all sex but its not
4621083 if you go looking for a fight you can find one anywhere i think southends worse
4621084 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark
4621085 this week well be meeting tabitha shes a successful television presenter with her own production company but she doesnt know which lap dancing club her coke addled boyfriend is currently favouring and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more she recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home spiritually cleansed owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasnt worn the wrong thing since her second form end of term disco nonetheless she wouldnt be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without googling and cant find her own 40 000 wet room without her pa relaying directions via her blackberry tonight were going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu ometer then after weve talked her down from the ledge well have our regular consultant deirdre on hand to give tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection wont be conditional upon her haircut
4621086 especially since we still are in two schools and we need to make sure theres no problems there
4621087 it actually did we hadnt really thought of doing that and thats when we started changing our procedures
4621088 its the same as my first album thug motivation 101 jeezy told xxlmag
4621089 when money was plentiful i was the first one who told you to stack it live your life with it now that money slowed up ima be the one telling you to save it like they aint gon make it no more
4621090 i wouldnt say that i was capitalizing off of it
4621091 you wanna know who is capitalizing off of it you gotta go talk to bush hes at the basketball games over in china gas is like 9 almost it seems like but hes enjoying himself while the rest of us are suffering
4621092 i got family members aunts uncles and friends that still live their life
4621093 you going through trials and trills but you cant save everybody so it definitely affects me when i get the phone calls and somebodys getting put out of their house somebody doesnt have a ride to work somebody cant pay their bills and there aint really a lot of opportunity out there for you
4621094 bringing human rights home with the gulf coast civic works act
4621095 i left because i feared for my life i came back because i want to continue my work and to keep the public interest law center running i have to work and to be on ground in order to give people some kind of hope i dont want to be illegal somewhere or to seek asylum i know it is not safe and it wont be safe as long as there is no global dialogue with all actors but i am more useful here than outside i am in gods hand i also hope that the raining season will be a relatively calm period
4621096 pennies a bucket do not end slavery for florida farmworkers
4621097 ingrid is a symbol of resistance and the fact that she is now free is very important her freedom makes us believe that much is possible
4621098 cole was said before the draft to be immature that he blew off a conference call the day of the draft to go golfing seemed like further evidence of that
4621099 throws 98 miles an hour with a hard slider and changeup
4621100 i guess you dont rush austin jackson at this point
4621101 i dont like the tone of abrahams piece at all

4621106 but you wouldnt be selling drugs here by any chance
4621107 i am an officer of the law and if your stupid enough to pull a weapon out on me in broad daylight i can only assume your stupid enough to resist arrest
4621108 oh im fine dont worry about me i just need to find out whats going on
4621109 shes alright the woman you hit but she isnt very happy about her car
4621110 well i suppose ill have to deal with that later right now i guess i should check out and speak with my boss by the way i was on my way to deliver a package to you funny isnt it
4621111 anyway i just came up to see if you were alright i was the one that called 911 after i saw the accident didnt know it was you until the ambulance arrived
4621112 my head feels like it split in half or something
4621113 yeah sure just as soon as my boss chews me out
4621114 your in some serious trouble you know that right mikey
4621115 well just that the woman you hit apparently came in here and had this big fight with the boss shell probably try to sue the company or something
4621116 oh come on she isnt going to sue the company i was just trying to avoid hitting some kid in the road i mean im the one that ended up in the hospital
4621117 its new york mike everyone in this city sues everyone else in this city i even read a story about a kid suing his parents for spanking him to hard or some other crap like that
4621118 okay maybe your right but im sure the boss will understand if i just explain it to him okay i mean i really didnt do anything wrong
4621119 ah that thing looks gross jeez you sure you shouldve left the hospital
4621120 oh good youve saved me the trouble of calling you here
4621121 terasnya adalah pemimpin islam dan tidak semestinya pas yang menjadi teras dia ikut keadaan semasa
4621122 saya tidak menerima andaian berkenaan kita pas membuat kerjasama dengan pakatan rakyat berbeza dengan umno dalam barisan nasional bn
4621123 kita hanya membuat persefahaman pilihanraya yang longgar pakatan tidak sama dengan barisan
4621124 di perak kita menang enam kerusi dun dewan undangan negeri tetapi kita menjadi mb menteri besar
4621125 kita beri pandangan supaya mengekalkan pegawai kerajaan kerana pengalaman kita di kelantan dan terengganu apabila dilantik orang politik banyak masalah
4621126 keputusan ini adalah perbincangan di peringkat pakatan rakyat bukan di dalam media
4621127 kerana ketika ini pakatan rakyat tidak ada ketua maka anwar yang paling layak

4621132 offshore drilling whose issue is it anyway the peoples or the politicians
4621133 theyre competing for an ever decreasing share of the household income expenditures
4621134 they do not have ultimate flexibility with regard to changing whatever it is that theyre doing
4621135 they can watch their cost side as much as they can keep their costs down so they can maintain their margins but the best medicine for the small business in central wisconsin would be for the overall economy to improve unfortunately they dont have a whole lot of control over that sort of thing

4621149 in case of an emergency involving foreign tourists please follow the official line if theres no official line stay away from it
4621150 all food safety issues such as cancer causing mineral water
4621151 stand outside yourself and ask yourself if you like what you see if the answer is yes then thats all that matters
4621152 give me your three greens for my two reds because for five years you made me wear school uniform to a primary school that didnt have one
4621153 we are now working at the limits of human ability unless we discover how to breed people with pointy heads and fins or outboard motors this is the only way anything of interest is going to happen in the sport ever again
4621154 i know god would give us a chance to win so when it happened we grabbed it

4621447 oh the smurf watches you not fair since she can hide under the pallets
4621448 i rolled my window down shot a rubber band at the girl in the car next to me and drove off was that mean of me
4621449 she kept bending over and she has those pants that show her buttcrack
4621450 yeah i had to help her take her shirt off a few minutes ago
4621451 so i had this bloody nose and thought i could use a tampon to soak it up
4621452 the bottle in your hand is not that kind of lotion what youre looking for is in the pharmacy
4621453 it was i love to bend over and get smacked that got my curiosity
4621454 your mom gave up on making jelly just because of one messup is that why youre an only child
4621455 yes the sticks with the red glowing ends those are the hot ones
4621456 of course you were the one who fell behind the washer you always have sex on the washer with your phone in hand
4621457 why did such an attack take so long to happen
4621458 several hundred miles from new delhi and islamabad india pakistan hostility is spilling over into another country afghanistan here the two countries are engaged in an unacknowledged bid for supremacy in their bilateral relationship with afghanistan for the moment india seems to be winning this new version of the great game effortlessly
4621459 pakistans inter services intelligence isi agency is a global curse the massive and callous july 7 blast outside the indian embassy in kabul has exposed pakistans hollowness and duplicity for orchestrating the nefarious act the government of india was well aware about isis deceitful maneuverings some months ago no less a person than afghanistan president hamid karzai had cautioned india about what was going to befall and mar indian interests in afghanistan his assessment has proved correct pakistan has exhibited its classic example of hate india relationship with gusto and this time in a foreign country
4621460 it is nothing further than upsetting pakistan why should they india have consulates in jalalabad and khandahar what is their interest there is no interest other than disturbing pakistan doing something about pakistan
4621461 to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder in the international system commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power
4621462 trilateral consensus between kabul delhi and washington on islamabad alone being the primary and near exclusive troublemaker in afghanistan
4621463 kabul replacing kashmir as the main area of antagonism and as the main area of indo pak antagonism
4621464 indias malicious intentions against pakistan and its efforts that aim to sabotage pakistan afghanistan relations
4621465 are engaged in undermining pakistans security from two fronts they are busy using the baluch card and the pashtun militant card
4621466 india is an eternal enemy of the ummah islamic community and would be confronted after defeating the allied forces stationed in afghanistan
4621467 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4621468 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4621469 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4621470 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4621471 one year later but still not too late for you
4621472 the present international monetary financial system will die and will never recover this system is finished
4621473 the only possibility that exists now is to create a replacement system based on the principles of the founding of the u s economic system with the founding of the actual constitutional government as defined under particularly alexander hamilton
4621474 theres no future for the united states and no future for the world
4621475 the united states must propose to the governments of russia china and india that these four major countries will agree to sponsor a committee an alliance of powers including other powers to establish a fixed exchange rate financial credit system internationally of the type that roosevelt intended in 1944 not what truman did in 1945
4621476 kabhi kabhi because its catchy and easy to remember who like a r rahman because his tunes are different from the rest who like metallica because they are heavy who like harry belafonte because he is funny who like nirvana because kurt cobain was a true rockster who like roger waters because he goes well with dope and who like joe satriani because his fingering is very fast and bhimsen joshi because he can hold his breath for long
4621477 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark

4621484 the speed is slower there is an imitation of phonological features he raises his voice at the end of sentences to check hes understood hes giving equal stress to each word this is classical trying to make yourself understood to a foreigner english its typical of the way english people compensate for the lack of foreign language ability

4621507 the result was a dynamic multi sensory and cutting edge event
4621508 mccain and obama would come to iraq to campaign in fallujah and samarra basra and erbil
4621509 they concluded rationing was the only way to achieve dramatic cuts without feeding inflation or causing social unrest

4621515 it is appalling that new zealand has jailed christian converts like thomas yadegary for long periods when their only crime has been not to sign papers which would see them returned to persecution in iran
4621516 the court of appeal judges were right that to extend the 29 month imprisonment was unreasonable in the circumstances thus justifying mr yadegarys release on bail
4621517 unfortunately the immigration bill currently before parliament has clauses which tie the hands of the judges in future bail applications

4621525 no mr president atlantas not burning were talking about the country of georgia no really its a state and a country ask condi shell tell you
4621526 john mccain touts his experience on the campaign trail but in reality that so called experience is the experience of being up to your neck in lobbyists with shifting loyalties who take money from foreign governments to spend it on american politicians john mccains key foreign policy advisor has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the nation of georgia to lobby for them do we really need this kind of washington insider experience or do we want someone who doesnt surround himself with people beholden to foreign influences ive personally lost count of how many top campaign advisors have had to quit the mccain campaign because their lobbying past has come to light but i can tell you how many advisors obama has had to fire for being foreign lobbyists zero thats change you can believe in
4621527 i call on john mccain to stand up for veterans rights and denounce the veterans administration for restricting voter registration access to disabled veterans john mccain of all people should know that there is no one in america who more deserves the right to vote than the brave veterans across this country who put their lives on the line to protect this right for the federal government to restrict their access to register to vote is disgusting and i am waiting to hear john mccain say this in public
4621528 maybe people in the military have noticed that john mccain just isnt there for them the way that barack obama is maybe theyve noticed that mccain couldnt be bother to vote for the new gi bill and in fact actively opposed it as being too generous to them maybe thats why theyve given barack obama six times what theyve given john mccain people in the military are not fools they look at what the candidates say and what the candidates do barack obama has stood up for them against john mccain and it looks like they have shown their appreciation
4621529 im looking forward to meghan mccains childrens book about her father john ill be especially interested in whether it teaches them to count up to the keating five or whether meghan decided that childrens tender minds needed to be protected from that piece of john mccains personal history in washington its also interesting to note that a book for children fails to mention mccains children from his own first marriage
4621530 maybe john mccains campaign needs a quick refresher course in mathematics
4621531 i cannot tell you how much it satisfies me you look at it and feel you are the best in the world

4621534 these letters often over simplify the outcomes of inspections and in doing so misrepresent the findings
4621535 the letters in effect give licence to pupils to question the professionalism of the school and its staff
4621536 where schools involve their pupils in sharing the key messages of the letter sensitively and openly they are a valuable tool in engaging pupils in both the inspection and subsequent school improvement

4621541 australia has one of the safest aviation systems in the world
4621542 we know we dont have a systemic problem with maintenance and safety but some of the stuff were seeing published is pretty crazy
4621543 the cost pressures in every legacy carrier are just as intense as in qantas
4621544 all well established carriers have therefore increased the risk levels associated with maintenance throughout the world over the last decade
4621545 given that qantas had a leading position 10 years as the worlds safest then in all honesty it is probably still there
4621546 whats playing out is the tension of outsourcing everything and the timely and quality maintenance that was traditionally done by airlines
4621547 it just means that someone didnt lock it down properly before take off
4621548 legally qantas did not have to replace it and they could have flown on without a problem
4621549 a lot of these things are found when planes are on the ground and thats what the inspections are there for

4621560 well you know if you cancel your tv service the cost of your internet service with increase by 12 and youll lose some speed on the connection
4621561 weve got streets in terrible disrepair our garbage trucks are nearly worn out we dont have a police department thats functional and we dont have any money to put these things back in shape so i think its time for us to throw our hands up and quit

4621568 the system is not set in stone im open to reform long term there are a number of things were looking at the making good progress pilot is one of those but it would be wrong to rush into a change straight away
4621569 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009

4621573 what we didnt know was whether the french could improve again you can never expect to win each one of us looked at our contribution and at how we could improve it but this isnt just about the three of us its about the whole squad our support staff are the best in the world and there were four riders left out of the team one of them here and three back home who are all world class athletes
4621574 they needed a stronger voice and someone said why not stand
4621575 i thought councillors were not quite members of the human race
4621576 with a very strong ethic for helping others deeply committed to their jobs i dont like people being rude about local government particularly our social services staff who do a fantastic job
4621577 if you really want to change lives the biggest change you can make is to allow them to be independent
4621578 if you dont have that youre fundamentally trapped its the great slavery of the day isnt it
4621579 in their hearts labour believes in the state and it is deeply ingrained
4621580 for conservatives and certainly for myself the opposite is true our ultimate belief is about freedom independence individualism the characteristics that made this country great
4621581 old style patrician tory with a very strong social conscience and a great sense of humour
4621582 aside from the duke of wellington it was the unlikely pairing of nelson mandela and madonna
4621583 sandy had a strong social conscience a zest for life courage determination and a passionate commitment to public service
4621584 but it wasnt just the rich and grand places he loved he also treasured the hidden heritage of ordinary people in the rural farmhouses and the urban terraces in the seaside at margate and in the suburbs of maidstone and chatham
4621585 the olympic games is not a race which i ever want to watch on television and think what could i have done in there
4621586 you get in there and give it your best shot
4621587 obviously i could have done with more time and when your biggest week of actual running is two weeks before the race it is not an ideal preparation
4621588 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up what is the worst that can happen and are you ok to live with that but it is a calculated risk
4621589 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort despite being urged not to
4621590 every day shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4621591 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4621592 it is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4621593 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4621594 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4621595 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4621596 opera is not high on the agenda of many young men so we thought it might be interesting to see what would happen if we met them on a beach and whether they could make the art form relevant to their lives
4621597 their jaws dropped and their eyes opened wide when the singers performed a few feet from them
4621598 its a great project the singers are amazing i was blown away
4621599 the point is that she doesnt give up she keeps going
4621600 i think getting them out of inland communities and to the beach has opened up a lot of reflectiveness being close to the sea can do that
4621601 i think its been life changing for some of them theyve had their eyes opened to many possibilities
4621602 i wish i could turn the clock back no other lender would entertain us we had a bad credit history and the lender knew this but offered us an enormous amount of money which was too good to refuse
4621603 having to leave felt so helpless im letting my family down and feel totally inadequate
4621604 this is going to scar my children for life i fought it for so long and did everything i could but the authorities wouldnt do anything
4621605 it is better to have a leader who is good at pr
4621606 image is important but it shouldnt distract us from the big arguments
4621607 cameron provides the pr it is his unreformed and grumpy team that are setting the same old tory policy agenda
4621608 the bnps attempts to present a respectable image are still masking some deeply disturbing underlying views
4621609 there is a gypsy problem there whats wrong with people who talk frankly about their problems
4621610 unfortunately this city commission does not understand the consequences of working against tbc texas border coalition valley interfaith nature preserves and everyone eleses efforts to stop the border wall construction all of the border cities throughout are united with tbc and are fighting on brownsvilles behalf but our commissioners unwillingness to stand united against the federal government undermines all who oppose the wall

4621621 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4621622 we have to move away from this property tax not increase our reliance on it but no homeowner no property owner should have an increase in their annual property tax bill greater than 4 percent

4621628 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in you lives
4621629 perhaps their gift will be saving the life of a future firefighter or helicopter pilot
4621630 i know everyone says it but it truly is an honor to be mentioned with the other nominees
4621631 the other nominees are not only friends but also people i highly respect in the music industry im just honored to be placed among such a great group of people
4621632 i thought it was safe place but its not nothing is safe these days
4621633 i dont know why they do this they do this on purpose
4621634 now we have to work harder instead of making some money we have to work hard to make the money to buy those parts
4621635 we dont recognize the city of chicago or its police as a legitimate

4621644 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up the uk is fast becoming the obesity capital of the world and the effect of spiralling obesity amongst children is particularly worrying
4621645 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services
4621646 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4621647 much needed investment in the uks oil and gas reserves
4621648 the french are so preoccupied with etiquette they never learn manners
4621649 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
4621650 no offence was intended by the advert but whether the chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for spanish sport
4621651 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4621652 members of the madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the guardians accusation exists a plan by certain people in the anglo saxon world to dirty spains name over their bid for the games
4621653 it seems that no one read the original i didnt accuse anyone of anything
4621654 in bad faith by some members of the press so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action
4621655 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4621656 i would like to say that we have a huge respect for the orient and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china and one of our spanish national team sponsors is the chinese brand li ning
4621657 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4621658 but we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever so as far as we are concerned the matter rests
4621659 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the us there would be suspensions
4621660 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4621661 brilliant attempt but just outside medal position hopes for gold tragically dashed things just didnt go right for the british team there luck as important as skill in this event

4621694 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4621695 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4621696 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4621697 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4621698 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4621699 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4621710 a seismic shift in holiday bookings as spain has been the uks number one choice since the package holiday began
4621711 the brits are taking another look at holidaying at home because of the economic climate
4621712 2006 was a really hot summer that re engaged british holidaymakers with holidaying in britain as opposed to going abroad the trend has continued despite the rather poor summer weve had this year
4621713 people take three or four holidays a year and at least one in the uk has become a fixture
4621714 its more expensive to rent a cottage in devon in august than to get a self catering apartment in turkey
4621715 the credit crunch has affected our customers priorities in terms of booking a summer break as they now demand greater value than ever before customers are either staying in the uk with one of our major clients seeing bookings up 55 year on year or are going to non euro destinations where the pound is strong
4621716 with all these europeans coming over and britons staying at home its getting pretty busy on the beaches

4621726 john mccain touts his experience on the campaign trail but in reality that so called experience is the experience of being up to your neck in lobbyists with shifting loyalties who take money from foreign governments to spend it on american politicians john mccains key foreign policy advisor has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the nation of georgia to lobby for them do we really need this kind of washington insider experience or do we want someone who doesnt surround himself with people beholden to foreign influences ive personally lost count of how many top campaign advisors have had to quit the mccain campaign because their lobbying past has come to light but i can tell you how many advisors obama has had to fire for being foreign lobbyists zero thats change you can believe in
4621727 jerome corsis book isnt corsi the same guy who believes that oil is magically created and is a renewable resource isnt this the same guy who believes the united states is planning on merging with canada and mexico the only real question about anything corsi writes is how big a tinfoil hat he had on while writing it or perhaps his views on bigfoot
4621728 i call on john mccain to stand up for veterans rights and denounce the veterans administration for restricting voter registration access to disabled veterans john mccain of all people should know that there is no one in america who more deserves the right to vote than the brave veterans across this country who put their lives on the line to protect this right for the federal government to restrict their access to register to vote is disgusting and i am waiting to hear john mccain say this in public
4621729 maybe people in the military have noticed that john mccain just isnt there for them the way that barack obama is maybe theyve noticed that mccain couldnt be bother to vote for the new gi bill and in fact actively opposed it as being too generous to them maybe thats why theyve given barack obama six times what theyve given john mccain people in the military are not fools they look at what the candidates say and what the candidates do barack obama has stood up for them against john mccain and it looks like they have shown their appreciation
4621730 im looking forward to meghan mccains childrens book about her father john ill be especially interested in whether it teaches them to count up to the keating five or whether meghan decided that childrens tender minds needed to be protected from that piece of john mccains personal history in washington its also interesting to note that a book for children fails to mention mccains children from his own first marriage
4621731 maybe john mccains campaign needs a quick refresher course in mathematics when barack obama accurately pointed out in an ad that mccain votes with bush 95 of the time mccains campaign tried to say obama was the one voting in quote lockstep unquote with the president because obama had voted less than half the time with bush im not making this up you cant make stuff like this up ok quick question how many think almost half is more than ninety five percent which is voting in lockstep less than half or 95 maybe they just cant do simple math at mccain headquarters i dont know

4621740 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field

4621745 she has delved into hinduism in the past but i fear hers was a hurried glimpse into the vast sea of knowledge hinduism offers
4621746 hinduism consists of a rich and long tradition of philosophical thought dating back to about 3 000 bc which requires a wholehearted study and devotion
4621747 while wishing her all the best on her 50th birthday we would encourage madonna to undertake a serious study of hinduism its scriptures its schools of philosophy doctrines and practices
4621748 the russian tea room has played host to many famous faces throughout its 81 years we salute madonna on her 50th birthday and hope our former coat checker will come back and let us hang up her coat this time
4621749 madonna is not just an extraordinary woman to us she used to be part of the russian tea room family
4621750 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution

4621780 erick aybar has been doing a great job in the two hole and with the experience he is understanding counts better
4621781 hes always had the ability to hit up in the lineup and hell get a shot there
4621782 its going to obviously put some more weight on other players that have to carry the load
4621783 were going to have to move on but its a certain part of what weve done to this point
4621784 hes swinging the bat well and can give us some versatility
4621785 hes a good bat off the bench so well give him a look right now

4621790 despite repeated warnings the government dogmatically ploughed on and outsourced this important and sensitive work to the private sector

4621795 it makes a big impression on the communities all round
4621796 they have not seen any project like it the children are really happy now their school is the equal to others
4621797 the same holds true for all the physical senses what you see hear taste touch and smell are all ultimately patterns of neuronal stimulation that in some way correlates with what is out there but still are not really that

4621800 peron said that by now hopefully madonna has realised that her daughter lourdes is a reincarnated evita peron
4621801 it seems that madonna spent so much time at evitas grave doing research for her film role as evita that evita herself took over madonnas body during filming
4621802 those among us who are sensitive to this kind of thing can actually see eva peron going into madonnas body when she sings dont cry for me argentina in the balcony scene evita chose madonna as a mother figure and became lourdes
4621803 madonna fell pregnant with lourdes while she was making the film
4621804 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
4621805 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
4621806 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
4621807 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
4621808 i can remember a time last year when i lifted my net and the wind caught it i just about went surfing
4621809 there was about the same number of whitebaiters then as there are today but there was so much whitebait my old man used to feed some to the chooks and dig the rest into the ground as fertiliser
4621810 wed sell some to the fish and chip shop and get sixpence a pound about five cents but thats not pocket money
4621811 but i dont worry ive got the caravan all set up and some pork stew in the crockpot
4621812 there have been times when i have had the three in front of me get nothing and ive gone off with five pounds then there are times when it has been me whos got nothing
4621813 why do i come down here its the serenity you sit on the beach and its peaceful with no one to bitch at you hey youd better not say that in case the wife thinks i am talking about her
4621814 i look forward to opening day and start getting ready three months before i count the weeks and the days after july even on a shit day like this its still peaceful
4621815 youve always got to have a frypan in the back
4621816 once there was a couple of flounders and my wife got a kahawai in her net they chase the bait in those flounders were just luck ah but its good luck with whitebaiting you try to observe tradition and throw the first one back to appease the gods but theres nothing to say you cant throw it in front of the net theres a damn good chance you might catch it again
4621817 there are 1058 whitebait to a pound so youre not going to be able to check them all there are some that have a bit of a reddish tint i think they are one of the threatened species
4621818 we are probably going to have to pull back on some of the work we had planned
4621819 the problem there is that recycling is actually quite expensive we have been able to look at other areas to cover it and working on doing it more efficiently
4621820 will you be able to upload your face in the game
4621821 great deals in distressed properties the first rule is that nothings as simple as it sounds regarding a recent customer letter about sheriff sales i thought id post my reply free bank advertising and government property advertising
4621822 i didnt want to come out and having booing and people throwing eggs at me
4621823 when i went in the house peoples first opinion was what everybody would think that i love myself or i dont speak to people and im not like that at all
4621824 being eight weeks away from my daughter like that was hell on earth
4621825 i see her every day of my life by the time it got to week two i was waking up every day and thinking i cant justify being here any more
4621826 i was thinking if i hadnt been up for nomination then i might have walked but i wanted to finish it off and see if the crowd booed me otherwise it would have been a wasted experience
4621827 the returns his sponsors are getting are amazing at this particular point
4621828 its not easy when every single thing that is happening at the games is framed yes eclipsed by phelps mania
4621829 within a few weeks well have the nfl and college football and the homestretch of baseball
4621830 olympic athletes by and large have very short cycles in which they can generate revenues as sponsors
4621831 theres a longevity to phelps that typically you dont find in olympic athletes
4621832 he needs to buff out his personality and really demonstrate his charisma
4621833 was forced to adapt to a fast moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained lessons were learned the hard way
4621834 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff
4621835 facing a task for which it was not originally designed
4621836 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4621837 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4621838 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4621839 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4621840 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4621841 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4621842 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4621843 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing
4621844 and dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4621845 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4621846 and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning it means we havent lost an officer overnight
4621847 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight
4621848 they say there are 10 shots in a headfucker but theres only vodka gin bacardi orange juice and grenadine
4621849 weve seen some trouble but were here for a laugh the drink is watered down but i drink as much as i can sensibly
4621850 theyre kids here and what they want to do here is normal for kids its just 3 000 people enjoying themselves at night it would be much worse if we had 3 000 greek people getting drunk here they would kill each other
4621851 if you buy one drink and get five free i dont think you can expect to get the good stuff and if you drink a lot of cheap alcohol you do stupid things
4621852 the biggest problem is people on quadbikes who have never ridden them before they kill themselves
4621853 i take my wife and sons to eat outside malia in the summertime none of my sons uses their bikes i take them in the car because of the quadbikes
4621854 lots of the tourists do not respect that we live here its like a carnival they dress up like clowns and go around like jerks and spoil the picture of this place for the whole of greece and europe
4621855 thats how it should be in england its much safer here
4621856 people think its going to be all sex but its not
4621857 if you go looking for a fight you can find one anywhere i think southends worse
4621858 you showed no sign of any physical disability or of any discomfort
4621859 very tired and the pain makes me extremely nauseous and dizzy
4621860 he felt it improved his quality of life and to some extent improved his condition
4621861 it is derived from the old english cirm and meant the blended tinkling sounds produced by a small flock
4621862 oh no ill put it on the garden they grow lovely tomatoes
4621863 you should not have had a three year old girl sitting on the petrol tank with nowhere to put her feet
4621864 i was actually looking for flint i found a front tooth and another piece of bone and i looked to see where it had come from
4621865 police received reports of damage to the paintwork of a vehicle
4621866 it is a fun event but one we hope will bring more peoples attention to biodiesel
4621867 the biggest single problem we face is with attitudes weve still got cases at both police and cps level the outcome of which is decided when they first receive the complaint based on what they think the credibility of the witness is
4621868 they dont try to improve the credibility of the witness they make a decision at the outset that this is going nowhere and then the case is on a downward spiral
4621869 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
4621870 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
4621871 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
4621872 defence counsel will say youd had a few you were up for it
4621873 its something that strikes a chord with a jury everybody knows there are a lot of things you might do drunk that you wouldnt do if you were sober
4621874 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
4621875 while some forces are embracing change there are other individuals playing the life on mars stance where they allege that most cases are false allegations and not worth pursuing
4621876 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4621877 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4621878 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
4621879 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic i cant bring myself to shoot another person if people want to criticize me for that then im honored to be criticized because im not a killer
4621880 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the take action page for what you can do

4621883 and it raised the specter of more bloodshed as the pilgrimage route becomes crowded before the event saturday
4621884 despite the security precautions kerbala is bracing for the worst local health director alaa hammoudi said that 40 medical units were standing by and that extra hospital beds were made ready near the mosque makeshift clinics were set up in tents and trailers some pilgrims donated blood
4621885 i saw smoke and i smelled the very bad smell of burned flesh and blood the reactions were a little less than at the last blast maybe because they already have been shocked
4621886 women here still feel threatened one cant yet see a pervasive shift in the way women dress they continue to wear the conservative clothing that the militias began compelling them to wear after the u s invasion most women remain cocooned in shapeless black abaya dresses and hijab scarves that covered their hair before the war tammy says she could walk down the streets of her hometown the southern and heavily shia iraqi port city of basra dressed like most teenagers in the united states in jeans and no head scarf saddam husseins regime was one of the worlds most despotic but it was secular and allowed iraqi women personal rights and freedoms unparalleled in the persian gulf women who make up more than half of the countrys populartion could drive travel abroad alone serve in iraqi security forces and work side by side with men they chose whom to marry and whether to marry at all and were among the most educated in the region after the u s invasion in 2003 conservative muslim clerics called for iraq to become an islamic state in the name of islamic values they eroded the liberties women here enjoyed even under saddams oppressive regime schools once coed became segregated by gender women were afraid to go outside without a head scarf as sectarian violence engulfed baghdad and other parts of the country in 2006 it brought in its wake even more constraints on womens freedoms
4621887 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape
4621888 we are an organization trying to end the illegal war we are not endorsing any candidate we are endorsing the end of the iraq war if you are with us on that we could use some donations to continue this struggle

4621894 weve planted a seed for a new direction in paraguay
4621895 what weve undertaken is not an easy task but it will not be impossible
4621896 today ends the exclusive era in paraguay the era of corruption today begins the era when paraguay will be an implacable foe of the crooked
4621897 i dont want a country where some dont sleep because of fear or hunger
4621898 i want a paraguay where everyone benefits from the growth
4621899 i want the armed forces to be a friend of the people

4621905 one of the worst political books ever written corsi piles distortion upon innuendo to create a gigantic heap of right wing garbage with a seemingly endless parade of basic factual errors running through the text like rats corsis book is an embarrassment to the craft of journalism and any of the conservatives who have praised and promoted it should feel humiliated at how bad it truly is

4621915 being proud to be an american and being critical of it are not mutually exclusive actions
4621916 i agree that age should not be a deciding or disqualifying factor
4621917 its incredible to me that obama who grew up in hawaii and still has his 85 year old white grandmother living there would take this opportunity to politicize even his vacation by going to myrtle beach why he has no family or connections to that area is he ashamed of his white grandmother afraid it might put off some black voters by reminding them of his mixed racial heritage he should have visited her in hawaii i mean it is a us state after all

4621922 the action is surprising the community in blackburn is mainstream any act of terrorism not only does it give a bad name to islam and muslims it has an adverse reaction on race relations
4621923 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us
4621924 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4621925 they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4621926 they were quite a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4621927 what you see here at the moment is the communities moving forward and that is unstoppable we know paramilitaries are still trying to recruit some of those we are arresting are young people who would have no notion of what it was like in the troubles the glorious days of revolution that never existed stuff and people who are pretty unbalanced and dysfunctional but they are dangerous we know they are determined to attack and kill police and we have been lucky frankly
4621928 some poor victim would have a conversation with a police helmet
4621929 collusion the c word first we have to be clear there was without doubt collusion in some cases between security services and the paramilitaries was it endemic no it was not was it institutionalised no it was not that doesnt mean it didnt happen
4621930 leave with dignity at huge cost to my organisation in terms of experience was critical
4621931 it did give people an opportunity to move away if they didnt want to be part of a new world
4621932 generally speaking in britain senior leaders of the police service are pretty anonymous
4621933 here it is totally different and i misjudged that badly everything the police did was interpreted in a political way and in directly opposing ways by different sides
4621934 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with was that police business i would argue that it was the work we did in the states for the last six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4621935 once a year to tell him about policing and that its working its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4621936 i got flak last week for speaking to the representatives of loyalist paramilitaries the uda
4621937 wow he hates me with a vengeance i have a very basic benchmark i will talk to anyone who wants to make a contribution to policing
4621938 i fully understood that it would be deeply offensive at the time to talk to some of the people i spoke to but it was the right thing to do because it moved the world on
4621939 when i first met them i put an email out saying heres what im doing and heres why im doing it most cops with a lot of service said good luck if this means my kids dont have to go through what i went through im all for it
4621940 the point was an awful lot of people who are so called al qaida are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british the more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way theyre going
4621941 what we must have is a system in place pre event because all the lessons from knee jerk legislation from the dangerous dogs act onwards is that you get something unworkable chaotic and probably more draconian
4621942 my fear is that in the absence of proper legislation the temptation will be to charge people early to take risks and it will fall apart 10 20 years down the line
4621943 if that means on day 28 and one second someone who i suspect deeply of a huge outrage that i cannot charge them with will walk out the door society will have to judge government on that not me
4621944 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight thats the world we live in
4621945 it was tiresome and hurtful at the time but i have no difficulty with a journalist making observations about my personal life provided theyre accurate
4621946 when someone says something that goes to the heart of my integrity around money which is a downright lie i think you have no option but to sue when they refuse to retract it but youve got to live with what people write
4621947 it is a great privilege to run this organisation and i have no plans at all to move at the moment but one day
4621948 you cant fail to notice that russian leaders are ignoring the opportunity to convey their point of view to the world
4621949 saakashvili is really never off american tv screens i suspect that if russian president medvedev decided to talk to foreign journalists they would of course respond
4621950 there are agencies that work for russia but i dont know how they can be comfortable about that
4621951 are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4621952 put forward serious arguments that need to be heard and struck a resounding chord with the public
4621953 he was actually talking at the time about how to support local food producers in scotland something he knows a lot about i suspect his explosion about farmers going to live in horrible cities wasnt like his denunciation of the modern uk city along the lines of his hideous carbuncle speech it was addressing how if you pursue further industrialisation of agriculture it inevitably means growers are displaced from the land and will end up in mega slums this isnt wild fantasy its describing what is happening
4621954 but farming is right at the top not least because hes a farmer he spends a lot of time on home farm in gloucestershire and takes an immense interest in contemporary farming this year he is patron of the year of food and farming and most small farmers would see him as a friend and advocate
4621955 the daily telegraph interview was given to highlight the north highland initiative thats one of the four or five initiatives he has set up to help farmers products become more competitive by using imaginative marketing solutions
4621956 no but i think he was overstating it if someone asked me what was the most serious issue affecting the environment at the moment id say climate change rather than biotechnology biotechnology is a very important issue there are lots of scientific and health issues connected with it that are still unanswered but the most important issue about biotechnology is that the vast majority of applications which have come out of research into gm have had nothing to solving the problems of poverty hunger and food security and everything to do with extending the control which agri business has over the food chain
4621957 if you do ask how to go about solving those issues biotechnology would be quite low down higher up would be solutions such as giving people more entitlement to the land land reform redirecting agricultural extension services to small farmers and looking at a wide range of sustainable farming techniques which dont rely on invasive high technology approaches but build on farmers existing knowledge
4621958 is that hes talking about corporate control and its effect on agriculture its not exactly leftwing but it is radical i would place him in that tradition of philanthropic experimental landowners like robert owen who does things in a patriarchal and paternalistic way but genuinely wants to leave the world a better place
4621959 but he doesnt strike me as being too concerned about poverty and poverty reduction
4621960 the point is that charles for all his current voice of the people role is someone whose life is wrapped in cotton wool where every whim is catered for and not challenged
4621961 i remember leaving balmoral one evening with the prince of wales in a convoy of four vehicles suddenly to be instructed to return immediately to the castle fearing a real emergency i asked why he told me that he had left an electric light on and not to turn it off would be a terrible waste of electricity so the whole convoy returned to extinguish the light i dont begrudge the prince of wales his reed and lily bed for the natural recycling of liquid waste its just that no one seems to notice how totally at odds it is with all the devotion to detail and excess which is the hallmark of his life at highgrove
4621962 prince charles is who he is and says what he says and thats fine
4621963 but i dont think he should stand as a spokesperson for the broader environmental and social justice system the trouble is we are trapped in a celebrity culture and royalty is part of that there are many voices out there possibly more suited to speak people who know more about the issues in greater depth and from the perspective of global justice but its a celebrity system and celebrities crowd out more informed voices
4621964 were hitting a wall now and were so close to impeachment proceedings
4621965 its this commando thing of his his living here would be like a red rag to a bull he wants to be photographed playing golf and taking it easy
4621966 basically musharraf is being stubborn the two sides are playing brinkmanship
4621967 all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4621968 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out
4621969 im tempted to go with emil zatopek because i think it should be someone in athletics not a swimmer in keeping with the origins of the olympics but i dont have an answer for you
4621970 i think phelps is very very good but you cant judge these things just on the number of medals people in australia say ian thorpes our greatest olympian because hes won five medals but dawn fraser couldve won 10 gold medals
4621971 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4621972 we put people in business and we take people out of business
4621973 a revolving door for superintendents school officials indicted for bribery and theft unexplained budget deficits decaying building
4621974 were not usually ones to poke fun but the news that an irish atheist has managed to buy the domain name
4621975 in walt disney worlds tomorrowland my five year old sons favorite ride works for both of us hes the pilot and i record the mission
4621976 dont worry if you hate it its full of bugs its gt unbalanced or bland because this game has boobs
4621977 the ed sullivan show ed loved comics and stood about six feet to your right looking at you not the audience being hard of hearing and an optimist he assumed the audience was laughing and so invited the good ones and the clunkers back equally does that clear up that mystery one defensible reason to be a comedian in the words of my legendary now retired manager the incomparable jack rollins succeed at comedy and money will pour down on you like a golden waterfall and when it works and when as the great lynn fontanne of that unsurpassed pair of stage comedians lunt and fontanne phrased it on a show of mine on those nights when youre going high
4621978 el apoyo de yankee pues hicieron una buena promoci n y los actores son conocidos por los j venes
4621979 he is the most intellectually inconsistent politician in the history of politics
4621980 i have never seen anyone so completely without any commitment to any particular principle and so willing to say whatever he thinks will help him win the next election
4621981 we are coming to the end of a terrible stage the end of our struggle is near

4622012 when madonna was younger she became the example of if i can do it then you can do it now she has become the example of if you take care of yourself you can keep on going if something is not going well she gets rid of people she seems to know what she wants in life
4622013 its crazy to think that madonna is too old at 50 it is time for someone to be a role model for the over 50s
4622014 madonna is successful because shes doing what she wants not what people want her to do she has got an amazing talent for working with the right people she knows who to work with at the right time
4622015 i think discipline extreme focus and health are all important madonna has a very good mindset she does everything she can for herself whereas a lot of people seem to turn things against themselves she doesnt do drugs she goes training she has a family life and a spiritual life
4622016 since i was 16 people have been telling me i look like madonna i used to live in new york in the same district she lived in and people were always telling me i looked so like her
4622017 when i moved to the uk in 2001 people started telling me i should do a tribute act

4622024 i did a brilliant party in manchester a couple of weeks ago these people were not terribly wealthy but they had saved up to have me it was all for a woman who was 40 who was a massive madonna fan

4622135 in the manam valley we met the head man who said hed never seen white skinned people
4622136 it does make you feel youre doing something a bit different
4622137 theres much more reliance on your own judgment and therefore much more satisfaction
4622138 i look for really steep rock faces that havent been climbed before because theyre too hard
4622139 its an exercise in mental control i spend a huge amount of time planning every single scenario on the route in the moment of the climb im intently focused but relaxed at the same time

4622244 im quite pleased to be publishing forever green and thank michael vance for the opportunity to let people get a chance to see these rare treasures
4622245 the team of vance and green worked so well together in these strips im sure many will enjoy these collections of some of the most offbeat comic material ever seen
4622246 and no less so because he worked in alternative comics instead of the pro ones quality is quality wherever you find it
4622247 greater economic empowerment and increased investment in women it stands to reason that the quality of life within any family will improve
4622248 the biggest question and challenge for africa is finding options that are predictable where entry barriers for women into the market are removed
4622249 seven or eight of the mdgs are related to the development of women and if inequality between men and women continues these goals will not be met
4622250 its gay white males age 30 to 50 educated and wealthy
4622251 im tired of just doing plays for gay white men i want to bust some doors open
4622252 we dont have a big lesbian population in this theater and a lot of it has to do with our programming weve done some outreach but not enough
4622253 ive found that in certain ways the gay community is one of the most racist communities i cant even begin to tell you what ive experienced
4622254 i go out and i speak whats on my mind and sometimes i can be offensive
4622255 i want to learn the other side and create new work for actors
4622256 being a parent myself i want to see more childrens theater that really speaks to gay families
4622257 i mean why do gay audiences go to the taper its no different why wouldnt straight audiences come here
4622258 i was seating people in the theater and there were two middle aged guys in the back row
4622259 and they said what are all these straight people doing here
4622260 people might say thats the stupidest thing youve ever done and that youre going to destroy your theater that way maybe i will i have no idea but i do know that you cant be exclusive of anyone
4622261 i dont want people to think oh the celebration theatre they only do the gay plays there
4622262 i can tell you honestly that i have gone to see plays simply based on a poster with a good looking guy on it
4622263 sometimes you get pitched a play where its just seven guys naked on the stage the whole time and im like no there has to be substance behind it
4622264 this theater should be servicing the entire gay community not just one portion of the gay community
4622265 the gay white male demographic is not the one i want to keep hitting
4622266 its not like all of the black gays are over here and all of the gay latinos are over here

4622271 i wish i could write so much more that you couldnt keep up with it at all

4622276 but by the time i arrived she was against all that she was more interested in poulenc and particularly stravinsky in his neoclassic period so we were all doused in the symphony of psalms and all those things every wednesday we sang a bach cantata
4622277 i realized that id like to go back so thats how i got started in all this crazy stuff i had tried at the beginning but not been able to do
4622278 when they push it i tell em im 5 17
4622279 its kind of turned into this detrimental thing because everybody remembers my photos but they forgot i took em and its kinda weird

4622284 this is one of my favorite albums its got an exorcism on it i aint comin out its hilarious
4622285 im still stuck in that era in a lot of ways it influenced my politics
4622286 i came through the hippie era and all of that anti war stuff my father was a forest ranger which gave me an ecological consciousness and people like jello biafra from the dead kennedys helped crystallize it
4622287 it always kinda cracked me up there were a few punk rockers who went out there and were more anarchistic but really there was a lot more stuff going on in the hippie scene that they looked down on
4622288 there were just a lot of these little thrash bands spoutin all this stuff just loud and noisy copycat stuff
4622289 i used to carry my camera around for years it was always banging against my side but i just never saw anything i wanted to take a picture of anymore

4622361 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed

4622388 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4622389 the fact is that the iranian banks have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4622390 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks

4622415 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4622416 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body

4622419 um momento maravilhoso a equipe toda est confiante e motivada a gente nem pensa naquele jogo
4622420 they believed that this place was the entrance to xibalba that is why we have found the offerings there
4622421 it is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls
4622422 these sacred tunnels and caves were natural temples and annexes to temples on the surface
4622423 whether its from the wood industry turning it into fuel for your vehicle or electricity for your home through wind building wind turbines you have it this area is uniquely positioned to capture that
4622424 you need both electricians as well as manufacturing workers to be able to make these turbines and theres a huge demand for them out there but what michigan needs to do is adopt the renewable portfolio standard
4622425 i mean weve go to start focusing on that we do have a lot of resources here for that purpose
4622426 this will be used for the public to enjoy for recreation and scenic values
4622427 and well also be managing for fish and wildlife resources here
4622428 it doesnt have a future use for our company and we feel that it most appropriately belongs as part of the national forest system
4622429 this land is just a very iatrical piece of the sturgeon river wilderness
4622430 it really is the heart of the whole wilderness area and so it was very important to get that in public ownership to protect the values of the whole wilderness area
4622431 when im in the mood for someplace classy and or having some champagne this is the spot
4622432 for the past year ive been working on a volunteer project that has been an endless source of frustration
4622433 a brief history i first went to cafe la taza by myself during an eye doctor appointment across the street at dr
4622434 hey i dont have time to go home and hit my fabulous wine collection ill slide over to 24th street and hit the plumpjack store
4622435 although i live right around the corner ive only been to annies twice
4622436 trying to find a place to eat by driving around even though you have no idea to get anywhere because you do not live here
4622437 it would be to weird for us to go out
4622438 if the bank calls in their mortgage right now and the insurance isnt going to pay me ill lose everything
4622439 theres no doors theres no windows its just in shambles
4622440 its going to have to be torn down and rebuilt
4622441 ultimately it is up to the homeowner to insure that their buildings are safe
4622442 clearly this is an unusual circumstance so we want to work very closely with those owners help them through this process
4622443 i thought i would show his family how much i respect and appreciate the sacrifice
4622444 he lost his life for us so we wanted to be here to represent our community and say thank you on behalf of myself my kids and everybody
4622445 may he go with god his fellow firefighters will continue on his job and keep going as they do every single day
4622446 they deserve every bit of respect that theyre getting today
4622447 alright first of all yes just cuz she has boobs and a vagina she cant pass it
4622448 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo

4622451 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4622452 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4622453 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4622454 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4622455 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4622456 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4622457 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4622458 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4622459 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4622460 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4622461 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4622462 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4622463 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4622464 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4622465 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4622466 i had grease on my hands but i did this from my heart
4622467 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4622468 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4622469 oh dear g did you put your pennies in the sharks mouth
4622470 okay mama hes a bad shark i dont like him anymore
4622471 a variation of the fascist agenda applied to american culture
4622472 when i was very young most of my childhood heroes wore capes flew through the air or picked up buildings with one arm they were spectacular and got a lot of attention but as i grew my heroes changed so that now i can honestly say that anyone who does anything to help a child is a hero to me
4622473 ill love you forever ill like you for always as long as im living my baby youll be
4622474 beginnings are scary endings are usually sad but its the middle that counts the most try to remember that when you find yourself at a new beginning

4622493 and im going to deal with their personal life because character matters their personal life does matter as a leader god says so
4622494 i dont think either candidate will engender as much enthusiasm particularly among white evangelicals as george bush did
4622495 now that the republican party is a tarnished brand lots of people including evangelicals are looking for somewhere else to go
4622496 the democrats have to prove they would be a receptive and comfortable home for any evangelicals who want to move away from mccain and the republican party
4622497 i think initially the obama camp thought they would have a crack at a bigger slice of white evangelicals but in fact the latest numbers show a slightly worse position for obama than kerry had
4622498 i think the evangelical voter has been an important part of the republican constituency but its not a vote to be taken for granted
4622499 in the united states numbers impress us we gauge te success of an event by how many people attend or come forward we measure churches by how many members we boast we are wowed by big numbers jesus question the authenticity of this kind of record keeping according to the account in luke chapter 8 when a crowd started following him jesus began speaking in parables so that those who werent genuinely listenign wouldnt get it when crowds gather today speakers are extraconscious of communicating in a way that is accessible to everyone speakers dont use jesus tactic to eliminate people who are not sincere seekers the fact is he jesus wasnt interested in those who fake it

4622510 i think we started to go just for the climb then it became a family trip with the safari climb and orphanage and it all wrapped up into life experience

4622523 the epa is abandoning its mission by rushing a permit out the door for political expedience and ignoring the fact that it will emit massive quantities of co2 and other pollutants
4622524 its the same kind of tired arguments theyve made for over two years now

4622568 if jeff and i are going through a difficult time for whatever reason i dont feel alone i have at least two other women i can talk to who have been through difficult times but theyre still happily married i know im not alone in my struggles and that makes a world of difference and i have a few single friends who are supportive of my relationship and committed relationships in general even though theyre not in one now all that encouragement among my friends really helps whenever i start to worry that the challenges of a romantic relationship might be too much for me
4622569 all of our friends seem to be getting divorced or breaking up its depressing and makes me think theres something wrong with me for trying to make my relationship work when i try to talk to my friends about a fight i had with tad they just tell me to find someone better suited to you or relationships are overrated anyway the whole there are lots of fish in the sea mindset isnt helpful when im trying to make my relationship work now
4622570 all our friends are either divorcing or theyve become anti relationship

4622575 i think if you threw me into the dallas lineup in that series against detroit it definitely would have made a difference
4622576 i know ive had my battles with brenden in the past but the good thing about hockey players is the fact once you become teammates that stuff is all forgotten
4622577 itll be exciting to play on the same team maybe even on the same line you almost have more respect for the guys youve battled in the past even a guy like steve ott who i know ill enjoy playing with itll probably bring my penalty minutes down a bit because it seems i always ended up fighting or scrapping with one of those guys itll be tough for other teams to play against me brenden modano ribeiro and richards and ott its going to be a lot of fun
4622578 ive proven myself in the playoffs and thats the part of the season that i consider the most exciting time
4622579 i feel i can bring a physical presence whether thats a kick start or bringing something else to the table i feel itll certainly help our chances against a team like detroit or san jose or anaheim or whoever we face in the playoffs
4622580 when you put the jersey on you represent the team and the city and i certainly do cross the line at times but its not out of anything other than wanting to win the game
4622581 i think im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expecting a lot out of me
4622582 its a nice feeling knowing i could be in a situation where players will be together for a four or five year span
4622583 thats what you want to have an opportunity to win two or three cups in a four or five year period detroit is a perfect example theyve kept their nucleus together and brought in a few other guys and it has worked
4622584 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4622585 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4622625 too many of our streets bike trails and light poles are in disrepair and we cannot wait any longer we have to act and we have to act now otherwise the problems will get even worse and more expensive to solve

4622630 i hope you will grow up gentle and good and never learn bad ways do your work with a good will lift your feet up well when you trot and never bite or kick even in play
4622631 since when did slip n slide become an x treme sport
4622632 i think what it shows is we have a very competitive marketplace here in saskatchewan and the companies are responding to that
4622633 they see a royalty structure they see a regulatory structure they see a business climate that is very very positive
4622634 the companies look at it bid what they think is appropriate and then as the ministry we look and see whether we feel that its competitive or not
4622635 in this case we didnt think that was the case and withdrew them
4622636 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
4622637 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
4622638 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
4622639 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
4622640 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
4622641 we made a switch with elton ford in front of matt harris and weve got to catch somebodys attention somebody has to deserve to move up there its not just a move that is dropped out of a hat weve got to be able to have those guys understand that this is written in pencil but its not etched in stone because were not there yet with our older players we have no leadership now in our older players they dont understand the tempo of what we expect out of them and im disappointed in that as is our head coach the thing is theyve got to grow up and do it our way or were going to move on period
4622642 it might be me the teams previously weve been snakebit but you go on to the next day ok you cant control that wed like to have our players understand the difference between pain and injury if theyre injured they dont practice if they have pain theyve got to work through that thats what were looking for we actually have more kids out on the field that have just as much pain as the guys that have decided to not do this but theyre fighting through it so if you go back to leadership thats how you build leadership thats how you build toughness its not anything other than that a quality injury you have to respect its a matter of when they come back but our kids have got to understand they have to play with pain man they do bottom line
4622643 right now as coaches we go out there with more emotion than our players do we cant play anymore weve got to generate that momentum and that motivation to them but its how they respond to that theyre either going to sit down around their neck and their shoulders and go why is he picking on me or theyre going to bristle up and get after it and do it the way we want now that is the type of player were looking for and until we get that were not going to be able to go on any further than that weve got to learn how to practice our way friday was a little bit beter in the morning but the inconsistency that carries over to the afternoon thats us right now and we dont understand its not one day on one day off one practice on the next practice off its consistency that comes with maturity and toughness and toughness starts here in the heart and here pointing to his head when everything else starts getting weak the mind gets stronger right now everything is weak our minds our weak write it i want them to hear it because the thing is if thats the case were standing them up and pointing them out next time were going to get tough and thats what we expect out of them
4622644 this is about team this is not about individual this is about us so im not poiting that out to anybody im not going to call anybody out maybe its back on me putting it right back at me to be honest with you my 9 1 2 shoe should be halfway up their track right now all right
4622645 c mo seguir adelante si t eres mi obst culo desear a que comprendas que esto no puede continuar
4622646 providing access to my corporate network would place me in violation of my employment contract and nondisclosure agreement
4622647 it would also place me in violation of nondisclosure agreements with public and private u s companies securities laws computer access laws and other such things
4622648 i will give the dhs every single password needed to access and decrypt anything that i can hey ill even give them my password for my company computer whats that doesnt work the password must have changed heres the number of our security director call him and convince him he should disclose the password
4622649 until someone comes up with definitions of what a person possessing data or a device holding data actually means this is going to be a freakin mess common law concepts that apply to possession of physical objects just do not apply whatsoever to data data is a representation not a physical object itself
4622650 heres another idea swap laptops with someone else he doesnt have your passwords and you dont have his just dont go through together
4622651 dont bring a laptop rent one down there and download a live cd with your system on it or bring an empty laptop or one with nothing but dos 2 1 or minix on it i still have a plan 9 boot disk around here somewhere im pretty sure we can always out stupid them
4622652 should you have to explain a wrong number that linked you to a crime organization
4622653 i was on a client site doing incident response in the u s and i had to explain to the people i was subcontracting to that i had to secure delete everything from my machine before heading home as i had no way of knowing the full extent of what was hidden in the directories and web caches of the machines i copied to mine for security analysis i had used removable media for almost everything and the people understood my discomfort at transporting data i wasnt sure of across an international border i would advise the same to anyone else who routinely handles data from dodgy sources
4622654 we want to get on and make sure we are finished in time for the start of the infrastructure work early next year
4622655 extensive planning has gone into the bus route diversions which are designed to result in as little or no disruption for bus passengers
4622656 the job must be finished by the end of november in time for the peak pre christmas spending weekend i hope businesses do not suffer 1 per cent of what those in leith walk suffered during tram works but im sure they will
4622657 i never learned anything about penguins or making speeches in zoos when i was going through training
4622658 scotland and norway have long historical connections with each other and this is a very important occasion for both the tattoo and our capital city
4622659 this years festival covers an 1 800 year span from the romans to the napoleonic wars people can come and see and experience history
4622660 for the vikings the longship was like their soul and so it was wonderful to sail across the water and invade
4622661 my wife to be was involved and i just went along to check it out and its fascinating the members have a very deep interest in history and you learn so much more by participating
4622662 it not just people in a muddy field wielding swords at each other it has become much more appreciated as a way to evaluate and understand history
4622663 he sells quality material from natural fibres which are suitable for costume making and at a price far below what youd find in any high street shop which is why the cash conscious re enactors use him
4622664 this was a benefit fraud it was blatant it was persistent
4622665 when madonna was younger she became the example of if i can do it then you can do it now she has become the example of if you take care of yourself you can keep on going if something is not going well she gets rid of people she seems to know what she wants in life
4622666 its crazy to think that madonna is too old at 50 it is time for someone to be a role model for the over 50s
4622667 madonna is successful because shes doing what she wants not what people want her to do she has got an amazing talent for working with the right people she knows who to work with at the right time
4622668 i think discipline extreme focus and health are all important madonna has a very good mindset she does everything she can for herself whereas a lot of people seem to turn things against themselves she doesnt do drugs she goes training she has a family life and a spiritual life
4622669 since i was 16 people have been telling me i look like madonna i used to live in new york in the same district she lived in and people were always telling me i looked so like her
4622670 when i moved to the uk in 2001 people started telling me i should do a tribute act
4622671 i was working as a waitress at the time and i remember telling someone i dont need to do that i write and sing my own songs then i realised i was carrying coffee
4622672 i wouldnt want to swap with madonna because she has got too much stress
4622673 it doesnt feel comfortable being madonna it doesnt feel cosy and it doesnt feel private and i love privacy
4622674 im a musical comedienne and this is my first edinburgh full show
4622675 i came here first in 2003 and it was buzzing id never seen anything like it and i suddenly felt so alive and so happy and i knew i wanted to do a show here
4622676 at that time i worked out it would probably cost 10 000 to 15 000 to put on a show and you had to be prepared not to see anything back for that you could get everything or you could get nothing
4622677 i did a brilliant party in manchester a couple of weeks ago these people were not terribly wealthy but they had saved up to have me it was all for a woman who was 40 who was a massive madonna fan
4622678 that was one of the best gigs i had ever had i said to them im not madonna but they said to us you are the closest thing to her
4622679 in 2002 there was an awful lot of confidence that the wind industry would be able to grow in scotland quite significantly and quite quickly
4622680 that gave confidence for a lot of positive investment decisions at the time from people like vestas they were hoping the industry would have a regular throughput of planning decisions that would lead to orders
4622681 as a government we are ready to do whatever we can to try and find a sustainable future for the yard
4622682 evaluations have shown that the products for which the factory was designed and streamlined do not generate satisfactory earnings
4622683 forced to adapt to a fast moving environment quite different to that for which they had trained
4622684 it is clear there was a requirement to learn lessons on the job sometimes the hard way
4622685 the decision was made after a careful judgment accepting that while risk can be minimised it can never be removed entirely
4622686 there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4622687 swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire other soldiers quickly shouted at him to stop firing
4622688 the most interesting thing in this years report is that the increase in population between 2006 and 2007 was the highest single year rise since just after the second world war
4622689 the most important factor is migration an increase in birth rate contributed a bit but that would only increase the population of scotland by about 1 000
4622690 in fact the population increased by about 27 000 and the remaining 26 000 was because the number of people coming into scotland exceeded the number of people going out
4622691 its a trend that can be seen over the last five years
4622692 whether it continues or not is the 64 000 dollar question
4622693 the main reasons we are seeing this increase is that there has been a major decline in church attendance and young people feel a bit awkward in engaging with a minister of religion when they dont attend church
4622694 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4622695 our most urgent task is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4622696 the prime minister described russias incursion into georgia as a completely unjustified violation of georgias territorial integrity
4622697 he was different to other young kids who were hyper if they won and wouldnt talk to anybody if they lost if chris was beaten he would have a discussion with his dad about why hed go away work at what hed done wrong and come back better
4622698 winning as a team is quite emotional more so than when you win on your own
4622699 the team is not just these guys kenny and staff its also the support staff theres no question we have the best support team in the world
4622700 we have been dreaming about winning but when your dream actually comes to fruition with the three of us all hitting top form at the same time its an incredible feeling
4622701 to get a gold medal from chris hoy on the first day on the track is absolutely inspirational we are looking forward to his next two events
4622702 but were postponing the celebrations with chris going in two more events we hope theres more to come the party will be on tuesday
4622703 in edinburgh we had the edinburgh racers cycling team based at meadowbank and yes there will be a track in glasgow for the commonwealth games but kids from edinburgh will find it difficult to get there
4622704 unless the facilities are there we cannot build on our sporting success
4622705 we need more facilities we only have velodromes in newport and manchester and if you live near them it is great but otherwise you simply cannot do the sport
4622706 with scotlands reputation for producing world class cyclists this is a massive blow and will ultimately be a destructive move for scottish cycling
4622707 a lot of the professionals will go to manchester but the younger guys will be the ones who suffer as they need to develop and train regularly they wont be able to move to manchester or get through to glasgow all the time and it will affect young scottish cyclists
4622708 in australia there are velodromes and great facilities all over the country their training facilities and development programmes are phenomenal compared to the ones here this is an awful move for scottish cycling

4622738 how do i know this person and how does he know i had a ferret named goliath
4622739 150 dorrar but was such short ride why so much
4622740 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
4622741 we dont want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
4622742 this qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters it will promote a can do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build
4622743 it is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils it may be that some pupils will respond but i would be sceptical
4622744 it is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike
4622745 there have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function
4622746 the ssta has no objection to anything that retains contact between children and the education system
4622747 the protest took some planning because there are chinese police all over beijing at the moment there is a crackdown on security luckily as a rock climber i had the skills to put the protest into practice
4622748 at 5 30am beijing time we climbed up the tv building we were arrested about 30 minutes after he let the banner go
4622749 we were taken away in a van to a chinese police station
4622750 we were then split up and werent taken to cells i dont know if that is because they didnt want us to see the conditions the prisoners are usually kept in instead we were taken to offices it just goes to show the difference that having a british passport has
4622751 it implied somewhat better trade prospects towards the year end
4622752 the regional government of catalonia enacted an emergency action plan to bring in fresh food and fuel supplies after nearly half of its forecourts ran dry and supermarkets shelves were left bare
4622753 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
4622754 the best and only way you can save the world is to follow jesus and commit your heart mind and life to him
4622755 woah did you see that moustache i cant believe he
4622756 the thing i liked when he was up here before was his plane
4622757 his plane was almost always downhill more often than not he had tilt to the slider
4622758 with ronnie coming back from plantar fasciitis and trying to take care of the other bullpen arms it was a good time for us to get another multi use arm from omaha
4622759 when i came up i had a lot to prove
4622760 i wasnt one of those players who was going to be given anything i was going to have to work hard i was going to do that anyway i wanted to prove i deserved to be here and could help a team win
4622761 is to show that i can compete at this level and help a team win usually when you go about your business that way everything else falls into place ive been fortunate its falling into a good place for me right now
4622762 and im hoping to play saturday the pain isnt as bad before it was just shooting down my legs my legs felt dead
4622763 at night i was waking up every two hours its better thats not happening anymore
4622764 the thing i liked when he was up here before was his plane
4622765 his plane was almost always downhill more often than not he had tilt to the slider
4622766 with ronnie coming back from plantar fasciitis and trying to take care of the other bullpen arms it was a good time for us to get another multi use arm from omaha
4622767 when i came up i had a lot to prove
4622768 i wasnt one of those players who was going to be given anything i was going to have to work hard i was going to do that anyway i wanted to prove i deserved to be here and could help a team win
4622769 is to show that i can compete at this level and help a team win usually when you go about your business that way everything else falls into place ive been fortunate its falling into a good place for me right now
4622770 and im hoping to play saturday the pain isnt as bad before it was just shooting down my legs my legs felt dead
4622771 at night i was waking up every two hours its better thats not happening anymore
4622772 its not the same swing hes not utilizing his lower half like he normally does
4622773 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4622774 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4622775 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4622776 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4622777 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4622778 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4622779 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4622780 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california
4622781 i violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads a lot of people thought it was because of grades but i go to class every day im going overseas for a year and hopefully ill be able to come back and get picked in the draft this was hard because i was working out with the team every day and getting ready for the season
4622782 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
4622783 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
4622784 operate wider and better to safeguard the security of citizens
4622785 daily in eboli we see drug dealing fights knifings and other violent crime but the mayor has decided to crack down on kissing
4622786 the town is overrun with vandals and public buildings are in need of restoration and here we have our mayor imposing fines of up to 500 on courting couples caught kissing
4622787 if the threat to public security is seen by the mayor of eboli as a couple kissing then heaven help us all
4622788 the public and particularly householders are entitled to be protected from violent and anti social behaviour
4622789 this case highlights the way prison is now a very limited deterrent
4622790 kenny macaskill is quite happy for people to be released after a quarter of their sentence with a tag there are innumerable crimes being committed by people released early
4622791 a lot of persistent offenders spend their lives in and out of prison particularly those who commit petty offences for which they receive short sentences
4622792 probation and community service tend to be used to try and deal with people who have drug or alcohol problems and so tackle the source of the offending
4622793 but there are those who dont have problems or for whom rehab hasnt worked and the courts have few other options but to punish them with jail
4622794 energy companies enjoy a massive subsidy when many families are in a desperate struggle to pay bills
4622795 this multi million pound windfall should be used to protect the most vulnerable from fuel poverty
4622796 this could provide revenue to fund measures to help alleviate fuel poverty
4622797 we have lost this from our lives people have become sleepy in their souls but the wolf brings a little bit of fear and reminds us that beyond our limits is the greatness of nature
4622798 they have a good chance of recovering and thriving here if we give them the chance its a good start
4622799 some newspapers write things like they will eat your children
4622800 germans always need to be fearful of something the question is do we deserve wolves im not always sure we do
4622801 if these five fields are tied in and have processing at sullom voe then the next 15 would almost certainly use the same infrastructure so to try to get a processing hub at sullom voe is important for quite a long time ahead for shetland
4622802 this may be one of the last big trunk pipelines in the whole of the uk continental shelf and to get one which ensures that all the fields are exploited is what we as a nation are looking for
4622803 storing oil as a strategic reserve would fill 16 tanks and sit there for 20 years bringing no business for the harbour authority we need sullom voe to be an active harbour
4622804 the terminal puts a lot of money and wages into the local economy and we need a vibrant economy to give our young people the confidence to come back to shetland and raise their families here
4622805 we want the uk government to look at this in a strategic context and recognise that shetland can fulfil all their strategic objectives we need the compression technology to be developed to ensure that recovery is maximised at sullom voe
4622806 if nothing happens the council will have to say to the oil industry theres no point in us running the harbour any more because we cant make any money out of it and the terminal would have to close shortly after that
4622807 the wording was inappropriate it was too strong by putting too strong a wording it can change the message you want to get across and that happened i regret it it was injudicious language and i am sorry for going that far
4622808 those who flout the law will face swift and tough action
4622809 we welcome the figures which show a large rise in the number of people being prosecuted for selling drink to people under 18
4622810 we recognise that some retailers have done much to reduce underage sales but are pleased that rogue retailers are beginning to feel the combined force of tough action by the police using test purchasing operations and the licensing boards suspending licences
4622811 im really disappointed that the number of retailers selling alcohol to minors has doubled in the last year
4622812 it is important to emphasise that no final decisions have been taken but this report will inform future work

4622858 one of the major reasons is the perceived difficulty of german for the vast majority of people spanish is simpler and easier to learn
4622859 plus so many more people go on holiday to spanish speaking countries than go to german speaking nations
4622860 so if there are fewer german teachers there will be fewer opportunities it is self perpetuating
4622861 with the emphasis on transferable skills that can be applied internationally it is of no surprise that widely spoken languages such as spanish will become increasingly attractive to learners

4622892 these people think we are stupid we are in the business of gymnastics we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old and they get lined up and the government backs them and the federation runs away there is an age limit and it cant be controlled

4622895 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance before they could use a proper toilet
4622896 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours so they all wore nappies
4622897 now we know what chinese soldiers wear under their uniforms they dont seem quite so menacing

4622937 but he wasnt going to go out because there were hints or suggestions that this is what he might do because he didnt want to be regarded as a coward
4622938 and in the end the cabinet didnt go to john howard as a united body and demand that he stood down

4622955 realtors are reporting heightened interest from buyers more business activity and an increase in pending sales prices also appear to be reaching equilibrium in many areas another encouraging sign that could boost the markets momentum
4622956 as long as the united states economy has bright prospects and particularly as long as florida has good prospects its very hard i think to make a case for a long term picture thats negative

4622959 we came out flat in the first half and let wright state push us around the field
4622960 we made some adjustments at half time and came out in the second half with the type of energy and enthusiasm we expect from ball state soccer we controlled the tempo in the second half and dictated the game on our terms
4622961 today we were able to see some weakness that we need to work on and a lot of strengths that we can build a strong foundation from
4622962 we will take this as a learning experience as a team and we will be ready to face
4622963 growing up in a silent house with parents full of misery is deeply damaging to ones soul
4622964 the best thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother
4622965 is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heat oppressed brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw
4622966 damn it nina where are those white pills with all the little blue polka dots its the only ones that will save you
4622967 i cant help but feel like that to some extent and im not a fatalist
4622968 i think its remarkable that ive been able to survive so much and to have the opportunity to do the right thing i do think we make our own choices but certainly i think i was meant to serve a cause greater than my self interest

4622972 with her its not i want to look good in that dress
4622973 she wanted to start moving around because she thought it would make her feel better
4622974 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
4622975 for a long time i had no regular lessons even when i studied most earnestly it seemed more like play than work everything miss sullivan taught me she illustrated by a beautiful story or poem whenever anything delighted or interested me she talked it over with me just as if she were a little girl herself what many children think of with dread as a painful plodding through grammar hard sums and harder definitions is today one of my most precious memories
4622976 we read and studied out of doors preferring the sunlit woods to the house all my early lessons have in them the breath of the woods the fine resinous odor of pine needles blended with the perfume of wild grapes seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree i learned to think that everything has a lesson and a suggestion everything that could hum or buzz or sing or bloom had a part in my education
4622977 my career has been in public service and i believe this to be an extremely important public service one that you can serve the public and people and i really look forward to it

4622988 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
4622989 i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one

4622994 what i saw in her was an unbelievable need to train
4622995 for her to leg it out like that on the last part the last 50 meters it was unbelievable
4622996 i think its great that someone from a small town like plainsboro to succeed like this

4623016 i havent over raced or over trained and i havent been run down so im sticking to the same philosophy
4623017 i cant really say what happened other than it got jammed a little bit
4623018 so i needed some help and came out of the game ill get treatment ice and well go from there
4623019 the team said i jinxed them because i told them to look at the clock and the score was 19 4
4623020 and then they scored a bunch of points that was a big letdown that was a wakeup call
4623021 we want to win so its just part of the game
4623022 i think we had much better push during each stroke particularly toward the beginning of the race i think we learned a lot from our first race and the change in the rhythm to make the boat drive faster right as the blades go into the water
4623023 it is a real honor to be in an olympic final and each of the guys in my boat is really excited about racing on sunday
4623024 i would like to think that with young players like anderson cristiano ronaldo and wayne rooney theres improvement there all right
4623025 we do take these tournaments seriously absolutely when we won the club world championship in 1999 for some reason it seemed to have been passed over but we are the only british team to have won it liverpool tried five times in fact it is three i cant understand why we did not get the praise or the publicity that we deserved for that to win a world championship halfway around the world and beat the best team in south america at that time palmeiras was a great achievement

4623032 there will be a discontinuation of the current propellant cfc thats in bronchodilator rescue inhalers
4623033 many patients have already made the switch to the hfa propellant and in many cases they may not even realize they made the switch because the medication remains the same and works the same
4623034 it doesnt linger very long in your mouth its not a bad taste its just a medicine y taste
4623035 if i am going to be participating in a sport where im going to be running a lot or biking a lot then i will just take a quick puff right before
4623036 i get lots of watery eyes and runny nose and mostly have to stay indoors
4623037 so one of the ideas is that stress causes certain chemicals to be poured into the blood
4623038 these could cause some inflammation and that inflammation can lead on to worsening of your allergies
4623039 although i have a lot of allergies they found out today that im also under a lot of stress lately
4623040 a lot of things that i get which are sinus infections and upper respiratory infections are all brought on mostly by allergies
4623041 there are certain exercises that are really soothing swimming is one of them
4623042 why are we have helped to defend thus in south vietnam

4623044 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up the worst that can happen and decide whether you can live with that
4623045 the worst that could happen is thatthe leg would have broken down and id not have been able to make it but i knew after what happened in athens that i could deal with that if it happened
4623046 it is just something that is very important to me i have fought harder than i ever have to get to this point so i just want to go out and do everything justice
4623047 threw up because i had a spag bol and they found i was wheat intolerant
4623048 ive always been able to fall apart and come back
4623049 that is probably my first olympic memory sitting in my mum and dads bed to watch it
4623050 but the olympic marathon is not a race that i ever want to watch on television and wonder what i could have done i knew i was taking a gamble by coming back but they were calculated risks because i was never running through pain
4623051 i have put myself in as good a position as i could have done
4623052 having got this far gives me a mental lift going into the race
4623053 if i had run a perfect race in athens it would not have been any different
4623054 two weeks before i was in outstanding shape but things fell apart my body was just not healthy enough to start this year i am healthy
4623055 this is very welcome news and many schools who have still not received complete results will undoubtedly feel some sense of vindication
4623056 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4623057 i hope that instead of finding another company to mark future key stage three test papers for 14 year olds the government will scrap these expensive and unnecessary tests altogether
4623058 ets demonstrated pure incompetence when it came to marking this years tests many children are still waiting for their results which are now nearly six weeks late ministers must confirm that ets will not receive a single penny for the fiasco
4623059 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments

4623069 she didnt know them too well but they would say hello and have a chit chat and said they were very nice she is very scared after what happened she was literally feet away when the murders were being carried out and yet she heard nothing
4623070 it is really them oh my god how come they both are wonderful people the girl always smiles and the boy is very well mannered
4623071 my friend told me they were planning to return back to china getting married and start a small business
4623072 the deceased man was my classmate in my language class hes pretty clever and tall too sad he is a very good cook
4623073 killing a cat has no meaning in chinese culture at all if they had had a dog they probably would have killed that its simply a warning sign
4623074 the way in which they were killed was so ruthless that i think it must have been a professional
4623075 we have some triad but compared to other big cities such as manchester theyre third division
4623076 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4623077 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4623078 we are not against general musharraf as a person but we are against the dictators who have subverted the constitution of pakistan they should be made to stand trial
4623079 if the courts find any evidence against him it is for them to decide if the penalty will be death or a life sentence
4623080 he will remain the center of a lot of political attention a lot of anger a lot of resentment and possibly even some revenge
4623081 if he stays it wont be the life of a normal citizen
4623082 the action is surprising the community in blackburn is mainstream any act of terrorism not only does it give a bad name to islam and muslims it has an adverse reaction on race relations
4623083 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us
4623084 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4623085 they keep themselves to themselves they dont speak the father speaks but the sons dont
4623086 they were quite a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4623087 we believe it would be difficult for adecco to improve this offer and justify it to its own shareholders
4623088 there is likely to be short term speculation as to whether adecco will turn its attention to hays or robert walters we would not bank on this given that adecco appeared to be most interested in michael pages brand exposure to permanent recruitment and a specialist model
4623089 given the shares were trading below 250p only five weeks ago the decision by management to reject a 400p cash offer is very brave either they are very upbeat on the outlook for trading or are confident that adecco will return to the table our concern is adecco may shy away from making a higher offer which may struggle to generate a satisfactory return and face shareholder opposition

4623094 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4623095 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4623096 look i got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old
4623097 i am going to teach them first about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby i dont want them punished with an std at age 16 so it doesnt make sense to not give them information
4623098 doom yourself to be a victim for the rest of your life
4623099 in my family the very act of unforgiveness is an extortion of my soul
4623100 it endorses what they did which was to deny the truth and pressure me to sacrifice myself for me not to forgive my brother at my parents behest is my self affirmation
4623101 afterward they didnt leave tools or matches lying around but they never acknowledged what he did to me he continued to behave this way and they continued to insist that i submit my mother would say hes just trying to get close to you because he doesnt know how to be friends shed confuse me by saying it was all out of love and i had no recourse
4623102 i started getting guilt inducing messages from them saying that i was abandoning him and destroying the family they became increasingly angry and accusatory haranguing me to forgive and forget without admitting there was anything to forgive and forget i wrote him a note detailing what he had done and said i wouldnt speak to him until he was willing to acknowledge it he sent me back a letter taking the moral high ground that he was just as hurt as i that all children fight as if these were normal childhood squabbles and that he was willing to let bygones be bygones why couldnt i
4623103 ive taken a strong position that hes out of my life even though my parents still try to bully me into capitulating i know its difficult for them to have two separate sets of holidays but i forbid them to talk to me about it because their pollyanna attitude enrages me
4623104 its not so much what my brother did as a child but what he continues to be as a man that i find unacceptable
4623105 he never changed never grew and just found new ways to feel entitled it would only be right to forgive what he did as a child it would be legitimate and healthy for everybody but it would be wrong not to hold him responsible for being an undeveloped person now i would be colluding in creating a false reality which was what allowed me to be violated in the first place
4623106 my lack of forgiveness has not impeded my development or my relationships at all in fact its cured me
4623107 before i took a stand i was always depressed and acceding to others needs always confused about my rights and about what was real
4623108 in a good relationship not a perfect relationship its different how bad are the screwups if the person is still loving enough it comes naturally
4623109 i need some sense of family as long as they accept my terms
4623110 and with this huge exception they have made genuine efforts in my behalf in recent years
4623111 our sons homosexuality is worse than a death in the family
4623112 theyve raised the stakes too high they actually said that my being gay was a fate worse than death in essence that they would rather i had died when my boyfriend and i broke up and i was devastated my mother said it was an answered prayer they deny that what theyre doing is personal and that its damaging to me this is hatred masked as love i wont go any further its more a process of mourning than of forgiving them
4623113 i wont do it because its just a ritual for him not blood and guts real forgiveness has to be based on working to change he wants me to forgive him for what hes going to keep doing
4623114 complete detachment isnt any more healthy than fusion but i wont be careful or quiet any longer
4623115 he was a selfish brute who considered his children his property once when i was a teenager he said i can do anything i want with you and he would have if my uncle hadnt threatened to call the police
4623116 people are much too willing to blame others since i moved out 30 years ago my life has been what i make of it im responsible
4623117 people try to convince me that because i didnt make peace with him id suffer for it down the line they feel that there hasnt been closure i think its more about them and their own fathers im fine it hasnt been a trauma for me
4623118 she died of cancer when i was 38 and i was mostly glad to be rid of her
4623119 she was cold uninvolved and rejecting and never interested in me
4623120 by age five i had given up on her i was never sure whether she hated me or was just indifferent i was a burden and a competitor
4623121 to mourn my friend and not my mother seemed like what a monster feels
4623122 it was a shining moment when my analyst said its okay to love your friend more than your mother what had been disturbing me was not so much that she didnt love me but that i didnt love her not loving her meant i was like her a person incapable of love when i realized that i didnt love her because she didnt love me i understood that i could still love i havent forgiven her but im not angry anymore she had some nice qualities like liveliness but in the most important way she was never really my mother
4623123 as ive grown older ive begun to think more about what i need screw it i dont have to forgive anymore
4623124 i felt terribly sorry for her she hasnt been the same person since she lost her husband and son a few years ago and shes all alone
4623125 i dont believe in carrying grudges at this point in my life
4623126 but how long could i continue to ignore my own feelings i was always very timid and never opened my mouth but now that has changed
4623127 i was the one who was always pressured to do the right thing
4623128 that was my script id give in to keep the peace but i cant and wont do it anymore her problems are not my fault and the way she vanished when our father got sick was inexcusable i used to cry and curse her now im civil im no longer capable of forgiving her whether she deserves it or not
4623129 it never worked in the past and now if i tell her how i feel ill be punished i dont wish her harm but i want nothing to do with her on an emotional level
4623130 at my fathers funeral i saw what a miserable person she was a tormented soul who hasnt connected to anybody
4623131 i feel that really wonderful sense of indifference you have when you break up with somebody and you think youll never get over the pain and then one day you bump into each other on the street and wonder how you ever felt that way
4623132 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation dont have maps and i believe that our education like such as in south africa and the iraq and everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the u s should help the u s or should help south africa and should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for us
4623133 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
4623134 his encouragement is to be zealous in love in patience in unselfishness
4623135 poverty abuse discrimination racism and arbitrariness and or indifference by the state
4623136 in 1969 women heads of households smashed the doors at the ayacucho food market after the police closed it during the demonstrations an elderly woman delivered a furious and spontaneous speech to the masses 8
4623137 if official attempts at popular mobilization and social redistribution seemed to generate a radicalization even more difficult to control then better to stop velascos ill fated experiments and once again court the confidence of the investing classes
4623138 enormous pool of radical young people of amalgamated rural urban identity who would provide an effective revolutionary force
4623139 the education system was the greatest source of cadres for the left
4623140 women like men are seen as a combination of social relations historically formed and changing as a function of the variations in society as it develops women are thus a social product and their transformation demands the transformation of society
4623141 preach womens liberation simply making some adjustments to this decrepit society
4623142 have bourgeoisie and revisionist positions and serve as instruments of oppression and backwardness for women with the aim of pulling them off the path that the proletariat and the people have traversed with the peoples war
4623143 the success of the revolution depends on the degree to which the women participate
4623144 women represent half the population and they are a force determining the failure or success of the revolution
4623145 by 1981 half of ayacuchos teachers had received their degrees from the shining path controlled unsch education department
4623146 perus traditional andean peasant culture is quite a lot more rigid than prevailing in the urban areas peasant women who would stray from their husbands are severely punished but sexual harassment and adultery on the part of men is rather prevalent on the other hand where the party established its influence divorce is introduced and sexual harassment is not tolerated
4623147 only the direct and massive participation of revolutionary women principally working women
4623148 in the the revolution remains the sole guarantee of genuine defense and promotion of womens rights within a real and concrete path of liberation
4623149 lack ing a sense of justice womens flaw is to be too indulgent or too severe and they like cats have a mischievous inclination for cruelty
4623150 it was as if nature had delivered a totally new creature it frightened and gave guerillas an aura of unnatural witchy power
4623151 they mistreated the mayor and the chief tax collectors of theses districts in a cruel and inhumane way and left them fatally wounded
4623152 until a little while ago i thought the shining path was wrong headed but that they in some way wanted to fight for some kind of justice
4623153 now they have touched grassroots organizations made up of the poorest people who participates in the soup kitchens and the glass of milk program people who cant afford to eat in their houses so i dont understand this unbalanced group they want to snuff out survival organizations so that levels of malnutrition and death rise
4623154 womens new prominence as citizen subjects with their own political organizations and agendas has left an important and probably irreversible legacy
4623155 never knew when one of the policemen who had raped her would pass her on the street and smile that secret smile of knowing
4623156 when i searched women the first thing i did was undress them old or young i stuck my fingers in them just the same you may not believe me but there was one time when i found one explosive pardon me two its because they have big cunts
4623157 so from that moment i began to search all the cholas sometimes little girls thirteen years old they were sluts
4623158 one of the most heart wrenching sections of the commission report documents case after case of torture of women revolutionaries by the military and police
4623159 the commission concludes that sexual violence against women by the armed forces of the state was a generalized practice that took on a systematic character connected to the repression of the subversives in the provinces of ayacucho huancavelica and apurimac
4623160 one of the things that really stands out about the peoples war in peru is how steadfastly the pcp peruvian communist party has struggled against womens oppression and how it has led the masses against every form of degradation faced by women in peru
4623161 missing the revolution anthropologists and the peoples war in peru

4623163 missing the revolution anthropologists and the peoples war in peru
4623164 on poor relations and the nouveau riche shining path and the radical peruvian left
4623165 disarming the subject remembering war and imagining citizenship in peru
4623166 villagers at arms war and counterrevolution in the central south andes
4623167 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4623168 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4623169 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4623170 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4623171 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4623172 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4623173 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4623174 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4623175 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4623176 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4623177 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4623178 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4623179 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4623180 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4623181 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4623182 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4623183 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4623184 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4623185 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4623186 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4623187 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4623188 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4623189 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4623190 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4623191 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4623192 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4623193 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4623194 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4623195 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4623196 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4623197 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4623198 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4623199 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4623200 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4623201 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4623202 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
4623203 its easier for our software to compete with linux when theres piracy than when theres not
4623204 our computer recognizes the hard drive but theres nothing on it
4623205 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim

4623213 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4623214 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4623215 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
4623216 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation

4623231 most health care workers do their jobs with care compassion and professionalism
4623232 but sometimes professionalism breaks down and caregivers engage in behaviors that threaten patient safety it is important for organizations to take a stand by clearly identifying such behaviors and refusing to tolerate them

4623234 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4623235 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4623236 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4623237 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4623238 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy

4623260 even if a small business has a client thats unlikely to go out of business such as a federal government client small businesses should ensure they have no more than 25 percent of income generated by one source you can diversify by industry department product sold or other factors depending on the nature of your business

4623271 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
4623272 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
4623273 none of the existing payment systems we use on earth like cash credit or debit cards could be used in space

4623282 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4623283 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4623284 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4623313 we are absorbing the costs the investment is at the expense of tesco not the farmers
4623314 the supermarkets are telling us they will pay for price cuts out of their own money but we have bitter experience of what happens in the medium to long term
4623315 if farmers cant recoup those increases they will end up not producing next year and if production falls then prices will rise further
4623316 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help
4623317 negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4623318 the fact that prices are going up at shop level does not mean the farmers are getting more

4623320 a lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff

4623322 a great deal of confusion exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations
4623323 thinking he had seen a muzzle flash he swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash almost immediately the troops began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall as did his driver
4623324 had been hurried that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4623325 in hindsight it is highly likely that l cpl ford had already instantaneously died from his wounds
4623326 if i did not think we were ready to deploy and if i did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully i would not have allowed them to go
4623327 while the death of lance corporal ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4623328 it is not the case that the brigade involved was under prepared or under resourced there clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation and the royal marines themselves will be looking at that soon
4623329 the system is not set in stone im open to reform long term there are a number of things were looking at the making good progress pilot is one of those but it would be wrong to rush into a change straight away
4623330 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009

4623347 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out
4623348 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort despite being urged not to
4623349 every day shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4623350 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4623351 it is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4623352 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4623353 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4623354 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4623355 its going to be a tough race tomorrow and even though i have a 12 point margin you can never have enough

4623358 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4623359 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4623360 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4623361 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4623362 on base percentage is the highest thing on the list
4623363 if youve proven that you can get on base that will give you the best chance to lead off sanity at last that cant be though larussa is respected by baseball people baseball people are all morons ergo larussa is a moron you cant just not tear his quotes apart line by line because he makes a good point it doesnt mean its the only thing say molina has an on base percentage of 700 in spring training i dont think im going to lead him off because he clogs those bases a little bit but im going to wait let guys play
4623364 in fact shit mo leen a aint pert near qualified to bat leaderoff with an oh bee pee of eight hundredteen

4623368 go after al qaeda in pakistan without asking musharrafs permission
4623369 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4623370 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4623371 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement
4623372 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4623373 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4623374 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4623375 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4623376 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4623377 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4623378 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4623379 we enter our period of time before our convention in a very strong position
4623380 every public survey we have seen indicates that we have effectively consolidated the base around john mccain we have a higher intensity of support around our republican base than the democrats have around theirs
4623381 young people throughout the primaries and caucuses were overwhelmingly on obamas side over hillary clinton and the other democratic candidates
4623382 and in the polls so far in the general election there is a huge age gap with younger people backing obama by double digits and older people people over 50 and people over 65 for sure supporting senator mccain
4623383 so if we write n in the form n 2 m l where 2 m is the largest power of 2 not exceeding n and where l is whats left the solution to our recurrence seems to be
4623384 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
4623385 the olympic games is not a race which i ever want to watch on television and think what could i have done in there
4623386 you get in there and give it your best shot
4623387 obviously i could have done with more time and when your biggest week of actual running is two weeks before the race it is not an ideal preparation
4623388 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up what is the worst that can happen and are you ok to live with that but it is a calculated risk

4623394 sometimes at the end of a movie ill panic and wonder did i do a good job then i realize ive been spending too much time alone you go from being surrounded by people working every day and being constantly stimulated back to doing nothing
4623395 another unique singer i checked out is new comer matt morris who is working charlie saxon patty griffin and justin timberlake on his debut album and he has good reason for his seriously soulful voice
4623396 i usually sort of found inspiration in female singers from the 50s 60s and 70s because there is this heart and this vulnerability that comes across and i think in the history of recorded music there is a little more comfort with allowing letting women to put that across like to allow a little bit of soul to show it was just about like passion

4623401 its the third consecutive year depp has topped the list of the ten best signers whether at a premier in a restaurant or on location depp may just be the best hollywood autograph signer of all time
4623402 in a miraculous turnaround actor russell crowe moved from number ten on the 2006 worst list to number ten on the 2007 best list he may still be a bit grumpy at times but now he signs pretty much anytime someone asks
4623403 whats so frustrating about will ferrell being the worst autograph signer this past year is that he used to be so nice to fans and collectors and a great signer what makes him so bad is that hell taunt people asking for his autograph

4623407 its inspiring to be chosen to tell the story of albert einstein this film will bring us closer to his genius his imagination his discoveries and to the drama and charm of his human side i look forward to delivering my script as soon as possible after the wga strike concludes
4623408 the situation characters and dialogue are authentic and engaging and the performances from the cast were superb the film has exceeded all of our expectations and i think it will be very popular with both audiences and critics
4623409 due to the film tax credit program we have been able to attract productions even to some of the most rural areas of the commonwealth
4623410 when is the last time mckean county was the location of a 4 million film production this is an incredible experience and economic opportunity for our communities
4623411 program to provide tax credits to film and television productions who agree to spend at least 60 percent of their total production cost in pennsylvania to date 28 9 million of the 75 million available has been committed statewide
4623412 in addition to the 115 jobs that are estimated to be generated this investment will have a ripple effect for everyone from hotels and restaurants to the local drycleaner all will see additional business
4623413 it should be clear we are not trading tax dollars for 15 minutes of fame these are jobs that our communities would not have seen without the tax credit program
4623414 on tuesday of this week senator cornyn spoke to a pachyderm club meeting in houston that was covered by the houston chronicle
4623415 senator says state is a model for nation despite having so many without insurance
4623416 in his remarks senator cornyn did not talk about health insurance at all instead while relating several reasons why texass economy is in better shape than most other u s states he mentioned the 2003 law reforming medical malpractice law in texas since its passage doctors and medical school graduates have been flocking to texas providing health care services in underserved areas and improving patient access in others the development has made texas the envy of the medical community nationwide and several states are attempting to duplicate our accomplishment
4623417 after his remarks senator cornyn was approached by the chronicle reporter who raised the entirely separate subject of health insurance for the first time senator cornyn did not disagree that there were too many uninsured in texas and added there were numerous steps that need to be taken to reduce that unacceptably high number in fact senator cornyn has pushed for a variety of solutions including funding for community health clinics enabling small businesses to pool their resources to offer group health insurance increased outreach efforts to boost schip enrollment and more
4623418 so you have to understand what i mean when i say i want to make washington d c and the rest of our country more like texas because frankly we know the policies that actually work
4623419 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
4623420 while the studios are making 100 200 million 3 d blockbusters indie film methods can be used to create high quality polarized 3 d features in the 5 15 million range
4623421 similar to what roger corman accomplished at american international pictures in the 1960s and 70s such a low budget 3 d production facility could serve as a fertile testing ground for new talent pushing the boundaries of this exciting new platform
4623422 with faltering theatrical ticket sales pirating and more and more audience members watching movies at home the film industry appreciates the need to offer ticket buyers a radically new and unique movie going experience
4623423 for all the recent advances in home theater technology and portable devices nothing beats the experience of seeing a movie in a theater
4623424 we hope to fill the voids left between the big studios tent pole blockbuster releases
4623425 stereovision will provide summer popcorn movies for 3 d equipped theaters to show year round
4623426 s vamos a participar en la reuni n por supuesto es un tema de inter s nacional y que obliga a todos los gobiernos a tener definici n sobre el tema
4623427 sobre todo este tema muy particularmente es que se tenga el dise o de una estrategia compartida
4623428 tenemos un problema serio de inseguridad en el pa s y tenemos que hacer una depuraci n gradual de nuestras polic as
4623429 corporaciones que tenemos que reconocer est n infiltradas est n viciadas hay corrupci n en ellas
4623430 esas son las polic as que tenemos en los distintos niveles de gobierno dif cilmente una corporaci n puede estar exenta de esta condici n sea municipal sea estatal sea federal
4623431 no distingue de qu polic a se trata y no puede hacer distintas a las polic as todas son polic as
4623432 si uno aplica la f rmula el resultado que dar a ser a un precio del petr leo de 80 d lares
4623433 es un reflejo de que ha madurado y que nos permite contar con una econom a que se desenvuelve bien
4623434 en ese contexto debemos sentirnos tranquilos de las cifras que hoy tenemos
4623435 pero s lo lo podemos hacer si la autoridad da una respuesta real ya no queremos discursos ya no queremos que nos digan que s lo van a hacer lo que hemos venido exigiendo es que queremos fechas y queremos que nos digan c mo
4623436 los cuales le vamos a ir contando a las autoridades
4623437 nosotros lo que queremos hacer es un gran esfuerzo para que la gente denuncie todo lo que tenga que ver con ese delito
4623438 yo creo que en este momento nuestros pol ticos tienen que estar a la altura todos porque este es un problema de los gobiernos estatales del distrito federal y del gobierno federal pero principalmente en el tema del secuestro es de los gobiernos estatales y queremos que est n a la altura de los ciudadanos
4623439 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4623440 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4623441 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4623442 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4623443 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4623444 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4623445 i have only praise it was the best organized event i attended i went home feeling well briefed empowered and more effective

4623451 i remember having a conversation about the job with terry in a bar in london and he said the answer might be in front of you
4623452 wed had difficulties in the club in the changing room towards the end of the previous season which gareth had been really important in solving
4623453 i was speaking to other people but i always had gareth in mind and the more i thought about it and the more conversations i had with gareth the more i agreed with terry gareths a very intelligent lad and because of his intellect and ability to learn quickly i asked him to do something very different and difficult
4623454 so it was not difficult to support him at certain times but hes come through that and hes learnt tremendously hes learnt to cope with the pressure it was a huge immense responsibility for him to cope with everything and hes done that very very well
4623455 i understand the question but im not going to answer it
4623456 but coming straight from the dressing room to the managers chair who wouldnt have a period of self doubt its probably a strength to admit it but gareth had the quality to get out of it and he has
4623457 ive seen gareth as a player behind the scenes when things werent going well and hed get a situation by the throat and mould it to where he wanted it to be
4623458 he is a nice man but hes got a spine of steel i certainly wouldnt cross gareth too far
4623459 we had a discussion and gareth was content to let that player go
4623460 aston villa contacted me about two players the first one
4623461 sometimes you sell to buy other players there is a tipping point you ask
4623462 hemos establecido como pol tica p blica reconocer que la basura no es un desperdicio sino un recurso valioso que no tiene sentido enterrar en un vertedero

4623464 appearance clones on the same vertical or horizontal plane were easily detected
4623465 that could be important for reconstructing a stadium crowd youd make sure no clones lie side by side either vertically or horizontally
4623466 as hibernian did on many occasions at ibrox and celtic park we won football matches there against teams that were hugely bigger in size in quality of players in everything and yet we could go and win 3 0 at ibrox twice
4623467 it gives you hope to know that you could if you get it right on the day beat a team that youve got no right to and the players have got to believe that so we will go there believing we can do it if we do our jobs
4623468 theres always this debate in football about whether its about winning or whether its about entertaining and i think generally arsenal have got that balance right you could argue that arsenal have not won the premier league for a few years but is that a negative with chelsea spending millions and manchester united being there what i do know is arsenal dont spend hundreds of millions continue to play fantastic football and continue to be in the top four
4623469 show where we are as a football club and a group
4623470 i feel loyal to the supporters and everyone at the club but even more so to my players we have a relationship here youve heard them talk about the spirit we have here and i want them to succeed for that to happen im the one that has to bring new players in and at the moment i feel i am letting them down
4623471 we had a great opportunity from where we were to try and kick on at the end of last season
4623472 i understand the reasons why we couldnt and the next bit now is to get on with it and not moan about it not every football manager is lucky enough to be gifted with a lot of cash but i am concerned we need full houses at goodison and what does that the team people have watched everton recently because weve been doing well
4623473 the market is harder to buy in now there arent as many players i felt the best time to increase the squad was at the end of last season or at least to start then weve started a little bit later than that
4623474 weve had some tough times since that first year in the super league but thats made the success were having now even sweeter
4623475 it was a battle just to keep the club going in the early days and guys like seamus mccallion and people who worked off the field like phyllis thorman didnt get the credit they deserved
4623476 we had a bit more success under dean thomas with an influx of australian players and some london based lads but it was only when dave woods arrived a couple of years ago that we decided that things had to change
4623477 we werent a club we were only a team and that was never going to work in the longer term so we started to concentrate on junior development and working with local businesses it was a massive gamble and last year we suffered a bit on the field as a result
4623478 but the pre season last winter was the hardest ive ever worked in my life and im sure most of the lads would say the same we were training six days a week on the back of normal jobs because everyone is part time and fortunately its paid off with the results weve had this season
4623479 youll see luke mccown and hopefully youll see all of the quarterbacks play but well see how the game goes
4623480 hopefully by early next week hell be doing a little bit more

4623488 since the beginning we recognized short films as a viable art form and an exciting way to discover and launch new talent
4623489 we will continue to find innovative ways to extend the success and reach of this amazing work and build a world wide audience for short form films
4623490 this year we received a record number of submissions including some of the most dynamic work weve seen in years
4623491 we are really proud to present the entire shorts program which represents a higher level of filmmaking craft than ever before the work is extremely broad and ranges from outrageous animation to fascinating short documentaries to original and wild comedies to outstanding dramas
4623492 its inspiring to be chosen to tell the story of albert einstein this film will bring us closer to his genius his imagination his discoveries and to the drama and charm of his human side i look forward to delivering my script as soon as possible after the wga strike concludes
4623493 never before has art been so close to and tied in with advertising
4623494 we wanted to produce something that would be pure entertainment something that was true to our philosophy that its not enough now to buy audience time we need to create advertising that the audience chooses to spend time with
4623495 im very pleased that weve been able to put our differences behind us so that we may begin a new chapter with our old friends at new line the lord of the rings is a legacy we proudly share with bob and michael and together we share that legacy with millions of loyal fans all over the world we are delighted to continue our journey through middle earth i also want to thank harry sloan and our new friends at mgm for helping us find the common ground necessary to continue that journey
4623496 peter jackson has proven himself as the filmmaker who can bring the extraordinary imagination of tolkien to life and we full heartedly agree with the fans worldwide who know he should be making the hobbit
4623497 now that we are all in agreement on the hobbit we can focus on assembling the production team that will capture this phenomenal tale on film
4623498 we are very pleased we have been able to resolve our differences and that peter and fran will be actively and creatively involved with the hobbit movies we know they will bring the same passion care and talent to these films that they so ably accomplished with the lord of the rings trilogy
4623499 peter is a visionary filmmaker and he broke new ground with the lord of the rings
4623500 were delighted hes back for the hobbit films and that the tolkien saga will continue with his imprint we greatly appreciate the efforts of harry sloan who has been instrumental in helping us reach our new accord
4623501 does that mean it will certainly be running are there situations when listed trains dont run
4623502 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4623503 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4623504 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4623505 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4623506 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4623507 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4623508 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4623509 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4623510 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4623511 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4623512 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4623513 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4623514 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4623515 i think the people watching the hallmark channel are happy to see us
4623516 other networks dont always have places for us but hallmark provides a comfort zone for viewers who want to see people they know
4623517 i feel very strongly about the baby boomer generation and theyre sorely neglected on tv
4623518 were the fastest growing segment of the population and i think advertisers forget that we are the ones with the most money for that reason im very grateful to hallmark
4623519 they have assets not allowances this demographic spends 17 trillion annually theyre loyal television viewers and they remain a consumer force to be reckoned with
4623520 theres a built in following for so many of these actors and that allows us with our resources to be able to get publicity

4623553 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4623574 john mccains response to this discredited book speaks volumes he is a george bush candidate running a karl rove campaign with a dick cheney sense of humor

4623604 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4623605 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4623609 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4623610 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4623611 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4623612 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4623616 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4623617 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4623618 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4623619 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4623620 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4623621 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4623622 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4623623 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4623624 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4623625 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4623626 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4623627 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4623658 there is no question about the effort put in by the pakistan cricket board and the pakistan government the security plans are outstanding
4623659 theyre the best weve ever seen for cricket but the fact is they are unproven and we dont know if the plans can be delivered we need to see them demonstrated the threat in pakistan is real theres a lot of political instability and weve seen more reports of activity by the taliban
4623660 if the four nations were reluctant to visit pakistan it was not too late to move the champions trophy to sri lanka we are very short of time now if we are going to shift now it needs to be made within the next few days operationally it would be difficult but its certainly not an option that would be discarded at this point

4623755 we are extremely pleased to announce dan as the head coach for the 2008 09 season
4623756 we interviewed numerous qualified candidates and it was an extremely competitive hiring process dans coaching and administrative experience as well as his extensive knowledge of the california lacrosse community wcll and mcla made him the ideal candidate dan brings 30 years of coaching experience to the table along with a great knowledge of the university its admissions requirements etc we could not be more pleased with the hire
4623757 i am thrilled to have been hired as the head coach for the university of california berkeley mens lacrosse team
4623758 i joined the staff two years ago to help elevate this team back to its previous level of national prominence it has long been my goal to have cal be a viable end destination for the best and brightest players california has to offer playing lacrosse at cal places you in membership in three of the best networks in the country first you are part of the california community second you are part of the cal alumni network and third you are part of the lacrosse nation i am excited for the future potential of this program and look forward to working with these fine young men
4623759 its great to have someone already familiar with the program and the university i think whenever there is a coaching change continuity is always a major concern dan has handled the attack and man up offense over the past few seasons all of the returning players are familiar with dan and his coaching style he was also the point person for the majority of the recruiting of this years incoming class so the new players should already be familiar with him i think what really stood out about dan was his passion for the game and his vision for how this program should operate dan brings more than just the expectation of winning he really values honoring the game and giving back to the community he is of the opinion as that of the alumni and school administration that cal should be a top flight destination for student athletes that want to attend one of the premier universities in the world and take part in a competitive and rewarding lacrosse experience i am glad to see that dan will be an ongoing part of the cal lacrosse family

4623877 knowing human fear of physical reality and the physical truth i have no illusions that most of them including those who reject belief in god without even having examined the information provided will at first be fearful dismissive or offended by my claims unfortunately for humans irrespective of how arrogant this may sound if they want to extend their survival as a species it is either the information disclosed in the revelations of a human space navigator or a foreseeable demise
4623878 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4623879 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4623880 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4623881 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4623882 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4623883 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4623884 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4623885 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4623886 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4623887 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4623888 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4623889 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4623890 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4623891 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4623892 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4623893 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4623894 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4623895 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4623896 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4623897 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4623898 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4623899 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4623900 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4623901 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4623902 if people dont want to come to the ballpark how are you going to stop them

4623927 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4623928 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4623929 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4623930 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4623931 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4623932 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4623933 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4623934 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4623935 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4623936 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4623937 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4623938 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4623939 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4623940 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4623941 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4623942 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4623943 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4623944 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4623945 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4623946 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4623947 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4623948 just so you all know we did set a record
4623949 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4623950 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4623951 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4623952 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4623953 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4623954 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4623955 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4623956 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4623957 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4623958 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4623959 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4623960 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4623961 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4623962 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4623963 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4623964 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4623965 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4623966 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4623967 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4623968 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4623969 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4623970 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4623971 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4623972 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4623973 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4623974 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4623975 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4623976 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4623977 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4623978 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4623979 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4623980 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4623981 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4623982 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4623983 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4623984 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4623985 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4623986 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4623987 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4623988 many of us think he will use that as an excuse for missing all the debates said
4623989 that mr bakers disappearance is not really a top priority
4623990 we may issue an apb if he doesnt turn up somewhere after the election hes not running as a republican so we really give less than a d m

4624019 eu n o senti nada diferente um futebol mais t cnico do que o futebol holand s mas para o goleiro n o muda muita coisa os jogadores das equipes advers rias t m muito mais qualidade e isso para o goleiro faz a diferen a voc tem de estar muito mais atento acho que vim para c no momento certo depois da experi ncia que ganhei no psv acho que me acostumei a jogar na europa j sei como funciona a coisa e isso facilitou muito

4624022 it is false to pretend that i dont care about culture
4624023 what we intend to do is to look at how we can create a new program or new avenues that will be even better performing and with a stronger impact for our culture abroad

4624026 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4624027 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4624028 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4624029 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4624030 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4624031 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4624032 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4624038 a fox rep for prison break confirmed to me that one or two of the shows main characters will die in the season premiere which airs sept 1 at 8 p m at least one actor is leaving the series for good
4624039 we have a new character known simply as wyatt cress williams who is the company guy who is trying to track them this year
4624040 another new character is a hacker named roland our team has learned to have some level of trust among each other or at least they know everyone elses agenda but this is a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily have
4624041 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4624042 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4624043 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4624044 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4624045 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4624046 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4624047 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4624048 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4624049 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4624050 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4624051 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4624052 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4624053 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4624054 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4624055 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4624056 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4624057 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4624058 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4624059 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4624060 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4624061 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4624062 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4624063 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4624064 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4624065 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4624066 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4624067 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4624068 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4624069 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4624070 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4624071 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4624072 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4624073 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4624074 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4624075 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4624076 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4624077 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4624078 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4624079 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4624080 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4624081 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4624082 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4624083 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4624084 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4624085 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4624086 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4624087 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4624088 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4624089 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4624090 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4624091 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4624092 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4624093 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4624094 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4624095 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4624096 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4624097 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4624098 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4624099 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4624100 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4624101 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4624102 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4624103 very clearly are used to help people achieve quite exceptional performances
4624104 its a challenge its the most rewarding part of my career ive ever had
4624105 ive seen athletes with bicycles ive designed get on the dais ive seen paralympians get on the dais when you develop technology and the athletes using it win or do a personal best its addictive its like running the race yourself
4624106 you read the rules first you say to yourself this is what we cant do legally now lets start working out how to make this person go faster
4624107 if it became trendy tomorrow for people to wear prosthetic feet and everybody wanted one they would have to be mass produced and you would get economies of scale
4624108 we know that with this technology we can give disabled people a better quality of life theres a social benefit that flows from having this technology at the paralympics
4624109 the fact that people can now get flex feet commercially in sydney or melbourne rather than having to go to a clinic is great
4624110 its still improving its going ahead in leaps and bounds he says
4624111 in the past there was a lot of trial and error now there is such a database of knowledge built up that we can design something for all types of athletes however it gets very hard to produce technology that gives a dominant edge to a particular athlete
4624112 for people who have poor finger strength they get gloves that have small carbon fibre inserts if you need the ability to have a high drawback of a string in archery for example the gloves give added strength for the fingers
4624113 one of the big problems for athletes is they often below the waist dont have the sense of feeling which means they cant tell when they are getting very cold
4624114 i think what were going to see is that where in the past you had one athlete who had the in built advantage from the technology and with significant ability now you are going to see two or three athletes in particular events with that advantage
4624115 the fact that someone else is pounding along half a metre behind you is going to motivate you the prospect of being beaten is going to motivate you you will see this reflected on the times and the performances and it means that races and competitions will be closer than before
4624116 i think there will always be occasions you will have an outstanding athlete whether its olympics world championships or paralympics there will always be one or two people who will dominate sports but it their time at the top will be for two to three years not two or three paralympics people will be working harder to catch up
4624117 iso master which is claimed to be the best iso editing tool is a graphical editor for iso images
4624118 at the same time you are my enemy we really dont accept this kind of logic
4624119 his wish is to boycott im not aware of any obligation to put on a defense
4624120 does not recognize the legitimacy or validity of these proceedings and therefore does not wish any defense counsel to do anything that purports to be on his behalf
4624121 to proceed without mr al bahlul without mounting a defense destroys any possibility of any appearance of legitimacy and fairness
4624122 in arab countries they do have the trials in absentia
4624123 so this manager here keeps saying kind of well gay things to me
4624124 well he just came back to where i am working and said
4624125 hmm yup that is gay alright in both senses of the word
4624126 i wonder why no women ever hit on me fuck could it be that i am not attractive to lesbians because you know i could be a lesbian i have got the stuff and i know what to do with it my friend
4624127 maybe i can sue for sexual harassment and we can be rich and have you know money and stuff
4624128 okay have a good rest of your day i am going to see a lesbian about a horse or something i will be attractive to lesbians by the days end
4624129 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4624130 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4624131 often don revealing blouses and always have makeup jobs fresh out of a beauty salon
4624132 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4624133 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4624134 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4624135 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4624136 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4624137 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4624138 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4624139 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4624140 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4624141 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4624142 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4624143 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4624144 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4624145 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4624146 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4624147 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4624148 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4624149 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4624150 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4624151 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4624152 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4624153 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4624154 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4624155 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4624156 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4624157 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4624158 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4624159 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4624160 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4624161 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4624162 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4624163 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4624164 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4624165 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4624166 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4624167 making me feel less wonderful about myself than i usually feel
4624168 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in its latest monthly forecast yesterday
4624169 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in
4624170 geopolitical concerns and the realization that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4624171 put ting 1 million plug in hybrid cars cars that can get up to 150 miles per gallon on the road by 2015
4624172 ensure 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025
4624173 implement an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050
4624174 if we took a holiday took some time to celebrate just one day out of life it would be it would be so nice

4624176 in the middle of absolutely no where there stood a village it had once been a prosperous and lovely place to be from people traveled for miles to see it chiefly because it was miles from anywhere it boasted the finest wines freshest breads and sharpest cheeses to be had in any land it boasted but perhaps exaggerated a bit too
4624177 all of our shipping centers are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues
4624178 weve done our internal diagnosis of course but were not going to get into it publicly we worked on it feverishly and we informed all our members
4624179 rest assured that we are taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
4624180 the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4624181 well again be working throughout the night and will update you in the morning thanks for now and continued apologies
4624182 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4624183 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4624184 these are frightening allegations and i can only conclude that she is a risk to public safety
4624185 this type of imagery is not something thats at all typical of downtown baltimore this is a startling occurrence in downtown baltimore professionals
4624186 ze willen wel maar ik ben te bang voor het gespuis in de bajus
4624187 yes thats true the clindamycin probably helped but its your immune system your body that did most of the work
4624188 ick noem dat een h o e r r r
4624189 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4624190 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4624191 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4624192 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4624193 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4624194 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4624195 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4624196 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4624197 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4624198 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4624199 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4624200 the quest of real followers of the path is just to oppose birth and death they do not look for it in the sayings found in various sources in ancient and modern books they just step back into themselves and bring it to mind coolly yet keenly at the very root and stem suddenly their hands slip they lose their footing and theyre lost this is graduation from the study of a lifetime perceiving independently like a solitary lamp for the first time they are manifestly empowered they are like mountains how could the fears of life and death shake them any more
4624201 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4624202 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4624203 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4624204 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4624205 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it
4624206 not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself
4624207 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4624208 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4624209 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4624210 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4624211 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4624212 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4624213 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4624214 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4624215 the two buildings on fire are part of the citys tech town campus at 300 taylor st both are scheduled for demolition the buildings are 75 to 80 years old and have concrete walls and floors and wooden roofs
4624216 we think you need to be reminded not to do obviously wrong stuff
4624217 well theres at least one person at iowa who did something that was obviously wrong shouldnt something be done about it
4624218 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4624219 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4624220 bugliosi the lawyer whose biggest claim to fame is prosecuting

4624222 people who eat several fast food meals a week are significantly heavier than those who dont eat fast food very often according to a study presented to the annual meeting of the obesity society
4624223 yes officer i was driving with a live donkey strapped to the roof and used my undies as an antenna flag because
4624224 its clear they clinton and gore have a message that wants to that they want to have come out of this convention its a mainstream message and i think a little toughness is in order
4624225 its a matter of timing and giving everybody equal opportunity what would you do if you say to one person on your issue and you didnt come before any of the committees ahead of time you get up and were going to allow you to make a five minute speech then how are you going to turn down any of the hundreds of people that might want to get up and make a speech and its just a practical matter it really isnt a big deal
4624226 the convention schedule is set the democrats of the country have spoken as to the direction they want the country to go
4624227 its going to do a take a lot to repair the damage there i think so they could have treated casey better but dont underestimate the democrats are not going to try to fudge it on this issue youve got to be choice on this issue
4624228 theres a process we went through the process governor casey had a full hearing the majority of the democrats didnt buy his position i respect him very much but there is no slight to governor casey

4624231 if i put in three or four eighteen hour twenty hour days in a row then im not sharp its just a fact i can be sharp if i get a little more rest
4624232 its the middle class that will ultimately shoulder this fiscal burden in terms of higher taxes and lower growth
4624233 39 6 percent personal income tax a 52 2 percent combined income and payroll tax a 28 percent capital gains tax a 39 6 percent dividends tax and a 55 percent estate tax
4624234 sen barack obama d ill on friday announced an emergency economic plan that would give families a stimulus check of 1 000 each funded in part by what his presidential campaign calls windfall profits from big oil separately obamas plan includes a 50 billion stimulus package
4624235 t he windfall profits tax was forecasted to raise more than 320 billion between 1980 and 1989 however according to the crs the government collected only 80 billion in gross tax revenue 146 billion in 2004 dollars the net amount was actually less than this roughly 40 billion because the tax was deductible against corporate income
4624236 crs also found the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 percent to 6 percent thereby increasing american dependence on foreign oil sources by 8 percent to 16 percent a side effect was declining not increasing tax collections figure 1 clearly shows that while the tax raised considerable revenue in the initial years following its enactment those revenues declined to almost nothing as the domestic industry collapsed
4624237 barack obama is the only candidate who has a real middle class relief plan he will provide 1 000 in a refundable tax credit to working families create a universal mortgage interest credit for homeowners who cant benefit from a mortgage tax incentive available to wealthier americans and create a 4 000 college tax credit for middle class families
4624238 obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than 50 000 per year this will provide an immediate tax cut averaging 1 400 to 7 million seniors and relieve millions from the burden of filing tax returns
4624239 im bill clinton and i believe that you deserve more than 30 second ads and vague promises thats why ive offered a comprehensive plan to get our economy moving again to take care of our own people and regain our economic leadership it starts with a tax cut for the middle class and asks the rich to pay their fair share
4624240 and the bush tax cuts people didnt need them and they werent even asking for them and thats why they need to be less so that we can pay for universal health care and other initiatives
4624241 w e know that at a time of war and economic hardship the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for americans who dont need them and werent even asking for them
4624242 this amounts to a tax of over 2 000 on each man woman and child in the united states the foreign aid budget now stands at 300 billion the act would add the additional expenditure to the already huge amount allocated to assist the world
4624243 tax on the rental value of land and natural resources
4624244 fees for the commercial use of the oceans fees for airplane use of the skies fees for the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and a tax on the carbon content of fuels
4624245 working with the vendors from the 2003 to resolve the debt the fact that kennedy communications did work last year for a campaign that amy was involved is a sign of that resolution being worked on
4624246 i am a bargirl that is why you can not trust me
4624247 who would shower her with 15000 pesos just for her to give him a lapdance with the clothings on
4624248 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4624249 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4624250 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4624251 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4624252 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4624253 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4624254 gerrit cole is not going to sign with us its as simple as that
4624255 unfortunately he wants to pursue college and he does not have an interest in pursuing professional baseball its not a money negotiating issue as much as a life choice at this moment in time
4624256 we knew when we selected gerrit cole that there was a signability issue
4624257 to be truthful that signability issue spoke more to the difficulty in negotiation not his interest level being college versus pro at the time that we selected him his interest was to play professionally although he had a choice to go to college
4624258 obviously between drafting him and aug 15th after a lot of thought the family and the player made a life choice that they want to forego professional baseball for now
4624259 we wished we could have signed him we wished we could have negotiated with him
4624260 my stance and preference from draft day has been to sign with the yankees i am simply awaiting to find out from them if they wish to sign me
4624261 the only reason returning to school has even been discussed is simply if the yankees do not make me an offer
4624262 we wanted to create with this campaign and now this dvd real life realistic scenarios that viewers could relate to
4624263 we spent months editing the dvd with the berwyn team pulling from all the additional footage we had from the shoot
4624264 we wanted to put as much content on the dvd as possible the berwyn team was great to work with they really understood exactly what we were trying to do from the start and were behind it completely
4624265 us to participate in something outside of the realm of traditional advertising to create compelling content from outs basically but the
4624266 i looked for material that made us laugh and there were so many great segments that could not be used in the for air spots but were perfect for the dvd
4624267 we believe weve set a new standard for the advertising projects we shoot which delivers content to our consumer beyond the 30 second commercial
4624268 we are definitely going to approach shooting in a whole new way and believe that this is where the business is headed
4624269 we want to provide as many entertaining and informative avenues for the viewer to interact with the brand while giving advertisers more opportunities to share their messages with their customers
4624270 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
4624271 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4624272 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4624273 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4624274 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4624275 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4624276 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4624277 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4624278 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
4624279 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
4624280 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
4624281 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
4624282 if someone puts defamatory messages on a web site then there are likely grounds for legal action but a site just airing customer grievances may not be worth the hassle expense and embarrassment of legal action it might only encourage the owner

4624334 you need to rush me to the hospital because mom stabbed me with a knife i am bleeding to death
4624335 it is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation the higher it is the harder it is flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard he is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months
4624336 youre a pitcher youre always going to feel something but theres a difference between its not right and thats just the normal everyday stuff it was actually pretty good today the first couple of throws you get everything out and then it loosens up for you as of right now it feels pretty good
4624337 someone tell me what the thought process is of having molina bat after gardner it negates his speed pitchers will throw over to 1st 100 time if he gets on and molina is up to bat i can not figure this out someone help me understand why you bat molina after gardner
4624338 somehow i imagine cano standing outside his apartment with a blank stare not knowing how to get to yankee stadium when melky doesnt come pick him up
4624339 i imagine cano standing outside his apartment with a blank stare
4624340 somehow i imagine cano standing outside his apartment with a blank stare not knowing how to get to yankee stadium when melky doesnt come pick him up i can only imagine him trying to decipher a subway map hope cash got him car service for the rest of the season
4624341 they always drove to the park together and ate together on the road pete did a good article about the pair a week or so ago with some good quotes from a rod
4624342 i can not figure this out someone help me understand why you bat molina after gardner
4624343 laura i am so betting on robby being better without melky i bet we see a crisp little soldier at 2b tonight in the form of one robby cano
4624344 the reast of the team hates melky and loves brett
4624345 why would opposing players like him brett can hit anybody
4624346 why release sexson if nothing else he is a solid defensive replacement at 1b who does that now
4624347 if i were kcs pitcher i wouldnt throw any strikes to nady
4624348 seeing melky get optioned reminds me of about the same point in the season in 96 when the yankees broke up the similarly chummy williamses gerald amp bernie they were very close and i remember feeling kind of bad for both of them it could be argued however that this separation was a marker in bernies maturation as a player at no point before 96 did he hit more than 20 hrs 100 rbi
4624349 i can only imagine him trying to decipher a subway map
4624350 fwiw pettittes and meches numbers this year are pretty identical
4624351 why would opposing players like him brett can hit anybody he hit off papelbon lets see melky hit off of papelbon
4624352 fwiw pettittes and meches numbers this year are pretty identical
4624353 larry bowa was on his show interestingly larry bowa said he never wanted to leave the yankees and if girardi asked him he would have stayed as 3rd base coach he was told by yankee officials that they were gonna make a complete overhaul
4624354 girardi expects gardner to get the majority of starts in cf with giambi playing more 1b and damon dh
4624355 after giving every indication to team officials prior to the draft that he wanted to be a yankee cole seems to have his heart set on attending ucla he hasnt even let the yankees present him an offer
4624356 so there was just a tornado warning in north jersey
4624357 trevor august 15th 2008 at 5 26 pm im sorry but im not rooting for gerrit cole i wish him the worse let him tear some arm ligament and have major shoulder surgery with his bad mechanics for all i care
4624358 i am stunned to hear people calling bobby the worst defensive of on the team i think you are really not thinking hard if you say that you want to trot out everyones numbers feel free to do so thanks
4624359 tricia who is a worse outfielder on the team than abreu
4624360 why would opposing players like him brett can hit anybody he hit off papelbon lets see melky hit off of papelbon
4624361 odd to see cole going to ucla they have a terrible stadium and poor baseball athletic facilities their manager is not known as a solid baseball guy i guess it is for the beach and babes because it is certainly not for the baseball program if he wanted warm weather and beaches and a good baseball program there are much better options available
4624362 id trade him for lastings milledge give me the piece ill pull the trigger
4624363 exactly what is there to like about ian kennedy hes shown nothing on the field and even less off of it
4624364 supposedly derek jeter was in the clubhouse talking animatedly to cano maybe jeters stepping up and getting a little more vocal
4624365 seriously has milledges stock fallen or improved since he was traded for ryan church
4624366 sources inside the clubhouse say that jeter looked as animated as he has all year as he stood alone with cano who in turn seemed grim but alert as his captain spoke cano nodded several times but said little as jeter made several odd gestures
4624367 pete youve posted some real winners today first going after russo in a bad way now you have mindless comments on ucla im a graduate student in mathematics do some research you know what you accused russo of never doing ucla has an elite mathematics department in fact probably better than harvards and even has perhaps the top mathematician in the world in terence tao id bet the other academic departments are top notch as well nice try thats a bad job
4624368 supposedly derek jeter was in the clubhouse talking animatedly to cano maybe jeters stepping up and getting a little more vocal
4624369 can we all agree that ucla is a fine institution and can we also agree that usc has historically been the better baseball program
4624370 ucla guys relax im not a hater love ucla basketball
4624371 would it be too much to ask that the posters who want coles arm to fall off have their fingers fall off is that really to much to ask the amount of idiots posting get worse and worse every day
4624372 eventually ill backtrack and read petes posts but for right now is there a cliffs notes version
4624373 if this works cash can name his price even more so than he already can
4624374 i hope you are all well and no ones fallen from the ledge yet
4624375 folks i will miss the first half of the game
4624376 when you take the field tonight i want you to look out to center field and then look into that dug out and take a hard inventory of what is missing then remove your head from your ass cause you are next bitch
4624377 i have been on vacation for the last 10 days what happened to my yankees
4624378 well i hope jeter was more eloquent then that still cano sucks
4624379 cabrera was sent down to triple a scranton wilkes barre to work on hitting bunting and baserunning among other things
4624380 you shouldnt want to be any other place at this time

4624383 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4624384 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4624385 we thought well this is the worse that it can be
4624386 okay let it come were okay with it and it wasnt
4624387 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
4624388 we just thought it was a great opportunity he expects to do this for a year take a deep breath and decide what to do next year by no means does this mean were saying goodbye to the nba

4624426 the u s capital markets present a tremendous opportunity for emerging chinese companies as they work to grow their businesses
4624427 chardans management team has recognized and facilitated this avenue of growth having successfully brought three chinese companies to market in the u s
4624428 we believe that by listing on nasdaq acquisition companies demonstrate their commitment to investors by embracing our marketplaces more stringent listing standards for this growing market segment
4624429 all we have to do is to agree on several minor issues
4624430 as players we realise this is the next step for us last season was a big disappointment in the league spurs finished 11th but we know we are better than that
4624431 we feel with the players we have got now there is no reason why we cant break into the top four and deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont
4624432 i watched him against england at wembley when croatia won 3 2 and he impressed me since he has come in he has shown us his quality again and i am sure he will be a great addition to the squad
4624433 he is similar to david beckham with his right foot and has already made a difference to us in pre season
4624434 as captain i felt a particular duty to be out there as often as possible when i couldnt that made it doubly hard
4624435 but ive got through that and can now concentrate on playing
4624436 i was injured when he ramos arrived and the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt at the time
4624437 but i was confident that when i came into the team i was going to do a good job and i feel i can do that again now
4624438 if i go into a season and i say for fucks sake if we dont win anything they the clubs star players will all leave i have already lost
4624439 the problem of the media is always to imagine the worst and the problem of the manager is always to imagine the best there is always a difference of thinking
4624440 i have money available to buy players but we go into the competition with the target to balance our budget which is what every manager should do
4624441 we have gone three or four years ago into a different policy
4624442 would i buy a player for 30m to win the title
4624443 when we bought emmanuel adebayor from monaco in january 2006 who was thinking he was a great player we bought him at what you can call a reasonable price it was 4 5m big signings reassure but good performances are much better
4624444 this team gave me fantastic excitement last year and i want to finish the job with them
4624445 we have made a lot of changes in a short space of time and i suppose it has been a shock for some
4624446 it will have been an eye opener now they understand how hard they have to work
4624447 it is about doing training at the right time and with the right intensity it is about making players able to cope with the demands of premier league weve given them a lot of different information
4624448 we are trying to get our group up to match fitness but it will take time and wont happen overnight
4624449 youve seen all the stuff in the papers and i havent got to say what the situation is
4624450 stephen has come back and said he had no intention of putting a transfer request in as for roque he has said he wants to stay it is silly because were preparing for a massive game against everton and some people seem to be creating so many issues at blackburn which arent there its not right and its not professional the players that i want to keep are not leaving this club its as simple as that
4624451 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4624452 but in this case barry i want to be very clear
4624453 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4624454 we continue working and we have time i have some players in mind
4624455 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level
4624456 since i have been here joey has been a model pro
4624457 he deserves another chance call it a last chance if you like but he deserves one
4624458 a draw is our second option we are going there to win
4624459 this is a good opportunity to show how good we are we have respect for rangers but we are not afraid of them
4624460 before anyone asks about mr romanov this was my decision
4624461 he has two teams i would be crazy not to use this situation where possible
4624462 i dont want too much harmony i want collisions and we need a killer instinct
4624463 everyone has tipped us to finish bottom or second bottom depending on how hull city do
4624464 and if im being honest i can understand why they see it that way the gulf between the championship and the premiership is so so big were going to need to bring in more players of greater quality just to have a chance but its going to be really difficult
4624465 this time last season nobody was tipping us to get promoted so now were here i suppose were even more unfashionable its only natural everyone expects us to be favourites for relegation
4624466 its something you have to deal with and hopefully you get through it well give it a bloody good go thats for sure and if people want to belittle us let them its the way the game has gone unfortunately people are very quick to knock you down but at the same time i know a lot of people are hoping that stoke and hull do well this season and buck the trend
4624467 our weakness has been that we havent got the expertise in the foreign market
4624468 plus theres a stigma attached to joining a club like stoke when i was a player if you werent in the team you would be knocking on the managers door saying well if i cant play here id like to play somewhere else but you get players these days who would rather stay at the so called name clubs even when they arent playing i dont understand that mentality but thats the way it is at this level we are bottom of the food chain
4624469 i was playing for bristol rovers and a lot of the other players sneered at me but i had a really bad ankle injury and i didnt want to be at home doing nothing i stayed with it and i would encourage any young player to do the same it opened my eyes
4624470 there are too many people coming out of school and heading into a life of nothing they go straight on the dole or into crime what needs to change
4624471 they should bring back national service it would give these young people something to strive towards i would never win an election being so old fashioned but thats the way i am i have old fashioned ways and im not ashamed to admit it because maybe thats what this country is missing at the moment
4624472 every time i take my teams abroad the players always behave
4624473 train with cannons rescued from local medieval ruins footballs are loaded into them and fired into the distance for mamady sidibe to head and ricardo fuller to run after
4624474 but when youve got players like ricardo and liam lawrence its disrespectful i try not to let it get on my nerves because if i started worrying about things i cant affect i could drive myself insane but these players are not up and under merchants
4624475 i had an issue with how the club was run and looking at them now ill leave others to decide who was right
4624476 he fired me for gross misconduct when there was no gross misconduct
4624477 it took 18 months to get to court and portsmouth settled on the steps it was difficult to take on milan because he is a wealthy powerful man but it was a matter of principle
4624478 we still have some way to go because rome wasnt built in a day but none of the clubs currently in the premier leagues top four were there from day one
4624479 they have all had their times away from it and efforts and sometimes failed efforts to get back in so that is the challenge for us
4624480 despite what you read in the press i dont think weve ever been closer than we are today
4624481 if we can get two or three more like him in then we can do this more quickly and get to where we want to be to try to get into the top four
4624482 we all understand our roles more now and what each of us brings to the club youre never going to get us to always agree but the important thing now is what we dont agree on stays in the room as far as im concerned were very much united
4624483 if you talk to mike you understand hes really committed to this club i think mike would be the first to tell you he doesnt understand everything about football hes a fan but hell learn very very quickly
4624484 hes very sharp very observant and doesnt miss a trick in meetings ive had him pick me up on things
4624485 but mikes stopped this talk about selling the club which was de stabilising weve just broken our transfer record for a defender and i dont think coloccini will be the last player in by a long way
4624486 milner is the last player newcastle are going to sell and the owner agrees
4624487 i remember having a conversation about the job with terry in a bar in london and he said the answer might be in front of you
4624488 wed had difficulties in the club in the changing room towards the end of the previous season which gareth had been really important in solving
4624489 i was speaking to other people but i always had gareth in mind and the more i thought about it and the more conversations i had with gareth the more i agreed with terry gareths a very intelligent lad and because of his intellect and ability to learn quickly i asked him to do something very different and difficult
4624490 so it was not difficult to support him at certain times but hes come through that and hes learnt tremendously hes learnt to cope with the pressure it was a huge immense responsibility for him to cope with everything and hes done that very very well
4624491 i understand the question but im not going to answer it
4624492 but coming straight from the dressing room to the managers chair who wouldnt have a period of self doubt its probably a strength to admit it but gareth had the quality to get out of it and he has
4624493 ive seen gareth as a player behind the scenes when things werent going well and hed get a situation by the throat and mould it to where he wanted it to be
4624494 he is a nice man but hes got a spine of steel i certainly wouldnt cross gareth too far
4624495 we had a discussion and gareth was content to let that player go
4624496 aston villa contacted me about two players the first one
4624497 sometimes you sell to buy other players there is a tipping point you ask
4624498 as hibernian did on many occasions at ibrox and celtic park we won football matches there against teams that were hugely bigger in size in quality of players in everything and yet we could go and win 3 0 at ibrox twice
4624499 it gives you hope to know that you could if you get it right on the day beat a team that youve got no right to and the players have got to believe that so we will go there believing we can do it if we do our jobs
4624500 theres always this debate in football about whether its about winning or whether its about entertaining and i think generally arsenal have got that balance right you could argue that arsenal have not won the premier league for a few years but is that a negative with chelsea spending millions and manchester united being there what i do know is arsenal dont spend hundreds of millions continue to play fantastic football and continue to be in the top four
4624501 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4624502 im not sure exactly what john terry said but with young players such as anderson wayne rooney cristiano ronaldo and nani the possibility for improvement is definitely there for us in fact i think thats the most natural thing you can say about our club these players have the capacity to improve and they will theres no doubt about that this team will win a lot more championships even long after ive gone thats the nature of the club there are good foundations to win more championships
4624503 when we won the world club championship in 1999 for some reason it seemed to be passed over but we are the only british team to have won it liverpool have never won it so i cannot understand why we did not get the praise or the publicity that we deserved to go halfway around the world and beat palmeiras the best team in south america at that time was a real achievement
4624504 thats not actually my target in life my target has already been achieved as far as liverpool are concerned in terms of ending their dominance
4624505 obviously you can never have too many strikers although i dont actually think we need to improve on too much from last season
4624506 we have to protect the dinosaurs a little bit more ryan giggs and paul scholes and gary neville but they are fit guys giggss endurance tests were the best in the club this summer which is unbelievable scholes and neville are much the same theres a lot of football left in them all plus im expecting a natural progression with the younger players
4624507 we are delighted with how he is doing and were pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4624508 improvement can come in a number of different ways for ronaldo
4624509 forty two goals is the target and it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent of the boy but you have to say its a big target for him what we will see is improvement in his authority and decision making

4624532 hes made a lot of strides and progress its not that sanders doesnt deserve it too but its just rhat he missed some time in the otas with a foot injury
4624533 from what ive been through getting this start means a lot to me
4624534 i cant even begin to tell you about the stress and tension ive felt the past two years it would take me a whole week to explain all of it
4624535 my rookie year just ate me up i thought i had made some strides going into last season but then came week 1 and it was starting the same way as 06 and it just continued
4624536 ive always been someone who realizes i represent my family and friends the people who know me and i felt like i was letting them down i never want to be a player who picks up a paycheck for doing nothing but thats what i was doing it was very humbling
4624537 every day i put what happened the day before the bad stuff behind me and tried to build on the good things i took it a day at a time
4624538 i look forward to keeping up the momentum ive got going from camp thus far

4624546 the activities during the 2006 election of the conservative party of canada in relation to certain election campaign expenses and ethical standards of public office holders
4624547 many canadians are not aware of the provision in the election act for candidates with 15 or more of the vote to receive previously 50 now 60 rebate for advertising expenses the conservative scheme of in and out funds recorded as local candidate expenses but spent in national campaign in violation of elections act ended up plumping up local expenditures enabling higher rebates it is difficult to understand why the devious conservative practice which undoubtedly contributed in some way to the election of a minority conservative government with 33 of the vote has not been given a higher profile in the media the conservative minority government has continuously acted not only as majority government but also as a party above scrutiny every voter in canada needs to watch the live coverage on cpac of the parliamentary ethics committees investigation into the conservative sponsorship nemesis there must be a full investigation into this misappropriation of funds for political gain
4624548 i am not satisfied that all the expenses claimed were of benefit to the candidate
4624549 she doesnt have a criminal record we need her there with us
4624550 for any person to recklessly leave a loaded unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any child under the age of 14
4624551 everything i see is her acting in their interests absolutely
4624552 shes really kind of helping them making sure they dont go down the road so many young athletes go down
4624553 she amazed me with how she was willing to devote herself to michaels interests she never got a penny as far as i know she didnt even get her expenses reimbursed
4624554 had a very good personal relationship they were very close he always hugged her
4624555 it has become clear to us that one of his people started saying things about mary that werent true but got mikes ear

4624585 hes shown a very good approach at the plate hes used the other side of the field very well hes been productive but hes been humble i think those two things are important the latter probably more so you have to understand your place

4624598 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4624599 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4624678 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
4624679 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
4624680 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4624681 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4624682 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
4624683 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
4624684 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory eyes on oil and the dollar
4624685 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets

4624689 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
4624690 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
4624691 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
4624692 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
4624693 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
4624694 the thing we need to look at is managing risk whether placing an investment on this versus that and whats the payoff of that investment
4624695 the conflict also threatens to poison russias relationship with europe and america for years to come can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply republican presidential candidate john mccain has been derided for his strong stance against mr putin including a proposal to kick russia out of the g 8 will his critics now admit that the man they called an antiquated cold warrior was right all along
4624696 the blood of those killed in this conflict is on the hands of radical nationalists thoughtless politicians opportunistic oligarchs and the leaders of the free world who value gas and oil more than principles more lives will be lost unless strong moral lines are drawn to reinforce the shattered lines of the map
4624697 freedoms light will never die here 1921 will never repeat here
4624698 i want my country to shine and go back on its feet like never before
4624699 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia
4624700 american credibility is very much at stake here if a true friend of the united states an ancient country already twice annexed by moscow in the past two centuries a democracy that has enthusiastically reached out to nato and the european union and even sent troops to fight in iraq can be snuffed out without concrete action by washington americas friendship will quickly lose its value and americas displeasure would matter even less the repercussions would be felt world wide from the capitals of new europe to jerusalem kabul and baghdad
4624701 my girlfriend does this thing i hate and im airing it on the internet because i can do that now

4624704 my friend the witchdoctor he told me what to say
4624705 the best thing we could find is a very patterned artifact one that its obvious humans made it
4624706 it would change the way we think about early humans in north america
4624707 in the lab you actually know what youre looking for finding it in the field is very cool even if its the smallest stone flake or bone fragment
4624708 we didnt know anything about how they may have spent their time while they werent traveling across the landscape thats been very elusive
4624709 were going to do what we can to disprove that
4624710 resided at the cusp of mythology and history but our results do seem to confirm the existence of a single early medieval progenitor to the most powerful and enduring irish dynasty
4624711 we used a genetic fingerprint in the y chromosome that was sufficiently detailed that you wouldnt expect very many men to have the same one
4624712 that part of ireland was influenced by a certain dynasty called u n ill descendants of niall a group of lineages that held sway to a greater or lesser degree for almost a thousand years
4624713 the area of this y chromosome coincides geographically with the greatest influence of these groups
4624714 irish surnames are typically based on people who are the eponymous ancestors
4624715 the chromosomes age was consistent with someone of nialls vintage about 1 700 years old
4624716 earlier irish customs were quite resistant to change divorce was allowed and concubines
4624717 it gives scientific support for medieval genealogies which i wouldnt necessarily have believed beforehand
4624718 theres nothing written about niall until hundreds of years after the time he would have lived so youre talking about a character who was almost arthurian
4624719 theres a sort of credibility train that i think many people including myself would have jumped off before you got to him
4624720 millions of men may be descended from irish king study says

4624767 the biggest issue with umd was the lack of creating for a targeted demo
4624768 when we first launched it was a difficult sale i dont think its a big stretch to say that a 16 year old doesnt have a lot of discretionary income we were offering umds that were more expensive than dvds at the time and we want content that is in line with what the demo is asking for action and comedy not romantic dramas

4624771 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4624772 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4624773 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4624774 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing

4624777 cum poti tarai un batran de 80 de ani la mare cand el se sufoca si in agentia de voiaj cu tot cu aerul conditionat de aici
4624778 e destul de aiurea sa mergi in vacanta cu un copil si cu prietena si inca cineva nici nu poti urca pe munte nici nu poti bea nici sa stai noaptea tarziu te cam limiteaza plozii mai ales daca copilul nu e al tau cine naiba ar chema adulti in vacanta cu el si mai ales cum ar putea un student sa aiba o prietena care nu e nici studenta nici eleva poate ca merge cu vreo ruda oricum fetita e ruda lui poate merge cu parintii lui daca fetita are acelasi nume cu el atunci e vorba de fetita fratelui lui seamana au acelasi nume si probabil cu sotia fratelui de obicei in caz de partaj mamicile iau copii si nu prea pare situatie de divort din tristetea lui sorin e clar ca merge singur cu oamenii astia cu care nu are cine stie ce contact
4624779 cred ca e cu uncap mai inalt decat mine si e asa simpatic imi plac oamenii organizati

4624786 the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
4624787 irish epic contains many episodes of the struggle between the children of domnu representing darkness and evil and the children of danu representing light and good
4624788 as far as i can tell there are lots of asses documented at the indus settlements but not domestic horses
4624789 there is every ground to assume the dissemination from it of metal works celts daggers
4624790 well you can say from this that the indus civilization itself is aryan and the dravidian hypothesis is wrong i do not believe that is the correct answer we do not have the horse in the indus civilization there is no evidence for the wheeled chariot there is no evidence for the spoked wheels the rgveda the earliest document of the indo aryans has no mention of great cities like harappa or mohenjaro daro so the only other possibility is that a some like cult based on some kind of hallucinogenic drug crushed and filtered out of a plant and drunk ritually must have existed in harappa and that it was taken over by the indo iranians and the incoming aryans
4624791 the name sarasvati is an aryan proto indo iranian saras vnt t meaning
4624792 the early harappans seem to have been involved in the minerals and metals economy
4624793 there is overwhelming evidence of maritime trade by the archaeological evidence and discoveries of the so called harappan civilization which can now be re christened sarasvati sindhu civilization
4624794 the vedas is a pre chalcolithic culture it does not speak of any urban centres it certainly does not speak of any settlements which have the characteristics of harappan cities for example there is no reference to citadel areas and residential areas there is no reference to drainage systems or to streets or to granaries or warehouses or to a public bath or to a sophisticated exchange system or weights and measures on a graduated scale which was known as and described to me there are the essential characteristics or harappan urbanization and all these characteristics are absent in the vedas you may have people saying oh
4624795 the early harappans seem to have been involved in the minerals and metals economy
4624796 that the aryans were horse riding used chariots for transports and since no signs of horse was found at the sites of harappa and mohenjo daro the inhabitants of the indus valley cannot be aryans
4624797 horses are prominent in the traditions of every known branch of the ancient indo europeans
4624798 but according to the first archaeological surveys there had been no horses in the harappan cities by contrast plenty of horse remains have been found in the ukraine and south russia including bridle scarred horse teeth dated to 4300 bc is that not proof enough that horses are a foreign import into india and that the momentous step of horse demestication was taken far outside india even if there had not existed any horses in harappan india it would still be conceivable that the indians had domesticated the horse outside india the idea of domestication may have been brought to the horse rich steppes from a more advanced area where donkeys and oxen were already being used as beasts of burden or even to pull carts
4624799 where is the evidence of the mother land of this grand aryan civilization that you claim suppossedly came from outside of india
4624800 you cant rule india as long as they are hindus
4624801 the indus square is symbolic and as small as possible with 3 x 3 smaller squares the scandinavian square has normally 14 x 14 squares the golden plate from stonehenge has 9 x 9 triangles and the indus square at centre astronomers have checked that it could be use for deciding the important calendar events of the year the sun square symbolises the sun year with the month wheel in centre normally they were interested in the moon year since the water ritual followed that maybe the small squares symbolise 8 animals of their animal round i have not yet found an image with them all so my conclusions come from analysing the seals three of a kind symbolises the noun and the wavy line water it could be the water god but in this case it is the heavenly flood watergate one end is at sagittarius and the birds fly above it aquila swan and owl lyre again we get a little help from egypt where we find the same symbolism sometimes there is an eagle in the small corner square that corner of square symbolises ramadan this symbol is then some other corner and that seems to be the symbol for leek or leak the beginning of growth we find something like this in egypt symbolising the four pillars carrying heaven i e the cardinal directions this figure shows that the pillars belong to the same whole in scandinavia they are standing freely but surely it has been some kind of practical arrangement with pillars for deciding the directions when watching the stars later when they got used they needed only one stable alignment as for instance the vi that was in use until 18th century in a few places in denmark if you have a parted year you need two symbols for symbolising that in scandinavian symbolism they draw the second half with double lines or double the symbols generally they were only interested in the season the first symbol creates a link to the u shapes symbols we see them with 2 or 3 strokes that establishes three of them and maybe they symbolises periods we must note that the symbols have been made in at least two
4624802 on fastracs behalf we are very excited to be able to get ethanol locally the ethanol fastrac has been using has been coming from the midwest
4624803 the ethanol were producing today is predominately from local corn the other thing is this plan as part of the process is that well produce we distillers grains and dry distillers grains very high quality enriched animal feed that can be used by dairy beef cattle predominately in this area
4624804 the phone apparently a hot item to show off in googles cafeterias these days is big and bulky and not as sleek as the iphone and android while extremely powerful has a less elegant less user friendly interface than the iphone
4624805 does this mean it wont sell well of course not theres a lot more variables like device and contract pricing software and services etc that will help determine its commercial success
4624806 the place was going to be filled with tourists and the prices are 5x what they normally are he said
4624807 a 60 a night hotel is going for about 250 even a beer that is normally like 2 at the hotel bar was going for six bucks theyve gone up to western prices it was better to come back here and do some work
4624808 by not being part of the crowd here we do get looked at a bit differently by companies outside of this area
4624809 it allows us to take advantage of the fact that many of the vcs here will look locally but not necessarily look farther afield we do see tremendous opportunity all the way up and down the west coast from bc down to san diego
4624810 wow i cant believe we have been playing blackjack for 10 hours straight while drinking crown and coke what time is it 3 30 in the morning lets wake rex up and call him an asshole no wait lets pay that hooker over there to call rex and tell him that shes pregnant with his kid

4624817 they told me that they didnt see my life in danger so they turned me down
4624818 i want to make a difference for the refugees in greece if im rejected what about others ive paid thousands to keep this case going no ordinary refugee can afford to do that i hope i lose so i can take it to the european court there i can effect change in the way greece and even europe treats refugees

4624821 esta absoluta informalidad comunica a cada instante que lo importante no son las formas sino el fondo
4624822 theres a tremendous amount of infrastructure need and renovating from floor to floor to meet classroom or other university type needs is probably prohibitive
4624823 so the bottom line is that at the present time i will not be pursuing any further possibility of the toledo being involved in this building
4624824 the building itself probably would require much too much renovation to meet our needs for any of our current space requirements at the university of toledo and that statement includes the consideration of the law school
4624825 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4624826 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4624827 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4624828 much needed investment in the uks oil and gas reserves
4624829 the evidence strongly suggests that there is next to no chance of people in sunderland having the same opportunities as the people of birmingham or portsmouth
4624830 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland
4624831 it is derived from the old english cirm and meant the blended tinkling sounds produced by a small flock
4624832 oh no ill put it on the garden they grow lovely tomatoes
4624833 we had live electric lines on the ground here that were popping explosions in the garage itself and just a heavy volume of fire coming out of there
4624834 ive always been big on hunting and i just want to get that big deer
4624835 the state had actually been pushing for this for a long time simply because they can sell more licenses in 1983 there were 800 000 hunting licenses sold and this year they sold less than 500 000
4624836 we carry one weapon between the two of us always within arms reach in new york state i think its a long time coming to be honest
4624837 if you dont teach a kid a certain thing by 13 14 years old youre going to lose him so what this does is foster a relationship between a beginning hunter and a mentor
4624838 she was a great athlete just ability you know as soon as somebody has the ability to start doing something it makes people around other members of the team or squad start to go well if she can do it i can do it so they start working harder to try to obtain what that persons doing
4624839 whitebait are the young of native fish such as giant kokopu shortjaw kokopu banded kokopu koaro and inanga collectively known as galaxiids
4624840 our greatest concern was that we have all been checking streams and rivers with historical records of having adult galaxiids and not been able to find them
4624841 the public and the city really dont know exactly whats going on about about 10 percent of the city is right under the wind farm
4624842 it puts the affected parties on the back foot he said
4624843 make sure i pay you back i dont want to take any pocket money
4624844 to be successful in business you have to work really hard
4624845 the single thing you cant do without is a good education

4624847 what did you want to be when you grew up
4624848 when i was about 10 or 11 i wanted to be prime minister ill let you know how that goes in a few months
4624849 there are so many people here and overseas that work desperately hard in their jobs and its always a shame when you have one or two people who let us down
4624850 we have pretty strict rules and regulations about the consumption and supply of alcohol to underage personnel and we obviously dont condone it
4624851 we take our host responsibility very seriously and our approach to alcohol extremely seriously
4624852 we do have clubs and social amenities on our bases socialisation is an important part of army life
4624853 we have had a fantastic summer at the library we had a really good summer reading program had a great response with kids reading and coming to our weekly programs this is just kinda like the icing on the cake
4624854 the biggest thing right now thats affecting the post office is the cost of gas the post office has the largest private fleet of vehicles in the country so if gas goes up one penny a gallon its an additional 8 million a year cost for the postal service said postmaster greg stiner
4624855 if were not as busy on the retail counter here on the building not only does it help cut costs for us but it helps to cut the lines down so customers dont have to come and stand in line
4624856 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4624857 what better way than to help the countries where the people are to improve their lives so that the people dont have to leave
4624858 the bsx is delighted to have joined and been accepted to membership of this prestigious group of industry professional that are committed to ensuring that the european securitisation markets evolve in a fashion that speaks to the current challenges being experienced generally in the securitisation markets globally and which promotes industry standards that provide additional disclosure thus making this segment of the global capital market more transparent
4624859 the bsx made the decision to join the esf after experiencing an increased level of interest in the listing of securitised products following its designation as a recognised stock exchange by the uks hm revenue and customs he noted that queries were being fielded from european product originators and their service providers the bsx welcomed the invitation to join the esf as it felt that being a member would provide the exchange with a strong link and information flow to keep abreast of important changes occurring in this industry sector it also gives the exchange a gateway through which to provide input to the esf membership on its experiences in the securitisation segment of the capital market
4624860 the french are so preoccupied with etiquette they never learn manners

4624863 teaching students today is not like teaching them twenty years ago they are able to see the need to make learning relevant to their lives to have a little fun with their classrooms

4624867 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4624868 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4624869 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement
4624870 hell as long as im supposed to be experimenting and figuring out how to be an adult i may as well try various quality booze instead of just going for quantity

4624882 the indictments didnt come so they released the affidavit and let people know where to find this affidavit
4624883 as i believe i have said everyone in prison is an innocent man oh they read the scripture the way those holy rollers on tv read the book of revelations they were the victims of judges with hearts of stone and balls to match or incompetent lawyers or police frame ups or bad luck they read the scripture but you can see a different scripture in their faces most cons are a low sort no good to themselves or anyone else and their worst luck was that their mothers carried them to term
4624884 this case provides a tremendous amount of satisfaction to our staff as we are able to provide funds to hundreds of thousands of harmed investors
4624885 we look forward to completing the full distribution in the coming months
4624886 we are very pleased to begin distributing money in the fair fund to janus investors harmed by market timing misconduct this distribution is another example of the commissions ongoing commitment to return money to injured investors
4624887 brain cells come and brain cells go but fat cells live forever
4624888 he never showed no signs of being sick nothing hurting him and we were so close it was crazy
4624889 it was a blessing to be his mama the people that loved and cared for him the way he touched people
4624890 we talked to him asked him about lifting weights and so on he said hed been lifting weights its hard he looked very normal he looked very healthy and there was no indication that there were any kind of problems
4624891 its not only a loss for me its a loss for everybody
4624892 the writers strike was going on it wasnt that bad
4624893 why should two people who have been friends in the past and have the ability to freeze time and thus literally all the time in the world to discuss and explain things need to come to blows
4624894 how the devil would someone with the ability to regenerate know that doing x would result in his permanent demise
4624895 why is this person doing these stupid and out of character things other than someones desperate need for the plot to move in a particular direction
4624896 fantacy hole they had frickin small holes in the wall use your imagination im not sayin it lol there was a local preacher man that just happen to be in there at the time of the bust
4624897 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4624898 we are in the final stages of tying everything up with edu but we still have to apply for the work pemit he is only 22 and has played the last number of internationals so id hope we wil get him all right
4624899 the thunderstorm with rotation has moved out of the warned area
4624900 in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
4624901 ive got to say that a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again
4624902 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4624903 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4624904 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4624905 the key is whether the legislature has the right to inform the public of sex offenders living in the community
4624906 the intent of the legislature was not to provide punishment but to provide a civil remedial action
4624907 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4624908 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4624909 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4624910 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4624911 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4624912 based on the unanimous passage of this legislation through both chambers of the nevada legislature it would be hard to assume anyone foresaw the constitutional challenges the law is currently facing
4624913 still governor gibbons would much rather sign aggressive laws protecting the people of nevada from sexual predators than wait to see how other states handle federal legislation and see whether the courts agree with it
4624914 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4624915 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4624916 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4624917 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4624918 when they gathered in philadelphia in the summer of 1787 our nations founders sought to establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity today we the people must do all we can to create a more perfect union focused on the common good
4624919 now if you knew for sure 100 that you were having a boy which one would you like better
4624920 ummm well i like the blue one but thats just me
4624921 yeah but thats just me maybe you should go with your gut
4624922 every time we make a decision to get oil reserves from the middle east we are making a financial decision so lets not stop at 35 miles per gallon lets go to 100 to do so youre going to have to go massively electric but from my perspective as an automotive engineer we can do it we will have to stop burning fuel but you have to stop doing it without killing the economy
4624923 you can be a leader by adopting these types of standards
4624924 when i was in the governors office the discussion of solutions was narrow
4624925 i would come at problems from outside the box it got them thinking differently people were like can we really do that i could talk about issues openly the richness of the discussion was much greater much better and much more robust the strength was not that we were all the same it was that we were all different
4624926 it fits my background i can get the best from my resume and work experience in this job
4624927 in politics you put on the jersey of one team or the other
4624928 in the governors office we were all on the same team and if he hadnt given me that opportunity i wouldnt be doing this he did a lot to teach me about politics
4624929 its just that i have ideas that are different and that opens people up
4624930 with enough money behind them they can create a view in the electorate that isnt who i am
4624931 but i know who i am and i know about my morals ethics and business practices and i never thought id get to a point in my life where someone would actually spend money on a website about me and update it
4624932 a 30 second spot is 70 words how do i convey all of this in 70 words so i spend a lot of time out talking to people hoping they talk to their friends about me
4624933 almost every fair has called me asking if we have had problems with mike erickson
4624934 jeff merkelys party bosses are criticizing gordon smith and barack obama for voting for landmark legislation to invest in renewable energy and raise taxes on big oil
4624935 the oil executives who fill gordon smiths campaign coffers with cash have gotten huge tax breaks while average oregon families are left with higher prices at the pump
4624936 oregon families need help but gordon smith is busy helping big oil instead
4624937 almost every fair has called me asking if we have had problems with mike erickson
4624938 there will be cross pollination of all sorts on this dynamic triple bill tour what we know so far is that fab moretti will play drums for megapuss and greg rogove will play drums for little joy producer and guitarist noah georgeson will play guitar for both little joy amp megapuss as he also did on both of their albums expect the unexpected
4624939 im ready to make some money im good enough im smart enough and gosh darn it players like me
4624940 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
4624941 well i could be more effective and could do this if i had better working hours
4624942 the phone apparently a hot item to show off in googles cafeterias these days is big and bulky and not as sleek as the iphone and android while extremely powerful has a less elegant less user friendly interface than the iphone
4624943 does this mean it wont sell well of course not theres a lot more variables like device and contract pricing software and services etc that will help determine its commercial success
4624944 the place was going to be filled with tourists and the prices are 5x what they normally are he said
4624945 a 60 a night hotel is going for about 250 even a beer that is normally like 2 at the hotel bar was going for six bucks theyve gone up to western prices it was better to come back here and do some work
4624946 by not being part of the crowd here we do get looked at a bit differently by companies outside of this area
4624947 it allows us to take advantage of the fact that many of the vcs here will look locally but not necessarily look farther afield we do see tremendous opportunity all the way up and down the west coast from bc down to san diego
4624948 we will release a new luxury cabernet sauvignon from a new vineyard for us in the 2006 vintage
4624949 we havent named it yet but we are really looking forward to it the wine really kicks ass
4624950 why would i even think about celebrating beaujolais nouveau i wouldnt put that swill to my lips if you paid me
4624951 holy crap there is no way i am drinking something with those freaking dots over the u
4624952 we have stuff other countries just dont have we have grape varieties that are unique yet delicious too
4624953 if viognier and sauvignon blanc had a baby it would be gr ner veltliner
4624954 it makes everything from tingly little petite chablis to great whomping montrachet and nobody kvetches they cant get a handle on chardonnay gr ve does the same thing it can be as sleek as a mink or as big as babe the blue ox
4624955 i did everything in the vineyards and in the cellar and on the tractor
4624956 in times when many large international cellars are attempting to produce uniform wines which cater to the widest range of tastes possible moosbrugger is convinced that the future of wineries like schloss gobelsburg lies in individuality and character
4624957 as a high level of technology is necessary to warrant uniformity a maximum of individuality can only be achieved through a reduction of it
4624958 authentic personality from symbiosis between the trees that are grown under the same climatic conditions as the resulting grapes
4624959 if the montes story reads like a dream it is because it started as one and progressively came true
4624960 we are always looking for quality it is our main aspiration
4624961 chile is totally isolated from the rest of the world by natural barriers in the north is the driest desert in the world we have glaciers in the south in patagonia the andes are to the east they are very high mountains capped with snow and the pacific ocean to the west these are impossible to cross by insects
4624962 we can have a long growing season and allow the grapes to ripen slowly without risk of mold or botrytis to adversely affect the grapes because of the lack of rain i play the music and the plant dances
4624963 we were the first chilean winery to produce premium varietal wines the united states was the first market we focused on
4624964 we take every strange element that may come with the grapes leaves stems shoots and so on and we take that out so that the bottom line is that we have only quality fruit in the tank
4624965 an alvarinho of a new generation and an old memory
4624966 were probably going to stay away from him if possible
4624967 well see how he is after a few days off
4624968 my main project was bag in a box rhine riesling
4624969 except it didnt have a drop of riesling in it
4624970 my first real job came as assistant winemaker at simi i knew i didnt know how to make wine so i learned production management instead
4624971 when i started at chalk hill we were selling thin chardonnay to chain stores for 7 59 a bottle
4624972 working for a frenchman wasnt as much fun as being friends with a frenchman
4624973 we put 90 000 into ramey wine cellars the first two years to get the first wine out of the door the net from the first 260 cases was only 67 000
4624974 you mean where they shot the movie sideways ive had some pretty good pinots from there
4624975 santa barbara winery was making fruit wine today there are fifty to sixty wineries with thirty in the santa rita hills and santa ynez alone
4624976 the most important factor is the soil in the sta rita hills areas are sandy with a bit of clay but the best soil for cabernet is gravelly soil in los olivos we have quite a bit of gravelly spots
4624977 we are looking for more refined wines and we are doing much less oak than in the past
4624978 we used to use much more oak with the sauvignon blanc to achieve a bordeaux style but of course the fruit is a little riper here than it is in bordeaux and now we are going away from using the oak in the sauvignon blanc to accentuate the fruit but for the cabs we use all french oak for more tradition and to bring out the best qualities in the wine
4624979 balance is super important concentration is super important you can have powerful wines that are still balanced due to the concentration some would say that with sauvignon blanc 13 alcohol is a good threshold but if you have the concentration the levels can be higher if it is balanced
4624980 it was kind of a wrestling move a front headlock used as a choke i squeezed like hell but i didnt know what i was doing
4624981 hes not ready for a relationship or he is too immature for you or she calls him bad names and discourages me from talking to him she suggests that i wait until the fall semester begins to start trying to reach out to him en espa ol
4624982 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4624983 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4624984 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4624985 re ne poemas e pequenas cr nicas do inigual vel mario quintana
4624986 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4624987 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4624988 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
4624989 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4624990 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4624991 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4624992 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4624993 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4624994 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4624995 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4624996 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4624997 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4624998 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4624999 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4625000 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4625001 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4625002 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4625003 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of if they somehow enable them
4625004 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4625005 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4625006 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4625007 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4625008 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4625009 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4625010 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4625011 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4625012 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4625013 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4625014 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4625015 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4625016 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4625017 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4625018 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4625019 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4625020 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4625021 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4625022 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4625023 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4625024 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4625025 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4625026 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4625027 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4625028 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4625029 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4625030 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4625031 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4625032 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4625033 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4625034 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4625035 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4625036 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4625037 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4625038 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4625039 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4625040 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4625041 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4625042 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4625043 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4625044 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4625045 its so awesome it gets three smileys in a row how awesome is that lol hehe
4625046 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4625047 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4625048 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4625049 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4625050 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4625051 ive called you all here because you are all suspects in the murder case of henry flare he was found dead in his home last night when his wife came home
4625052 mr streven you are the manager of the burger king where henry had dinner last night correct

4625056 yes yes and how exactly has he been has he ever shown up late to work once more than once i hear he started a rumor that you were making ahem questionable business deals if i were you i wouldnt much like that rumor especially if that rumor was true
4625057 a happy 4 years an awful 4 years i hear that henry was very fond of you so fond that it would have broken his heart if you divorced too bad you had to make it stop
4625058 oh sorry sorry im jumping to conclusions or am i

4625067 we came out this morning real spirited we had a little bit of a break yesterday didnt go as long in the afternoon and came out this morning and did a lot of team work i love the tempo i really do i think our defense really turned it up a little bit this morning and i think that carried into our team period this afternoon we are to a point in this camp where i know guys have bumps and bruises i know theyre tired but they know they have to just go and do their job regardless of what happens we have to go play the next play
4625068 the u s this year will have spent 100 billion on contractors in iraq since the invasion in 2003 a milestone that reflects the bush administrations unprecedented level of dependence on private firms for help in the war according to a government report one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the u s military and other government agencies in a war zone where employees of private contractors now outnumber american troops
4625069 most u s corporations pay no federal income taxes and most foreign companies that do business in the united states arent paying corporate taxes

4625071 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
4625072 the bush administration yesterday monday proposed a regulatory overhaul of the endangered species act to allow federal agencies to decide whether protected species would be imperiled by agency projects eliminating the independent scientific reviews that have been required by law for more than three decades
4625073 interior secretary dirk kempthorne described the new rules as a narrow regulatory change that will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act

4625075 ive called you all here because you are all suspects in the murder case of henry flare he was found dead in his home last night when his wife came home

4625083 we were building up a pyramid the girls had to run up jump on the trampoline vault and then flip onto the top of the pyramid
4625084 when madonna did her little flip and got up there it turned out she had nude tights on and it looked like she wasnt wearing anything under her skirt i was shocked at first and the basketball coach was really upset
4625085 she used to come into our office before class wed put on the music and make her dance and entertain us as well as everyone else in the locker room
4625086 madonna was a determined grade a student i dont want to say she was a nerdy kid but she was more along that sort of line than a trouble maker
4625087 peron said that by now hopefully madonna has realised that her daughter lourdes is a reincarnated evita peron
4625088 it seems that madonna spent so much time at evitas grave doing research for her film role as evita that evita herself took over madonnas body during filming
4625089 those among us who are sensitive to this kind of thing can actually see eva peron going into madonnas body when she sings dont cry for me argentina in the balcony scene evita chose madonna as a mother figure and became lourdes
4625090 madonna fell pregnant with lourdes while she was making the film
4625091 writing producing and directing will be the best career path for madonna in the future shell succeed with this
4625092 she madonna wanted it for a while but she couldnt bring herself to spend that much money on a watch
4625093 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4625094 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4625095 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4625096 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4625097 and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4625098 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4625099 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4625100 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4625101 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4625102 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4625103 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4625104 in dynamo each storage node has three main software components request coordination membership and failure detection and a local persistence engine all these components are implemented in java
4625105 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4625106 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4625107 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4625108 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4625109 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4625110 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4625111 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4625112 who are open to doing something on the production side
4625113 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4625114 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4625115 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4625116 my dad listened to this shit i remember he once whipped me to bye bye love by the everly brothers after i took a dump on the living room floor i must have been about three still good shit when yr drunk
4625117 not long you wanted a new trick kid hows this man walks on air
4625118 it was a good tackle by devin just the way he hit me i thought it was pretty wrong at the time i just reacted wrong in a real game situation that would never happen
4625119 i look back at it and say it was stupid real stupid
4625120 for one hes my teammate for two i have a lot of self control and i didnt have it there
4625121 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4625122 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4625123 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4625124 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

4625126 we have looked at partners for a lot of things and we are going to continue to do that for the best business model
4625127 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4625128 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4625129 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4625130 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4625131 please upload a video only if you created it or participated closely in its creation no tv shows or footage you found on the web
4625132 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4625133 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4625134 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4625135 if everyone panics from day one the price will go down said mark topy of patersons securities the only broker covering city pacific
4625136 if youre a little more patient there could be some upside he said
4625137 we understand that many of our unit holders are relying on these distribution payments in what has been a challenging year mr sullivan said
4625138 the board must ensure that the value of the funds assets are preserved
4625139 a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4625140 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4625141 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4625142 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4625143 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4625144 she has delved into hinduism in the past but i fear hers was a hurried glimpse into the vast sea of knowledge hinduism offers
4625145 hinduism consists of a rich and long tradition of philosophical thought dating back to about 3 000 bc which requires a wholehearted study and devotion
4625146 while wishing her all the best on her 50th birthday we would encourage madonna to undertake a serious study of hinduism its scriptures its schools of philosophy doctrines and practices
4625147 we would be willing to provide her with all the help answer her queries and guide her on her journey to explore hinduism and its concepts
4625148 working with her is an endless experimentation to gain a perfect result shes very demanding but weve learned so much from her
4625149 she is fashion her styles are always inspiring i liked the early looks but shes even better now her personality her unique strength and will that is stronger than just one look she is beyond looks she is madonna
4625150 shes the essence of the american dream professionalism obsession and ambition
4625151 proceeding with the pulp mill strengthens the underlying business adds demonstrable value that should lead to market upgrades and a positive share price re rating
4625152 to the families i am so sorry we did not bring your loved ones home
4625153 to the public keep these firefighters in your prayers the fire season has a way to go even as we are sitting here today there are battles raging in the forest
4625154 i know in my heart all his friends who died with him were living their prayer
4625155 but for the way they had lived they were pretty jazzed and happy because they held the lines and they loved helicopter rides
4625156 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in you lives
4625157 perhaps their gift will be saving the life of a future firefighter or helicopter pilot
4625158 aunt mary gave me that lamp and i dont want to hurt her feelings
4625159 im saving the in case one of my kids want it
4625160 geopolitical concerns and the realisation that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4625161 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
4625162 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
4625163 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
4625164 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
4625165 madonna is at the end of a 30 year cycle in her life a true maturing is happening now
4625166 going forward she may grow into playing the role of grand dame of the music industry over the next two years well see another face another reinvention of herself that we have not yet witnessed in the past
4625167 she does best in the city of los angeles but in london she shines in a regal way new york is a more stressful city in that saturn is stronger there causing her to feel pressured to work harder
4625168 she should be careful of her health during this two year period as neptune transiting her house of health can possibly bring a health crisis
4625169 its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits
4625170 an eclipse on her sun does indicate a big year ahead for her possibly major shifts in her relationship with her husband and the role he plays in her life
4625171 eclipses come in cycles the last time madonna experienced this particular eclipse cycle was when she met and became involved with her current husband guy ritchie the cycle before that one was when she and her first husband sean penn got divorced so her marriage may experience some challenges now
4625172 as saturn moves over her moon later this autumn 08 there are usually some changes in the home this could be a move an additional home adopting another child or perhaps one of her children such as her daughter lourdes may decide to study in another city
4625173 the russian tea room has played host to many famous faces throughout its 81 years we salute madonna on her 50th birthday and hope our former coat checker will come back and let us hang up her coat this time
4625174 madonna is not just an extraordinary woman to us she used to be part of the russian tea room family
4625175 madonna has truly made an impact on the russian tea rooms long history with her success it would be a great honour and pleasure to create something special for her after all she is family
4625176 since she is not interested i highly doubt that she will give a nominator the permission to do so
4625177 geopolitical concerns and the realization that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture said patrick ohare analyst at briefing com
4625178 australia has one of the safest aviation systems in the world
4625179 we know we dont have a systemic problem with maintenance and safety but some of the stuff were seeing published is pretty crazy
4625180 the cost pressures in every legacy carrier are just as intense as in qantas
4625181 all well established carriers have therefore increased the risk levels associated with maintenance throughout the world over the last decade
4625182 given that qantas had a leading position 10 years as the worlds safest then in all honesty it is probably still there
4625183 whats playing out is the tension of outsourcing everything and the timely and quality maintenance that was traditionally done by airlines
4625184 it just means that someone didnt lock it down properly before take off
4625185 legally qantas did not have to replace it and they could have flown on without a problem
4625186 a lot of these things are found when planes are on the ground and thats what the inspections are there for
4625187 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in its latest monthly forecast yesterday
4625188 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in
4625189 too many aussies own shares and pay these guys monopoly returns
4625190 the asx has not in all instances agreed with asics conclusions on the need for improvements but it has nevertheless agreed to make changes as agreed actions
4625191 our regulators have worked effectively to maintain confidence in the integrity of our markets in asics case our focus has been on the more difficult insider trading market manipulation and disclosure issues
4625192 i heard of one hedge fund trader who aggressively sold down an australian industrial company without owning shares or declaring it as a short sale by borrowing stock in order to deliver the sale
4625193 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4625194 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4625195 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4625196 somebody in the audience said dont you think mitt romney would make a terrific vice president
4625197 theres no doubt that a lot of people would love to see gov romney on the ticket
4625198 im appreciative every time i see mitt on television on my behalf
4625199 he does a better job for me than he did for himself as a matter of fact
4625200 hes doing what they ask him to do and he enjoys it
4625201 i think if he really thought he was auditioning for vice president he wouldnt be as good
4625202 a voice like dido amp the spirit of johnny cash
4625203 you go on out and ill bring your coffee to you
4625204 they are related to groups in germany and other parts of europe they will confront nazis wherever they find them theyre really quite intimidating and scary
4625205 if you too are sick of the baffling success of these thick tw ts their lies and their hate we urge you to join our mobilisation
4625206 we will be descending on their farm and wish to encourage as many people as possible to join us we at antifa intend to shut it down
4625207 ill just do my normal routine before the game and on the day and ill just turn up and play a normal match
4625208 im quite nervous but ill just take it as it comes
4625209 we know that weve got the players out but players are stepping up and weve got to raise to that potential
4625210 en santa cruz los discapacitados est n siendo utilizados pol ticamente y eso no se lo puede permitir ellos discapacitados tienen que demandar al senado nacional la aprobaci n de esta ley que ser de beneficio para ellos
4625211 como defensor del pueblo quiero expresar mi m s absoluto repudio a las acciones agresivas adoptadas por los rganos coercitivos del estado
4625212 no podemos permitir que a su domicilio ingresen y empiecen a hacer actos de represi n lo que nosotros hacemos es agotar la parte del di logo en principio y a partir de ese agotamiento es que necesariamente tenemos que convocarlos a que abandonen el lugar cuando se vulnera el orden p blico inmediatamente act a la polic a
4625213 the conventions are really the kickoff for whats going to be a very intense season of political coverage
4625214 liberty means responsibility that is why most men dread it
4625215 i believe in only one thing liberty but i do not believe in liberty enough to want to force it upon anyone
4625216 it behoves every man who values liberty of conscience for himself to resist invasions of it in the case of others or their case may by change of circumstances become his own
4625217 the flavors of the mediterranean with a modern twist on middle easts rustic eats
4625218 we are making progress but we still are not able to keep up the pressure for the whole game
4625219 el resultado de las encuestas depende de qui n las pague
4625220 en esta poca tengo un inter s muy fuerte por la tradici n y los temas nacionales
4625221 los programas open source no son una buena opci n para empresas medianas o grandes
4625222 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4625223 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4625224 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4625225 how the messianic jewish sect in israel is attempting to convert children idf soldiers and holocaust survivors and to bring them close to yeshu
4625226 one of thousands distributed in the streets of israel as a part of a jews for jesus campaign
4625227 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4625228 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4625229 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4625230 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4625231 those books have created a subliminal language and i think judgments will be made unconsciously about barack obama
4625232 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4625233 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4625234 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4625235 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4625236 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4625237 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4625238 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4625239 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4625240 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4625241 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4625242 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4625243 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4625244 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4625245 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4625246 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4625247 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4625248 he always was there always set the good example always fully available monetarily always stunk up the bathroom yak yak yak
4625249 he immediately mastered anything he took an interest in and enjoyed working on his already amazing body in the gym
4625250 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4625251 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4625252 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4625253 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4625254 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4625255 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4625256 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4625257 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4625258 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4625259 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4625260 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4625261 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4625262 sin querer o queriendo estos 3 chicos y su disco me hacen acordar a depeche mode y sus primeros discos canciones pegadizas y un synth pop adictivo que te hace escucharlo una y otra vez sin poder parar
4625263 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4625264 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4625265 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4625266 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4625267 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4625268 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4625269 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4625270 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4625271 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4625272 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4625273 this plant sits on the edge of a rain garden in the front of my house i just expanded the garden and planted it with a bunch of plants from the sale swamp milkweed monkeyflower turtlehead blue vervain side oats gramma and more if youre interested i can take pictures of this as they grow
4625274 henry saw these in my newest flower bed a few weeks ago and said i should take a picture and send it to you
4625275 i use whatever sticks i find on the ground and over the years i have way more than i need and poke them around and among freshly planted bulbs and other flowers that rabbits and squirrels like to eat to protect the bulbs from being dug up and eaten by said rs and sqs it discourages them and the method works
4625276 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4625277 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
4625278 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
4625279 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
4625280 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
4625281 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
4625282 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
4625283 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
4625284 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4625285 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4625286 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4625287 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4625288 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4625289 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4625290 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4625291 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4625292 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
4625293 we only had four two a days this year but we finished it with the old watermelon cuttin from the doug coggins family
4625294 wed like to thank them in front of everybody once you get going in camp its sort of like groundhog day and then the watermelon shows up and they know its close to the end im actually going to take this to my room and hoard it for myself i usually take it home but i think im going to keep this one for myself
4625295 we had the shortest scrimmage in the history of georgia football
4625296 that was mainly because of the number of guys that are banged up we didnt want to overwork the guys that are healthy
4625297 we worked primarily on a few different simulated situations today
4625298 we had a four minute drill where the offense took over for the last four minutes of a game and we needed a couple of first downs to run out the clock to win the game we worked on third and six seven eight nine and 10 we played overtime as the third overtime where if a team scores they have to go for two to seal the win we finished with goal line
4625299 cox got into the third and long situations which usually doesnt bode well because the defense can pin their ears back and really come after you
4625300 when my wife was dying of cancer she smoked marijuana
4625301 i was running from georgian troops i want to thank the russian troops
4625302 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4625303 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4625304 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4625305 the city set up the right tracking metrics and benchmarks if you cant measure it you cant manage it and you cant manage it if you are not measuring it
4625306 may take years before we even hear about it if at all
4625307 mayor pat morris recent attempt to blame the san bernardino police officers association sbpoa

4625313 negeri akhirat itu kami jadikan untuk orang orang yang tidak ingin menyombongkan diri dan berbuat kerusakan di muka bumi dan kesudahan yang baik itu adalah bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa
4625314 barangsiapa berlaku riya maka allah akan bersikap riya kepadanya dan barangsiapa menginginkan kemashyuran maka allah pun akan memamerkan kemashyuran kepadanya
4625315 mereka bermaksud riya dengan shalat di hadapan manusia dan tidaklah mereka menyebut nama allah kecuali sedikit sekali
4625316 janganlah sekali kali kamu menyangka bahwa orang orang yang gembira dengan apa yang telah mereka kerjakan dan mereka suka supaya dipuji terhadap perbuatan yang belum mereka kerjakan janganlah kamu menyangka bahwa mereka terlepas dari siksa dan bagi mereka siksa yang pedih
4625317 never leave her children no matter how hard things became

4625321 the thing about a doughnut hole is that it is empty
4625322 there is nothing and that it seems is what is left of barack obamas plan to fix social security
4625323 make no mistake what obama is really saying is that at least for the campaign he is walking away from social security and all of its problems
4625324 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4625325 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4625326 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4625327 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4625328 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4625329 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4625330 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4625331 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4625332 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4625333 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4625334 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4625335 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4625336 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4625337 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4625338 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4625339 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4625340 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4625341 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4625342 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4625343 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4625344 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4625345 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4625346 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4625347 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4625348 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4625349 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4625350 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4625351 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4625355 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4625356 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4625357 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4625358 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4625359 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4625360 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4625361 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4625364 sure debbie id love to have a conversation with you but considering the circumstances its just a little difficult
4625365 these programs are designed to help first time home buyers weigh the benefits of renting vs
4625366 if interest rates are near an all time low and beginning to inch upwards waiting could cost you more than you would think you might not be able to afford to buy a home at any price
4625367 for example in addition to the monthly principal and interest payments that you will have to finance the purchase of your home you will need to budget for utility bills property taxes insurance and maintenance costs if you buy a home that has a homeowners association you will also have to pay association fees some homes have special assessments in addition to the regular property taxes make sure that you ask the seller for copies of the past years
4625368 when purchasing a home title insurance is extremely important even so we still see a large number of homeowners that have no idea what it is or the protection it offers
4625369 good real estate agents will listen to your wants and needs and arrange to show only those homes that fit your particular parameters your agent should preview homes before showing them to you as well
4625370 recent data released by the national association of realtors indicates that real estate agents are failing to disclose whom they represent in transactions at an alarming rate even where state laws such as michigans agency disclosure law require them to do so in writing at their first substantive meeting with a potential client

4625373 a buyer purchased a home that cost him about 100 000 more than he was comfortable spending but he fell in love with the victorian character the high ceilings sparkling chandeliers and wide planked floors a year later he could no longer afford to make his mortgage payment the house was too expensive for him to maintain he would have been better off buying a smaller home in a more modest neighborhood but he let his soaring emotions cloud his good judgment since his purchase the market softened and he could not sell he lost his home to foreclosure
4625374 make your offer contingent on a home inspection an inspection will tell you about the condition of the home and can help you avoid buying a home that needs major repairs
4625375 real estate brokers regularly refer house inspectors to clients but its best to ask a non partial broker for references often the best sources for good house inspectors are friends whove recently bought houses and believe that their inspectors were honest thorough and highly professional
4625376 for a minimum fee the home warranty company will ensure that the house and the appliances are in working condition
4625377 as the closing date approaches youll need to arrange for the transfer of any remaining funds that are necessary to close the sale many buyers wire closing funds to the closing agent this may be an escrow office or an attorney depending on where youre buying
4625378 43 must know tips and resources for every first time home buyer
4625379 recent data released by the national association of realtors indicates that real estate agents are failing to disclose whom they represent in transactions at an alarming rate even where state laws such as michigans agency disclosure law require them to do so in writing at their first substantive meeting with a potential client
4625380 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4625381 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4625382 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4625383 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4625384 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4625385 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4625386 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4625387 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4625388 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4625389 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

4625391 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4625396 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4625397 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4625398 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4625399 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

4625405 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4625406 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

4625409 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4625410 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

4625413 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4625414 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4625415 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4625416 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4625417 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4625418 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4625419 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4625420 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4625421 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4625422 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4625423 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4625465 i know in my heart all his friends who died with him were living their prayer
4625466 but for the way they had lived they were pretty jazzed and happy because they held the lines and they loved helicopter rides
4625467 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in you lives
4625468 perhaps their gift will be saving the life of a future firefighter or helicopter pilot

4625486 the defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in louisiana to rally against racial intolerance

4625491 we left the day before they evacuated everybody we had a roast in the oven water was pouring in the basement
4625492 its depressing to stand here you cant justify anything that happened
4625493 we were fortunate that no one got hurt and nobody died and we know well go forward but how were going to go forward no one is quite sure yet its made a big difference in everyones lives her personally and financially

4625501 the questions from todays unchurched people are not are you calvinist or arminian
4625502 we love them and want them to meet jesus just as much as we do anyone else
4625503 well we will disagree on some pretty important stuff with people who do not love and trust in jesus but the story that tells us to believe and love jesus also tells us to love everyone no matter who they are and what they believe we care for them and love them just as much as anyone else and hope they meet jesus and learn to love him too we do not think we are better people than those in other religions and we recognize that there are a number of people who do not believe in jesus that have done great things for the world but we do think our story is the right one
4625504 pauls bible his education and his access to the scriptures of israel
4625505 theres a lot of resentment because if you are black you get picked up a lot
4625506 they see you in a car with a beeper and they assume you are a dope dealer the song is a way to get out aggression were not really urging anyone to go out and attack police
4625507 if you want to fight come up here on stage this aint the movie colors you didnt come to see a fight you came to see a concert
4625508 how many times i signed that name in my life
4625509 the thing that people dont talk about really is that it opened artists up to being themselves in a lot of ways they didnt have to try to figure out what to do or be to become stars they could just be themselves after n w a you didnt have to put on the polish to be a star
4625510 proves that even though hes middle aged hes still hungry
4625511 we thought our music was going to land on the shelves with the dirty comedy albums
4625512 when i was 16 if someone asked me what kind of career and life i wanted to have i would have shortchanged myself if i wrote it out then it wouldnt have come close to the reality there was no template then no way to picture where hip hop was going to go
4625513 i think about going to audio achievements at the end of van ness right there in torrance thats where we recorded it was a textbook 80s studio the wood paneling on the walls it was cold in there too we were used to working out of the garage man where it was sweaty and muggy we were in jackets and our teeth are chattering
4625514 you can hear the frustration with the situation we tried to have fun with it but the music was reflecting what was going on in the neighborhood living in the 1980s just trying to get by day by day in places where crack was huge and the police were crazy
4625515 then the rodney king thing happened a few years later and then all over the world people looked and said hey those guys from compton were right
4625516 do you like everything you made when you were 17
4625517 i always pass my bay view along so it circulates throughout the prison
4625518 you have an excellent newspaper one of the best in the country i feel because it courageously shines light on things going on in the world and next door that our people and all people need to know in order to make intelligent decisions about our lives and what were going to do about it thats all any good news outlet is supposed to do but few do it
4625519 i believe it was god that directed us to adopt hannah joy
4625520 she was a week shy of her first birthday when my wife and i went to china and adopted her it was an amazing experience
4625521 a month later i was searching the internet looking for links about orphans and adoption
4625522 i came upon bring me hope i thought it was neat that they helped orphans that were sometimes special needs or older kids that maybe didnt have the chance to be adopted like my daughter did i felt this was a good opportunity to give back and do something for some kids
4625523 bill called me one day and asked me if i was interested in going to the camp i said wow bill its awesome that you mention that because i looked into that camp a couple of years ago and ive just kind of been putting it off when he told me he was interested in going that confirmed it for me so we went together
4625524 we were there to hold their hands and take them from event to event and spend quality time with them
4625525 we started in morning assembly after breakfast theyd have dancing and singing then wed go to either arts and crafts time or to the water park where the kids had a water slide and water pistols they loved that then wed go to the pool most of them had never been swimming before it was a great time
4625526 theyre great kids and you could see them transform you could tell that they werent used to being loved on they were shy at first and kind of standoffish but at the end of the week they had given me hugs and were telling me they loved me it was really touching
4625527 at the start of camp dominic was definitely a tough kid
4625528 i found out that hed been at the orphanage four years and before that hed been living on the streets i can only imagine what his life was like and what kind of experiences he went through but i saw god transform him into a sweet little kind boy i will always hear stone calling my name i dont think there is a kinder soul that i have ever met ill be continuing to pray for them
4625529 since ive been home there hasnt been a moment that i havent thought about them
4625530 it was sad to see them go but they went back to the orphanage happy and with hope that they would have a family some day
4625531 dear peter thank you so much for the hamburgers i liked it and i am so happy to be with you i will remember you forever i will miss you too i hope i can play with you in the future thank you and i hope you are healthy and everything is okay
4625532 its certainly on the table we would certainly be thrilled to make it but were going to wait until the series has finished
4625533 its always been a desire but weve always known that for the writers its so hard for them to actually get through the series every year that we put the film on the back burner that we would do it after the series was over and that might be as soon as next year

4625540 yes lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts
4625541 no one is more pleasurable to be around than a person who has had her cup filled by the lord jesus christ
4625542 the bedrock of our christian faith is the unmerited fathomless marvel of the love of god exhibited on the cross of calvary a love we never can and never shall meritt undaunted radiance is not built on anything passing but on the love of god that nothing can alter the experiences of life terrible or monotonous are impotent to touch the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
4625543 yes lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts

4625549 yes lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts
4625550 what in the world was i thinking i should have just left her on the shelf somewhere
4625551 come to me when you are weak and weary rest snugly in my everlasting arms i do not despise your weakness my child actually it draws me closer to you because weakness stirs up my compassion my yearning to help accept yourself in your weariness knowing that i understand how difficult your journey has been do not compare yourself with others who seem to skip along their life paths with ease their journeys have been different from yours and i have gifted them with abundant energy i have gifted you with fragility providing opportunities for your spirit to blossom in my presence accept this gift as a sacred treasure delicate yet glowing with brilliant light rather than struggling to disguise or deny your weakness allow me to bless you richly through it
4625552 yes lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts
4625553 so he came near and kissed him and isaac smelled his clothing and blessed him and said the scent of my son is as the odor of a field which the lord has blessed

4625558 in part 3 of my interview with olympic champion lori ann muenzer we talk about her new book one gear no breaks and the documentary of the same name
4625559 lets tackle a universal question in everyones life what is our purpose for being here
4625560 this universe the one you helped me build with your fears and ideas is governed by happiness or rather an incomplete definition of it
4625561 one more thing about that afternoon on the front steps i remember thinking what a great dad i had and how much i wished he could be my teacher now i know he was he truly was
4625562 we become like the 5 people we spend the most time with
4625563 how i finally passed my big test and hints to help you pass yours
4625564 diet alone took me from always tired with no energy to full of beans so what did i do
4625565 without doubt the toughest sale i ever have to make and i make it daily is the value idea notion concept whatever you want to call it of discipline when i tell people that they dont need a pill powder potion product gadget or gizmo they simply need some discipline in their world they are typically disappointed

4625569 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4625570 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of if they somehow enable them
4625571 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4625572 why do you want to invest in the silver etf slv can it be trusted its just a paper game who knows if they actually have real silver better to hold the physical or buy from a trusted source
4625573 things are looking opposite now as silver is going down down down are there any chances for it to recover in next one month
4625574 i can remember near the 1980 top when a backlash began to emerge against those who were making big money speculating on commodities speculator became a dirty word and even governments began to flout speculators as the villains behind high prices
4625575 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4625576 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4625577 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4625578 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4625579 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4625580 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4625581 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4625582 it is disappointing to see howard dean trying to use gender and race to divide voters his comments are insulting inappropriate and have no place in this election
4625583 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more
4625584 a time in the life of a business when its fundamentals are about to change that change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights but it may just as likely signal the beginning of the end
4625585 they build up force so insidiously that you may have a hard time even putting a finger on what has changed yet you know that something has
4625586 were so fucking hungry axe that thing so we can eat you stupid fucking toad
4625587 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4625588 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4625589 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4625590 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4625591 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour
4625592 i guess that coming from a kind of sister country australia theres a good vibe
4625593 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify
4625594 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4625595 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4625596 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4625597 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around
4625598 if i keep playing solid golf it will all take care of itself
4625599 its that old clich about just taking one shot at a time
4625600 i didnt start out hitting it that good and then around the turn i got the feeling it might be a real good day
4625601 anytime you can turn that back nine in under par youre setting yourself up for a good round
4625602 i feel like im getting better at working the ball both ways and you have to do that out here be it with tree lines or the undulations in the fairways youve got to turn it both ways
4625603 yesterday i had a few more putts that went in than today for the most part it was just a consistent round of golf no big putts no big mistakes
4625604 its golf yeah it gets frustrating but theres so much golf to be played im going to work on it this afternoon and see if we cant capitalize on it tomorrow
4625605 dont you hate when your jacking off to the myspace ads and realize tom is staring back at you grinning judging

4625609 the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
4625610 quite honestly we cannot afford to fight for principle at this point when the law is against us
4625611 no person shall possess any handgun except when said handgun is kept at the residence for self protection
4625612 football will be an olympic sport as it continues to grow in popularity around the world

4625618 there will be a discontinuation of the current propellant cfc thats in bronchodilator rescue inhalers
4625619 many patients have already made the switch to the hfa propellant and in many cases they may not even realize they made the switch because the medication remains the same and works the same
4625620 it doesnt linger very long in your mouth its not a bad taste its just a medicine y taste
4625621 if i am going to be participating in a sport where im going to be running a lot or biking a lot then i will just take a quick puff right before
4625622 i just want to know at the end of my days that i can rest next to my son
4625623 young people die in wars and many of them do not have a spouse or a dependent but they do have surviving parents
4625624 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4625625 i get lots of watery eyes and runny nose and mostly have to stay indoors
4625626 so one of the ideas is that stress causes certain chemicals to be poured into the blood
4625627 these could cause some inflammation and that inflammation can lead on to worsening of your allergies
4625628 although i have a lot of allergies they found out today that im also under a lot of stress lately
4625629 a lot of things that i get which are sinus infections and upper respiratory infections are all brought on mostly by allergies
4625630 there are certain exercises that are really soothing swimming is one of them
4625631 i mean a sweatshirt how could a sweatshirt be recalled
4625632 thank goodness i had a flat only and wasnt on the highway and didnt have blowout
4625633 it is difficult they are hiding their light under a bushel
4625634 the information that the retailers gather about us when we shop there is not being used for our benefit
4625635 so the consumer literally has to navigate through dozens of websites if they are so inclined to try and find out if their product is safe or not
4625636 re re re re re re re re all right well call me later
4625637 its 4 a m i cant sleep someone talk to me
4625638 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is

4625640 i have to come and check on him to make sure hes ok
4625641 i tell them he ate breakfast at 5 oclock in the afternoon but then hed eat dinner at 1 oclock at night
4625642 i have to teach people what i know worked for me im responsible but what they poured into me how they blessed my life the older generation now that im a part of the older generation its my responsibility to pour into the generation thats come after me
4625643 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for
4625644 im fired up about firing up young people to understand their power and their worth
4625645 i love singing with bebe we have a great time on stage in the studio we have a great time we do what we do and so its not something thats weird i think im more at home with that than even by myself
4625646 always sisters becoming the princess you were created to be
4625647 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4625648 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4625649 i was in high school when she hit it big
4625650 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4625651 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4625652 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4625653 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4625654 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4625655 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4625656 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4625657 film which appealed to older women because of its portrayal of the late 40s and 50s as a still sexy time of life
4625658 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4625659 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4625660 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4625661 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4625662 a special screening of juan antonio bardems long lost masterpiece death of a cyclist muerte de un ciclista a rarely seen indictment of 1950s spanish society under francos rule that was unavailable for over 50 years until its release on dvd this year by the criterion collection bardem uncle of oscar winning actor javier bardem no country for old men was in jail for political dissent when this film won the international critics award at the 1955 cannes film festival even francos censure could not repress its influence and artistic merit

4625875 weve come out these first two games and weve given up seven points fast you just want to be sharp play fast play physical and play our game hopefully we can get that done
4625876 i was proud of the way we handled carolina we came out had a rough first four plays then we put a solid drive together we came back and handled the pressure i think if we had played a little longer we would have done better we were finally getting a grasp of what theyre doing
4625877 atlanta we have a little bit more of a feel for what theyre going to do i think well get a little more time this weekend and its time to get a rhythm its time to get a couple of solid drives going its time to put the ball in the end zone and get to celebrate a little

4625898 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4625943 i think about going to audio achievements at the end of van ness right there in torrance thats where we recorded it was a textbook 80s studio the wood paneling on the walls it was cold in there too we were used to working out of the garage man where it was sweaty and muggy we were in jackets and our teeth are chattering

4625965 what he did was he grabbed her and pulled her in the alley and threatened to cut her throat at which time she was sexually assaulted

4625980 the airport provides a high exposure venue to share some of the incredible content that we have archived
4625981 although surfing is thought to have originated with the ancient polynesians it was through its introduction to southern california by hawaiians such as duke kahanamoku in the early 1900s when surfing experienced its first boom
4625982 today the surf industry based in orange county has become a 6 billion plus market with its influence reaching a worldwide audience weve captured its roots and progress with this exhibit

4626021 i have so much to say i think of myself as primarily a writer i love performing and i love singing its everything to me but id definitely put writing first as the most important form of communication and i think that being able to express myself in this mass form and having this online technology at my fingertips is so important because it gives you the ability to reach so many people that you would have never ordinarily reached and especially through writing where you do have the chance to think about it a little bit no just ranting but where you actually have time to think about things and digest it and making analogies between your life and whats going on in the world or pointing out discrepancies that are going on which people might not even notice i try to pick up on current events as well as current events in my life and just make parallels hopefully people read them and are entertained a bit maybe they feel better or maybe it makes them angry and makes them think all you can do is hope for a dialog so i think my online presence is probably the most important asset on par with actually touring
4626022 i dont write because im upset or angry im just inspired by the fact that i know people are reading it i know that they are listening theres a dialog going back and forth usually i get hundreds of responses to each blog which is really massive either theyll post their comments on the actual blog or theyll email me separately i try to talk about things that i think sometimes isnt talked about very much in an intelligent fashion when youre a writer you really need to present things objectively so people can form their own opinions because its not really up to you to try and cover facts with your own thoughts its up to you as a writer to express your thoughts as your thoughts and as objectively as possible
4626023 when i went to berkeley and it was a lot about planning your own voice i remember i wrote a 10 page paper on one word in a novel on what that word meant in the context of the book it was all about how you feel and how things make you feel then i went to law school and it was all about objective its reason without passion its looking at something and presenting it as it is and not letting what you feel cloud over it or letting your emotions dictate whats going on its saying these are the facts and this is why you should see my side so i often try to incorporate that in my songwriting where im saying this is how i feel but at the same time saying these are the facts and how i interpret them and making sure each song
4626024 i never write a song just to write a song i write because something actually happened so every single word is real and i try to make sure the writing shows all sides theres always three sides both peoples opinions and then theres the truth i try to show as much as possible the truth
4626025 i couldnt have done this without fans like that i couldnt have done this without the people that believed and cared showed me all their support the label and i are not trying to jam this album or me or my writing or my blogs down peoples throats we want people to find them we want people to want to listen and to want to read and converse people write to me and i write them back i read all the comments people write on my websites weve noticed that if its good people understand it its cathartic and they can relate to it then people will find it i love making people happy and making them feel better i always have its always been who i am

4626027 the phone apparently a hot item to show off in googles cafeterias these days is big and bulky and not as sleek as the iphone and android while extremely powerful has a less elegant less user friendly interface than the iphone does this mean it wont sell well of course not theres a lot more variables like device and contract pricing software and services etc that will help determine its commercial success
4626028 lets get right to it this morning were happy to report that all of our shipping centers are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail if a member should have been shipped a disc tuesday wednesday or thursday with rare exception it will ship today friday as a result millions of our members will receive dvds on saturday in time we hope for some weekend movie enjoyment but we know thats not enough the service interruption we experienced this week inconvenienced many of our members and put us in the awful position of disappointing people so were taking added measures for all members whose shipments have been delayed well be automatically applying a 15 credit to their next billing statement or for new members whose first shipments have been delayed well automatically extend their free trial by a week

4626030 it is unfortunate for mentor graphics shareholders however that despite our best efforts mentor graphics board and management were unwilling to engage in substantive discussions on what we believe would have been a compelling opportunity to create significant value for both companies shareholders and customers mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders
4626031 mentor graphics was aware that as described in the cadence press release cadence was facing challenges in obtaining financing for the transaction additionally today the federal trade commission made a second request indicating that regulatory review of the previously proposed transaction would have been protracted
4626032 the organization describes the new procedures as being simpler that seems up for debate at the very least until now everybodys know exactly what to do with a laptop take it out of its case from now on presumably some people will try to send their computers through the x ray in the case and learn that theyve got the wrong kind of case only once its inside the x ray and the rules about other stuff in the case seem like theyll lead to people frantically repacking their luggage while in line

4626051 gerrit cole is not going to sign with us its as simple as that
4626052 unfortunately he wants to pursue college and he does not have an interest in pursuing professional baseball its not a money negotiating issue as much as a life choice at this moment in time
4626053 we knew when we selected gerrit cole that there was a signability issue
4626054 to be truthful that signability issue spoke more to the difficulty in negotiation not his interest level being college versus pro at the time that we selected him his interest was to play professionally although he had a choice to go to college
4626055 obviously between drafting him and aug 15 after a lot of thought the family and the player made a life choice that they want to forgo professional baseball for now
4626056 we wished we could have signed him we wished we could have negotiated with him
4626057 my stance and preference from draft day has been to sign with the yankees i am simply awaiting to find out from them if they wish to sign me

4626063 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4626064 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4626065 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4626066 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4626067 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4626068 theres a part of me that wants so bad to go for obama
4626069 and another part that says play it safe and go for mccain
4626070 is he clear and consistent in his thinking i hope the boy is solid but at 70 71
4626071 want to make sure mccains mind is clear hes a tough guy hes served his country and paid his dues hes john mccain but that merits a closer look the big question in this race is is he competent
4626072 his lack of experience may hurt him and his race to some people thats something they cant get past are we ready that will be part of the equation but on the flip side of that inexperience is vigor and new ideas and change
4626073 you cant drill yourself out of this mess youve got to rethink how you live
4626074 they do seem to both be moral people though is what you think you know about john mccain true and could obama be in that church he was in and not have it rub off
4626075 im not really outgoing but i was able to do it
4626076 theyre friends and have a lot in common but he hasnt been governor that long
4626077 i dont think either one of them has a good plan
4626078 anything john mccain says and thats all i have to say
4626079 peron said that by now hopefully madonna has realised that her daughter lourdes is a reincarnated evita peron
4626080 it seems that madonna spent so much time at evitas grave doing research for her film role as evita that evita herself took over madonnas body during filming
4626081 those among us who are sensitive to this kind of thing can actually see eva peron going into madonnas body when she sings dont cry for me argentina in the balcony scene evita chose madonna as a mother figure and became lourdes
4626082 madonna fell pregnant with lourdes while she was making the film
4626083 writing producing and directing will be the best career path for madonna in the future shell succeed with this
4626084 she madonna wanted it for a while but she couldnt bring herself to spend that much money on a watch
4626085 since she is not interested i highly doubt that she will give a nominator the permission to do so
4626086 she has delved into hinduism in the past but i fear hers was a hurried glimpse into the vast sea of knowledge hinduism offers
4626087 hinduism consists of a rich and long tradition of philosophical thought dating back to about 3 000 bc which requires a wholehearted study and devotion
4626088 while wishing her all the best on her 50th birthday we would encourage madonna to undertake a serious study of hinduism its scriptures its schools of philosophy doctrines and practices
4626089 we would be willing to provide her with all the help answer her queries and guide her on her journey to explore hinduism and its concepts
4626090 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
4626091 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
4626092 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
4626093 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
4626094 we were building up a pyramid the girls had to run up jump on the trampoline vault and then flip onto the top of the pyramid
4626095 when madonna did her little flip and got up there it turned out she had nude tights on and it looked like she wasnt wearing anything under her skirt i was shocked at first and the basketball coach was really upset
4626096 she used to come into our office before class wed put on the music and make her dance and entertain us as well as everyone else in the locker room
4626097 madonna was a determined grade a student i dont want to say she was a nerdy kid but she was more along that sort of line than a trouble maker
4626098 for the umpteenth time when my teenage daughter proudly said to me
4626099 so i knew this was a covert cue from my daughter for me to acknowledge her work and give my heavily biased highly positive and opinionated summation of my wifes new hairstyle which was in actual fact very good maybe its got something to do with the fact that my wife is pretty anyway
4626100 and dragged myself up from where i was sitting to have a closer and better look
4626101 and i meant it because she is wheres all this leading well hang with me for a minute and youll
4626102 they bring their mattress every night we put them on the floor
4626103 its safer here because you got gunfire comin from this way
4626104 i feel like if you work and if you pay taxes you should have the right to walk anywhere you feel like whenever you feel ready
4626105 im gettin older but them childrens got a life and i want em to have a good life i think we doing the right thing by having the curfew
4626106 theyre deciding who to stop theyre enforcing the law depending on what the person looks like to them
4626107 thats what they do in dictatorships thats what they do in
4626108 i know they have problems there and im very sympathetic but there are cities all over the country where there are hundreds of deaths and hundreds of violent crimes and they dont do this
4626109 ive heard the critics and they make an academic argument but i invite them to come down here on the streets and deal with the problems weve been dealin with
4626110 working with her is an endless experimentation to gain a perfect result shes very demanding but weve learned so much from her
4626111 she is fashion her styles are always inspiring i liked the early looks but shes even better now her personality her unique strength and will that is stronger than just one look she is beyond looks she is madonna
4626112 shes the essence of the american dream professionalism obsession and ambition
4626113 the russian tea room has played host to many famous faces throughout its 81 years we salute madonna on her 50th birthday and hope our former coat checker will come back and let us hang up her coat this time
4626114 madonna is not just an extraordinary woman to us she used to be part of the russian tea room family
4626115 madonna has truly made an impact on the russian tea rooms long history with her success it would be a great honour and pleasure to create something special for her after all she is family

4626269 a healthy relationship is one in which two people encourage each other to reach their respective goals while sharing each others hopes and dreams a relationship should be a source of inspiration invigoration and hope
4626270 love is not two people gazing at each other but two people looking ahead together in the same direction by antoine de saint
4626271 if you lose yourself in love just because you are bored and veer from your path in life then love is nothing more than escapism
4626272 happiness is not something that anyone else even a lover can give you you have to achieve it by yourself and the only way to do so is by developing your own character and capacity as a human being by fully maximising your potential if you sacrifice your own growth and talent for love you absolutely will not find happiness
4626273 it is demeaning to be constantly seeking approval if you find yourself in a relationship where you are not treated the way your heart tells you you should be i hope you will have the courage and dignity to decide that you are better off running the risk of being alone for the time being rather than enduring an unhappy relationship

4626489 there were one or two police personnel arrested by the aca this year and we have been very cooperative with the agency
4626490 no matter what the event is i want to win but it didnt happen
4626491 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4626492 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes i knew it was tight but not that tight
4626493 the club needs time but we will never have it the situation at paris means it is necessary to have results immediately
4626494 a defeat against bordeaux wouldnt be easy to live with but it will not be the end
4626495 to start with a victory was great but now we have to maintain our position
4626496 its going to be hard against rennes but playing at home where were are invincible will be a plus
4626497 they say malaysians are very nice but i want industrialists and entrepreneurs to acknowledge the high skills and capabilities of our youth
4626498 weve established numerous training institutes to train our workers in line with our aspirations to be a developed nation our skilled workers are our strength and asset
4626499 he is an affectionate guy but he takes his work very seriously and in training he is definitely a bit harder with us
4626500 we have some big games coming up one of those is at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4626501 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4626502 they are a great team and were looking forward to seeing what were made of
4626503 i expect great ball movement great execution and a very intelligent team so were really going to have to study them evaluate them and try to pick them apart
4626504 one thing thats on my list is to stop pau from winning a gold medal
4626505 kobe is funny he is always playing with his statements
4626506 i hope we meet in the gold medal match then we will see
4626507 ive not been feeling well for a few days and i felt very weak today i even felt sapped of energy just putting my gloves on
4626508 i felt good and relaxed i just wanted to make it through
4626509 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4626510 no lance eu tentei subir para cabecear e mandar a bola para o lado tive que fazer o movimento com o tronco e na hora senti uma dor muito forte
4626511 a les o do fumagalli n o t o simples quanto parece ele j est com menos dores mas na hora do movimento do chute elas aumentam profundamente essa o tipo da les o pode demorar de uma semana at 45 dias para que o atleta fique curado
4626512 em alguns casos o atleta fica com essa dor por muito tempo mas nada que o impe a de exercer sua profiss o
4626513 n o sabia que era uma coisa t o grave mas acho que o pior agora j passou
4626514 todas as vezes que eu saio de casa com a minha fam lia os torcedores chegam junto perguntando quando eu vou voltar ao time estou at evitando sair um pouco para me concentrar no meu tratamento e poder voltar 100 est dif cil segurar essas dores mas estou me superando para voltar o quanto antes
4626515 gostei das duas forma es tivemos bastante volume de jogo durante todo o treino se eu escalar o ruy na ala tenho que atuar com tr s zagueiros pois ele um jogador bastante ofensivo o importante que os jogadores est o conscientes do que devem fazer em campo independente da forma como a gente vai jogar
4626516 h uma rotatividade de atletas grande e no momento crucial do campeonato quando os jogos passaram a acontecer na quarta e no domingo est vamos com um grupo reduzido e ainda perdemos tr s atletas importantes geraldo ruy e felipe come ou a procura por atletas e eles chegaram com meses de inatividade os casos de fabiano gadelha e maurinho por exemplo o ideal que esses jogadores trabalhassem a parte f sica durante 15 a 20 dias mas eles tiveram que ser aproveitados logo reinaldo por exemplo com quatro dias de treinos teve que entrar contra o cruzeiro
4626517 ele fez algumas partidas ruins quando chegou e a torcida pegou no p dele torcedor quer resultados mas o jogador precisa de ritmo de jogo para ter um bom rendimento
4626518 alguns jogadores sentiram mais que os outros s o os casos de tic o vagner e everaldo que est o jogando como titulares desde o in cio da temporada nas ltimas semanas a gente quase n o treinou fez apenas o trabalho de recupera o
4626519 dividimos os jogadores em tr s grupos um que precisa de um trabalho moderado outro que precisa ganhar ritmo de jogo e talvez at pediremos alguns amistosos e outro que precisa se condicionar para os jogos
4626520 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
4626521 we dont have positive cases yet we are very proud of this
4626522 we must think of ways to propel malaysians to greater heights including the malays to have first class minds
4626523 this can be done if we work hard especially in improving our knowledge
4626524 you probably dont want to go two match points down but i probably needed a tough match like this
4626525 its been a little bit since i toughed one of those out so hopefully in the long run it will end up being a good thing
4626526 for me playing in this match would be special and if i can score that will also be nice but only if we win

4626533 it all started when they gallup called me when they realised how much data they had on what muslims think
4626534 the more we talked the idea of a book made more sense and they wanted dalia and me to work on it together
4626535 i brought to the book an academic expertise while dalia brought to it her data analyst expertise

4626565 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
4626566 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
4626567 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story

4626582 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4626613 you already know more than i do i cant teach you anything you dont already know it would be wrong to take credit for teaching you when i didnt
4626614 do you have any doubt in your ability to train newbies in survival skills any doubt at all even the smallest
4626615 last fall i had to give additional training to three of my newbies so they would be ready for winter i thought they were trained well enough and then realized they werent so i took extra time and gave them more training
4626616 what does the council of elders think of your training
4626617 because the newbies i train are happier and healthier than a lot of the others they also seem to make good trainers themselves and are mostly willing to train through the winter
4626618 your parents created this program to bring people up to a certain skill level in both knowledge and demonstrated ability do you believe you have reached that skill level and are ready to move on to the next
4626619 but you cant advance because the program will not allow early advancement even if you are already prepared correct
4626620 i already know how to survive how to defend myself and i am also a healer i also know advanced techniques that my grandfather taught your parents and other advanced techniques that your parents in turn taught my grandfather
4626621 your parents are no longer human and they are dying they are asking for our help
4626622 they have developed their spirit bodies to the point they are almost physical in fact once their spirit bodies were physical and they could go anywhere they wished by changing their physical bodies to energy and teleporting instantly to where they wanted to go they cant do that anymore
4626623 your uncle captured them and imprisoned them he wired them like electrical components into the circuitry of a machine and they have been kept alive artificially for over twenty years in special fluid filled tanks
4626624 i have traveled in the spirit to where they are kept imprisoned their physical bodies have mutated and become grossly deformed only their spirits remain human they wish to be free of their physical bodies and become simply the lord and lady but your uncle wont let them die
4626625 i need to know for myself i need to see them and talk with them i need them to tell me

4626678 i fully document all arguments and contentions i make extensively footnoting all references

4626680 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4626681 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4626682 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the u s senate
4626683 obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was a muslim
4626684 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be
4626685 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4626686 the most popular human being that has ever existed in the united states
4626687 of all the forms of tyranny the least attractive and most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth the tyranny of plutocracy
4626688 i have always maintained that our worst revolutionaries today are those reactionaries who do not see and will not admit that there is any need for change
4626689 all men who feel any power of joy in battle know what it is like when the wolf rises in the heart
4626690 i entirely agree with you that as a race in the mass they are inferior to the whites
4626691 i do not know a white man in the south who is as good a man as booker washington today

4626693 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford
4626694 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats
4626695 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
4626696 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
4626697 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
4626698 i grew up playing in what was a field right here but its not the same its very different and it happened so fast that the people in the rest of virginia are kind of shell shocked
4626699 ill vote for anybody who can get more than half the vote
4626700 its upsetting to me that the country is 50 50 im sick of it and i think a lot of people that lean more conservative feel the same way
4626701 i was going to do it simply as a spoiler with no idea in the world of voting for him later on
4626702 he said were not red states or blue states we are the united states and i thought finally somebody said it it literally made me cry then again im menopausal
4626703 the tv was turned this way i wasnt watching it i was just listening all of a sudden i just got chills all over me and i started laughing because it was so unexpected i dont even remember what it was he said
4626704 dyed in the wool republicans are saying obama is not that awfully bad
4626705 he appeals to me at some level that even though i cant account for it in terms of issues im going to listen to my gut and support a candidate that is just appealing to me for whatever reason whether thats shallow or because hes marketed well im not sure
4626706 if mccain had stood up and given the best speech of his life and had people electrified to vote for him then id vote for him
4626707 but it just so happens that it was obama he has touched something in me and in a whole lot of friends of mine that have never voted for a democrat and in a lot of people who honestly would never consider voting for a black man we all feel that something has to change and now for the first time theres the possibility that something can be different
4626708 in presidential elections you have between 4 and 11 percent of each party regularly defecting to the other side think of it the other way that means 90 percent or more of partisans vote for the candidate of their party
4626709 we will be very strong in the rural areas for a long time
4626710 so keep fightin for freedom and justice beloveds but dont you forget to have fun doin it lord let your laughter ring forth be outrageous ridicule the fraidy cats rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce and when you get through kickin ass and celebratin the sheer joy of a good fight be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was

4626780 we hope that we can count on you to take this matter back to the first circuit so that the nrc will finally be forced to address the significant public health and environmental risks posed by high density pool storage of spent fuel at plants such as pilgrim and vermont yankee
4626781 unlike the nrc you the attorneys general and congressman markey and sen clinton understand that the nrc has ignored new and significant information regarding the severe consequences and environmental impacts of spent fuel pool accidents and the increased risks of such an accident
4626782 spent fuel pools like pilgrims and vermont yankees are especially vulnerable to attack because they are located in the attic of the reactor outside primary containment with the thin roof overhead
4626783 your hearing request in the pilgrim and vermont yankee cases constitutes the single most important opportunity to challenge the risks posed by these above ground pools

4626788 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4626789 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4626790 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4626791 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4626792 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4626793 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4626794 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4626795 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4626800 a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4626801 gmb members cannot afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4626802 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises

4627168 oh my god that is julia child standing there waving my hunk of cheese around and telling everyone around us how to use it
4627169 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4627170 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4627171 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4627172 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4627173 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4627174 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4627175 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4627176 the agfp is used to provide guarantee coverage to unsecured loans from financial institutions to small farmers engaged in rice and or food production projects or activities

4627179 gee mom the doors stuck looks like we cant do math bummer
4627180 well yeah if you keep it on there long enough
4627181 you know they wont sell these cans to teenagers because of the crazy stuff they do with them here let me show you what it does
4627182 i really wouldnt want to see a brain after its been on that stuff
4627183 school wont answer the door when real chances to learn come knocking
4627184 very good pronounced another teacher who at that moment had arrived on the scene we all jumped what did very good have to do with anything she continued and which amendment prohibited slavery the thirteenth answered young exactly and with that lets be on our way suggested our chaperon brightly these rest of us looked at each other in vague incredulity the disruption of learning was more awkwardly obvious than usual then we trudged up the steps behind her

4627187 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4627188 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4627189 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding

4627191 we know that tv viewership goes up 40 per cent during the olympic period
4627192 we are also hoping that while people are looking at people swimming and playing athletics in their athletic peak they will also be thinking about their own health decisions
4627193 its very very powerful i think its the build up of all those different images that song is just so haunting that i think it will get an emotional response
4627194 it is a hard hitting tv commercial we make no apologies about that because we also know that graphic television advertising really does work the best
4627195 when you create this relentless procession of smoking caused diseases you get this very compelling and very intense piece of communication
4627196 thats around 290 000 less smokers today than in 1997
4627197 we are absolutely committed to electing barack obama and this is the best way to do it so let people have their moment
4627198 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
4627199 its a free country and some of the more passionate and less say constructive of her supporters are a very very small minority might try to do something like that
4627200 no one can be associated with more loyalty and dedication than i towards sen clinton and i will and many of us will be very critical of anybody on the convention floor to do anything that undermines sen obama
4627201 if that happened if someone who hogs the microphone or tries to demagogue or tries to be negative there will no sympathy from hillary clinton or loyalists such as myself
4627202 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
4627203 do you want to get into that its kind of wonky
4627204 if what lanny davis says is true the senator clinton will loose some loyal supporters if the nomination is scripted to occur this way she would have been better off not contributing to the mockery
4627205 morris says this makes obama look like a pushover it was supposed to be his convention and now its hillarys
4627206 i expect a lot of nauseating lip service which ill ignore
4627207 dropping in the polls like a lead rock in a glass of kool aid
4627208 this makes me more anxious to hear pres bill clinton speak his mind on this entire fiasco man chomping at the bits just thinking about all the ways the big dawg settles his scores
4627209 fight manuver pledge agree to conditions placate swear to genuflect and sign a loyalty pledge
4627210 im not ready to give up on hillary in 2008 yet and i wont give up until the bitter end this is no time to waffle on that imo i am arguing for a redoubled effort based on the partial success of getting the party to put hillarys name on the ballot now we have to make sure the vote isnt just symbolic
4627211 clinton will have no sympathy for some of her supporters who pledge to continue to try to get her nominated at the convention
4627212 jeez louise i am beyond tired of the its his convention bs

4627219 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4627220 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4627221 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4627252 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4627253 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4627254 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4627255 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4627256 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown

4627290 very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia
4627291 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4627292 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4627293 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4627294 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals

4627412 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4627413 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4627414 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4627415 by prohibiting mandatory overtime new york states hospitals and health care facilities will be able to provide a greater quality of care to its patients

4627419 the heart of the argument on appeal concerns whether the terms of the artistic license are conditions of or merely covenants to the copyright license
4627420 american copyright law as presently written does not recognize moral rights or provide a cause of action for their violation since the law seeks to vindicate the economic rather than the personal rights of authors
4627421 the conditions set forth in the artistic license are vital to enable the copyright holder to retain the ability to benefit from the work of downstream users
4627422 the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions

4627441 weve really been coming on strong the last couple weeks
4627442 weve come so far as an organization this year its a satisfying feeling to see all that hard work turn into success but youre only as good as your last race the goal is leave michigan the same way we left watkins glen on top

4627444 nuestra apuesta es que desarrollando las capacidades de la propia poblaci n de sus organizaciones y de las instituciones locales se facilita la rehabilitaci n y se reduce la vulnerabilidad a futuro
4627445 igual todo sigue igual parece que el terremoto fue ayer
4627446 el terremoto acentu la pobreza en que viv an las familias pues muchos de ellos perdieron sus fuentes de trabajo y no las han podido recuperar las condiciones de inseguridad en las que viven tambi n son una traba para que retomen sus actividades econ micas a un ritmo regular pues la poblaci n siente miedo de perder las inversiones que pudieran hacer
4627447 mejorar las fuentes de trabajo reforzar las condiciones de seguridad dar las facilidades legales para que se puedan construir las viviendas y sobre todo seguir trabajando con las autoridades locales y regionales y junto con la poblaci n siguen siendo los aspectos a priorizar nos sentimos satisfechos de haber apoyado a las autoridades de la zona dando un empuje inicial ahora ellos deben continuar con el trabajo

4627458 while the government would love to internalize more things they just dont have the people
4627459 so they have to come to contractors for those solutions
4627460 i would expect any service like this to go through cycles but i think they can come through this downturn pretty cleanly
4627461 the insurance carriers are cutting back on their fixed cost were a variable cost
4627462 its easy to assume parliament houses 646 men and women who are all obsessed with ambition and determined to cling to their seats at all costs its healthy to be reminded that just occasionally thats not true

4627471 it is surprising that nasa would allow our competitor to revise its proposal to cure a disqualifying legal deficiency without affording est which was determined to be fully eligible for award of the contract to address any lesser issues
4627472 we continue to believe our team offered an innovative and comprehensive solution to develop and produce the next spacesuit for nasa

4627477 its important to invest in the areas youth and provide creative outlets that allow kids to experience something otherwise unavailable
4627478 i have a son in the park hill school district and ive always felt it important to contribute in a creative way to the education of our areas children for young writers the contest process is likely to be one of the first avenues for publication in the areas of short fiction and poetry
4627479 there really is a process to be learned and as with most things experience is a large part of giving a person confidence and understanding in the steps necessary to submit a piece to a contest
4627480 and i hope to see the community embrace and grow the contest in upcoming years
4627481 the contest is very new something the contest and my consulting firm have in common
4627482 whatever costs are not covered by the contest sponsors and sale of innovations the publication that results from the contest is covered by innovative my goal is to make enough profit in selling the publication so we can break even on our end and generate funds for the schools respective ptas

4627491 since the program started in 2003 volunteer dentists in eastern jackson county have donated more than 270 000 in free dental care to nearly 450 children
4627492 many of the children in the program have extensive dental problems and would not see a dentist if the dental for kids program did not exist
4627493 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4627494 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4627499 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4627500 im saying theres been this fictionalized life story put out by obama in his autobiography that has been magnified during the campaign and the truth is dramatically different in many instances from what obama represents
4627501 if the fundamental smear of unfit for command was that john kerry was no war hero the insinuation of mr corsis latest is that mr obama is a closet muslim and militant black activist drug user
4627502 it will spur debate and i think sen obama should get used to a very critical examination of his history and his tenure in the u s senate the same thing is also going to happen to sen mccain
4627503 just as unfit for command contains false attacks on sen john kerrys military service the obama nation similarly contains numerous falsehoods about sen barack obama
4627504 several of the books accusations are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
4627505 oregons signature verification standards are uniform and specific enough to ensure equal treatment of voters
4627506 the out of state groups behind this lawsuit failed to meet the minimum standards of public support for their unpopular agenda last year
4627507 the time for conversations has passed the time for concrete action has come
4627508 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4627509 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4627510 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4627511 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4627512 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4627513 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4627514 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4627515 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4627516 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4627517 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now

4627524 i didnt believe in bigfoot at the time ive seen the films and the things on television and you have to come to terms with it and realize that youve got something special
4627525 its like finding the biggest diamond in the world and having it in your possession
4627526 discovery its a hoax its a halloween costume in a box
4627527 theres a whole number of things that raise red flags in my opinion
4627528 we started to tell people the week after we found the body but no one believed us
4627529 so we started to make fun of the bigfoot trackers and that got attention
4627530 you type in bigfoot and thats the name that comes up
4627531 the army chief has told him musharraf very clearly that he will have to face the impeachment on his own the army will not be a party between him and the civilian government

4627533 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4627534 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

4627563 were always hopeful that well have qualified candidates to run in the open races
4627564 having a presidential race always increases voter turnout and interest
4627565 i think the key is the voice of michigan and florida is heard and theres a procedure that is fair to the residents and fair to the two candidates
4627566 it could not be a primary because a primary is publicly paid for and the taxpayers would not spend any more tax dollars on a primary so if theres anything it would have to be a caucus but wed have to have a way to pay for it without taxpayer dollars
4627567 i would not accept a caucus i think that would be a great disservice to the 2 million people who turned out and voted i think that they want their votes counted and you know a lot of people would be disenfranchised because of the timing and whatever the particular rules were
4627568 mccain well of course he said he wanted a timetable before that we have to understand that we lost the 2006 election and the democrats thought that they had a mandate they thought they had a mandate to get us out of iraq and i was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary in order to stand up for what i believed in now in december of 2006 after the election governor romney was wont weigh in im a governor

4627578 avalanche conditions have deteriorated in the duration of their trip thats not uncommon
4627579 he had a deep commitment to serving his country and was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice
4627580 dan believed deeply in the cause for which he was fighting
4627581 he died doing what he believed in what he believed god had created him to do and called him to do
4627582 to the families i am so sorry we did not bring your loved ones home
4627583 to the public keep these firefighters in your prayers the fire season has a way to go even as we are sitting here today there are battles raging in the forest
4627584 i know in my heart all his friends who died with him were living their prayer
4627585 but for the way they had lived they were pretty jazzed and happy because they held the lines and they loved helicopter rides
4627586 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in you lives
4627587 perhaps their gift will be saving the life of a future firefighter or helicopter pilot

4627589 thats when he shoots her three times and she fell to her knees and she was like travis what was that and hes like it was a cap gun the one that makes noise and she felt her neck and it was all bloody

4627613 oh you can download a program to do all that
4627614 1 day and i already got the phone back wow you saved the day
4627615 just a quick note to say you are a lifesaver cant believe how fast you shipped the iphone back
4627616 less than 2 days and my iphone is back and working perfect and feel free to use us as a reference
4627617 big thanks for all your help and getting the phone back so fast
4627618 these people leaving gannett contributed to its growth and success
4627619 we will thank them for their years of service and treat them in a way that acknowledges their valuable contributions
4627620 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4627621 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4627622 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4627623 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4627624 this is exactly what the law says and what it allows
4627625 if the republicans are trying to close the window they would be violating the law they wrote
4627626 absolutely right on this one it could be the best thing shes done in office
4627627 an illegal loophole in the state law to advance same day registration and voting which was never a consideration when the general assembly passed the law
4627628 this has nothing to do with denying people access to the ballot
4627629 the issue is about whether or not safeguards are in place
4627630 they are trying to deflect and confuse and suppress voters
4627631 this is walking down the path of scaring and intimidating voters and suppressing the vote in an important election year
4627632 our hope is that everyone will take a step back and work together in voters best interests to find solutions to these questions rather than fight it out with press releases and lawsuits public squabbling just leads to voter confusion
4627633 this is a recurring problem states have during every recession
4627634 there is good support for fiscal relief by several key members of congress such as rep john dingell d of michigan
4627635 but it all depends on whether congress does a second fiscal stimulus package and that is looking increasingly doubtful with president bush saying he would veto any more fiscal stimulus
4627636 you can define who to cover and how to set rates
4627637 many doctors were forced to stop seeing new medical patients or in some cases existing ones
4627638 the reimbursement rate for a regular 15 minute visit was 24 which is below the cost of providing care
4627639 that means an adult making 14 500 a year the equivalent of the minimum wage would not be getting healthcare
4627640 some of the rural hospitals are on the edge of bankruptcy
4627641 i had one rural hospital with 40 beds 39 of them for long term patients tell me they can go two more weeks before they have to shut their doors
4627642 some would have to cut back services others would be forced to close their doors
4627643 in the past it is my understanding the unions have been quite successful at blunting cutbacks
4627644 this is a case where the traditional foes the institutions and the workers are together on the same side and it multiplies the influence
4627645 its amazing how hard it can be to come up with 25 when everything is going up in price
4627646 most states will pretend their budgets are in balance until november
4627647 its hard to admit your budget is out of balance six weeks after you passed it
4627648 the measure in south dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families
4627649 they are being deceptive by characterising this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive
4627650 t he truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the united states
4627651 i think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life
4627652 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4627653 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4627654 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4627655 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4627656 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4627657 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4627658 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4627659 from my point of view this deal is not directed against russia
4627660 we will continue to advocate that talks be continued on how we can convince russia of this and also include it
4627661 this was a policy disagreement i had with administrator johnson who is in a very difficult situation
4627662 i respect the administrator though i do disagree with the policies he has pursued
4627663 i was invited back to epa to do a job and i did all this administration wanted me to do this administration has declined to decide what to do about the profound policy challenge of global warming this administration has decided to make itself irrelevant
4627664 i do not know what motivated him to say that he suddenly realized that this administration wasnt going to do anything
4627665 nobody knows for sure why he went public and started ratting out his colleagues
4627666 he was one of the political insiders at epa people on staff at epa are stunned that hes trying to rewrite history and say that he was a good guy all along
4627667 while he and i ultimately didnt agree on the right way to set an air quality standard
4627668 he liked how i operated he liked my expertise and experience in applying economic analysis to environmental policy making
4627669 it will have legal significance requiring epa to then issue the first federal greenhouse gas regulations i believe that much of the work we did will help the next administration
4627670 it was environmentally bad and flagrantly illegal on its face
4627671 he came into a lot of ill repute at the agency during the mercury battles
4627672 he was one of the principle architects for a policy that proved to be a total disaster from an air pollution standpoint
4627673 my basic philosophy of the regulation is fairly straight forward
4627674 some regulations are quite beneficial to the well being of our country and some of them arent ive tried to apply a consistent set of principles to each inquiry
4627675 was that administrator johnson declined to provide a stronger soot standard
4627676 california has met the test of the clean air act
4627677 sure hes giving corroboration that the leader of epa is a scoundrel
4627678 but whats being done about it the career epa staff people have been keeping their heads down for seven years they figure they might as well keep them down for another five months
4627679 because hes confirming what many of us have known for years that bush and cheney have been especially disastrous on environmental matters
4627680 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
4627681 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
4627682 were better at this than you people we have relationships where you often have none lets try to exercise the known and the knowable here so that we can bring at least some clarity to this debate
4627683 we have recently learned about british intelligence finding niger documents on uranium
4627684 we now know that there may be no wmd in iraq
4627685 well only a few people know about this i dont understand how you know clearly you do do you want me to talk about it confirm it
4627686 look 25 percent of us thought it was denial and deception
4627687 well well look for that one and well get back to you
4627688 hey these are the last days of this administration its over forget it whats the use of continuing the investigation
4627689 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
4627690 id bet my career on it everything was coming from those guys at this point go check this go do this some of it fanciful
4627691 well certainly in terms of specifically disinformation a lie they hadnt done the deception
4627692 but do you know specifically it was from the vice president
4627693 no what i know is it was from the white house
4627694 not within my chain of command was i told to fabricate
4627695 its ridiculous habbush isnt going to want to sign this thing hes too smart for that you know hes the intelligence chief of iraq hes a guy like us
4627696 were probably just going to have to fabricate it ourselves get someone to write it and then just deliver it
4627697 were probably just going to have to you know have somebody do it
4627698 i wish george had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea
4627699 well actually you know this is not the kind of thing that we would do on our own
4627700 this is a golden opportunity we have a window right into saddams inner circle through the intelligence chief habbush we can put anything through that window we can put misinformation through that window we can turn saddam in various directions we even can send habbush in with a team to take saddam out
4627701 imagine then we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad something that could save many american lives
4627702 my goodness american lives are at stake here youre cutting off the channel because you dont want to know more and we have to now go forward without the advantages and opportunities that habbush might have provided
4627703 we understand this is classified but we have people here who are charged to look at classified information in a kind of lockbox
4627704 well give it to you when were good and ready
4627705 they dont hold water in courts when there is the issue of wrongdoing
4627706 this is my business youre on a need to know basis ill tell you what i believe youre supposed to know
4627707 that is impossible that you would think that is an issue of national security
4627708 oh what can i do well you know where do i engage you know theyre the pros and im just going about my life
4627709 now wait a second i kind of own this government the way this works is im the sovereign the people theyre servants public servants
4627710 i have seen no coverage of rons allegations in the new york times i think such is important to legitimize the issues he raises has ron been contacted by the times why does he think there has been no coverage
4627711 how can i advance the story how can i find essentially my own fresh added corroboration added evidence essentially to what is clearly laid out in the book
4627712 these ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority
4627713 dont be afraid to say you are disappointed in fellow republicans dont hesitate to be anti washington d c

4627735 we must be about social transformation through culture and since culture is all that we do or not do we must intentionally create conditions time and space for the expansion of consciousness of ourselves and the citizenry by working with the collective imagination with ethics and aesthetics to promote the conscious choice to be planetary and global citizens
4627736 i am a poor little seamstress who was with you in la force
4627737 happily she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did in time to check herself and go back
4627738 i think it made me realize that everyone mentioned who was gone would be recalled this made me ready to suspect who mrs defarge was and the fact that dr mannettes past would come up somehow
4627739 i think he would be more bitter and cynical not bemussed and drunken when he says his lines
4627740 i care for no man and no man cares for me

4627744 children we are the lost flock you see every day that the wrath of the lord burns down around us because satan is fixin to lead us down the easy path the crooked path the path that winds around the world leading us to places where we can settle in and stop listenin for the good lords word

4627746 nettie aunt judith and uncle bud are family and what we do to our family we do to the lord do you want the lord to go hungry tonight
4627747 i know hell be such a good help with the baby
4627748 we are lost in the wilderness waiting for the voice of the lord to show us the way
4627749 they say oh that looks just like so and so
4627750 campbell said of her customers who love to try on the flamboyant hats
4627751 i think maybe one of your chicks is dead or about to die
4627752 what sucks is that i ate most of those calories
4627753 when they went up to a nickel my granddad was scared he would lose all of his business
4627754 were trying to come up with something different to bridge the generations
4627755 it was too cold to give him a trim in san angelo it was 21 degrees there yesterday
4627756 he places well in local shows but this is by far the biggest
4627757 he may not be the fastest but you know hes gonna be there on race day
4627758 once they open that door there is nothing you can do
4627759 you have to give them a good home take care of them and kind of spoil them to make them want to return home
4627760 i promise not to hit my brother or sister my dog or my cat and i have to whip outside
4627761 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
4627762 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4627763 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4627764 it was a little bit of pressure miller said smiling
4627765 the boys came out a little tight south dakota coach steve nolan said
4627766 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4627767 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise mcguire said his son hit third and went 1 for 2
4627768 it was there from the first lap the first turn vickers said after his lap of 188 536 mph put the red bull racing driver on the pole for sundays 3m performance 400
4627769 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all he added
4627770 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4627771 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota he said
4627772 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap johnson said
4627773 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4627774 thats a great team vickers said of johnson and his no
4627775 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4627776 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling the youngster said
4627777 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4627778 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4627779 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better said dechy who hasnt reached a semifinal since last augusts tier iv event at forest hills
4627780 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen wozniak said
4627781 if i would have had a little more focus i could have held serve and won the first set 6 3 but she has a lot of experience she was battling for every point even when she was down 5 2
4627782 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4627783 i was able to play my game in the second set and i guess she had trouble with it lusicki said
4627784 i was fighting it it still hurts ill have to get treatment on it and get ready for the u s open
4627785 i think this was my easiest match against her but i didnt exactly play my best petrova said
4627786 my returns werent working well and i had a little problem with concentration
4627787 im looking forward to getting some revenge on a different surface petrova said
4627788 she has all the physical tools to continue to progress to higher and higher levels said tom whittemore an assistant coach for the u
4627789 shes tall has long arms and legs and has great explosiveness
4627790 shes mature shes focused and she wants it said carroll vaughan johnsons club team coach
4627791 although it may not be as obvious because she is a goalie she also has great swim speed and an extremely strong throwing arm whittemore said
4627792 her and her brothers and sisters are always fighting donna johnson said
4627793 we fight for the front seat all the time but i dont always win ashleigh said
4627794 i dont think many african americans would just notice me playing on this level but hopefully i can get better so that it would bring more attention to it she said
4627795 i think if other african american people saw me playing then maybe they would try it out
4627796 its kind of like this old wives tail in swimming also that african americans had never been taught how to swim when they were little vaughan said
4627797 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4627798 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4627799 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4627800 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4627801 this course you can make a lot of birdies but its quite easy to have a few bogeys in there too
4627802 i kind of knew at the beginning of the week i thought it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges 8 irons 9 irons into par 4s
4627803 he has a cartilage injury of some sort we still dont know exactly how well progress from here what will be required
4627804 hell be re evaluated when we get back home i dont know how much longer than the normal dl it will take
4627805 we have confidence here are different people who can get the last out
4627806 we may have to bounce around a little well pay attention to matchups
4627807 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4627808 if i play good everything will take care of itself thats what im going to focus on just playing my round you know its my last tournament so i want to end on a good note hopefully ill be a really good one
4627809 they always have such a great golf course and always the condition of the golf course i realize this week is not easy because the rough is so long probably the longest rough of the year i think
4627810 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4627811 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4627812 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at

4627838 for many descendants of the original people of this land typically it has not mattered much who is in power at the white house ignoring treaty rights continued land loss high poverty levels poor health care corruption and in some cases little access to basic human rights remains with us regardless of who is in power we remain living under occupation conditions
4627839 sadly even though there are efforts to thwart the effects of occupation the purpose of colonization is having its desired effect to not only take the land and subdue the people but to change the worldview of the indigenous folks so they become agents of colonization themselves

4627842 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link

4627846 el mundo ha visto con inquietud c mo rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba a un gobierno elegido democr ticamente por su pueblo

4627850 we may do something later on thats a game type game organization type thing but not a live scrimmage
4627851 this will be the last really live scrimmage we will make as much game like as we possibly can we may do some situational stuff and substitution stuff but not actually football live type stuff later on so this will be the last scrimmage
4627852 statistically we didnt do very well in the red zone
4627853 and third down is just a matter everybody paying attention to detail so you can execute the passing game you have to be able to handle the blitz you have to be able to throw and catch it and you have to have people be able to separate in close coverage all those things we continue to work on and we have made significant progress in those areas how good we wont know until that first game
4627854 currently reading another one of those history books that depresses because all of humankind are savages be it for the
4627855 i dont see any place in either party where i make sense completely because look im a hunter im a fisherman right and i have bird dogs but i think there should be gun laws
4627856 i absolutely dont want to give up my guns and i want to go hunting
4627857 i even skin animals ok im an outdoorsman but i think theres too many guns i think that we should look at that differently and i think the nra should too so i know i dont fit there but i want to protect my guns too
4627858 i believe in a womans right to choose im a mixed bag so where do i fit you know i dont think bad of any of the candidates but i dont feel like i fit
4627859 these are the two best guys in america thats what our system is telling us
4627860 i have to choose between em and im telling you its probably going to come down to a feeling
4627861 im confused about this i am i dont know half full half empty
4627862 its not just people living in trailers who arent participating in the privilege to vote
4627863 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4627864 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4627865 we have staked our claim its use it or lose it for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north
4627866 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4627867 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4627868 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4627869 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4627870 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4627871 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4627872 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4627873 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4627874 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4627875 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4627876 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4627877 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4627878 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4627879 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4627880 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4627881 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4627882 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4627883 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4627884 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4627885 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4627886 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4627887 were done with beijing and are now off to guiyang it was the perfect start to a perfect trip before we go let me kinda recap what we saw

4627891 yeah well this motherfucker has apparently not yet made it around the block he still thinks he can stand on a scale and wait for a fucking miracle hes lucky he got off in time ill tell you what because i was going to tell that bastard that not only is he fat as hell but hes dumb as hell to boot get on get off get moving just because youre fat does not mean youve got to stop on top the scale and rest especially when youve got another fat bastard in a towel waiting behind you
4627892 to see whether apple would make believers out of us we pitted the imac against two intel based pcs a pricier pentium ii 400 system and a celeron based machine that costs about 300 less than the imac the results in its base 1299 configuration the imac finished last in each of our application tests the system was nearly as easy to use as the company claims but its poor performance means apple failed in its core mission

4627895 essentially potential growth paths for telecom operators rely on growing revenue share and growing the customer base and most preferably a mix of the two
4627896 as for extending scale operators must acquire and or pursue strategic alliances either with local or international players to create a much sought after critical mass

4627922 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect

4627925 we had our guys watching for hot spots until noon today and we had investigators on scene to determine the cause of the fire so far from evidence weve gathered the fire looks suspicious
4627926 the officers spotted the suspect on the street and just prior to arresting him on the outstanding warrant observed him making a drug sale to another person

4627935 the response in california to professional wet cleaning has been encouraging the cleaners in our professional wet cleaning commercialization program have eliminated the use of perc from their facilities
4627936 preliminary reports suggest that these facilities are seeing on average savings of over 650 per year in electricity costs with higher savings in equipment and maintenance costs
4627937 the sl 50 and sl 75 are the only commercial dryers made in the usa and among only a handful made worldwide that qualify for use with the environmentally sound professional wet cleaning process
4627938 the green philosophy behind professional wet cleaning dovetails nicely with adcs dry ecosmart initiative
4627939 we are thrilled to have two dryers that can assist dry cleaners in their conversion from the use of perc to an environmentally friendly process
4627940 the beauty of the s a f e system is that you can rest assured that your investment is protected from the damages caused by dryer fires
4627941 the minimal cost of the equipment upgrade to get a dryer with s a f e more than pays for itself in peace of mind and certainly in the event of a fire

4627950 since this gene version had similar structural effects in healthy children as in children with the disorder our findings suggest that adhd is at the far end of a continuum of normal traits
4627951 adhd likely stems from interactions between several such genes and non genetic factors
4627952 this study provides us with a first glimpse of how variation in a specific gene influences both brain development and clinical prognosis in adhd

4628052 the investigation has determined that spc messer was the victim of an accident caused by improper preventive maintenance checks and services not enemy fire
4628053 his combat patrol never struck an ied or received enemy fire at any point
4628054 if charlie doesnt get the purple heart he sure should get a marker that is right
4628055 the method of spc messers original injury does not reflect poorly on him or his family he deployed to a combat zone and prosecuted the war on terror with his brothers in arms this is more than the average young american has done and he is to be commended for his service

4628107 it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father

4628260 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4628261 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4628262 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4628263 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4628265 well i liked the way that we came out here today
4628266 i thought we came out fired up for practice and i thought that some groups really tried to take leadership and we gave great effort we need to practice smarter and stay off the ground but some of that is created because they are trying to impress their coaches and play with good effort we got a lot accomplished this morning

4628428 christian doctrine affirms that the created universe does have a real existence separate from god it has its own laws of operation as a result of gods creative action

4628438 it was my last year in college and i had opted out of the panel i had planned on going to america boston i had the j1 visa
4628439 then phillip got injured i was asked to come in to do a training session but sure they knew once i came in there was no way i was going to america from then on really
4628440 i was full back that day i suppose we just werent battle hardened even in our training games we werent geared up to it not compared to this year where we have 33 lads all fighting so that when the pressure came we werent able for it
4628441 it doesnt be long going even if we had won either of those munster finals though i dont know would we have had the belief to beat kilkenny cork had the set up kilkenny had the set up but the turning point for tipp was the 2002 all ireland semi final when we lost to kilkenny four points nicky english left tipp went down but it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if he had stayed on
4628442 i got injured in a club game missed the three games against limerick came back for the dublin game in the qualifiers got injured again a broken bone in my foot the first time then my jaw
4628443 i dont think about it now its so long ago its like it never happened
4628444 i thought i had lost teeth a big lump came out of it then i was trying to eat and i think it was larry corbett that said to me it was broken that was it for the season though i togged out against wexford it was a disappointing way to end the year a lot of bad vibes before and after it it wasnt a good way to finish up
4628445 myself and declan have a great relationship he got a break last year when i got injured he went in he was flying it then he kind of got injured this year and i got back in but the two of us get on very well
4628446 straight back to rosslare on the sunday night after every game an hour and a half from the college down to fishguard and then an hour and a half drive home after rosslare but i was lucky that i got my placement teaching practice in pembrokeshire for my last nine weeks that started seven weeks after christmas so it shortened the journey to fishguard by 40 minutes
4628447 id always be down pucking near the sea front theyd be looking at you very inquisitive theyd love it the welsh guys on the course would be looking up about it on the internet and the kids at the school were fascinated by it
4628448 they wanted to know more and more it shows you the possibilities that are there if you wanted to spread it but i just love the game when youre away from it all the hunger builds up to come home for it it helps to take a back seat have a look and get a perspective
4628449 a lot of fellas would have gone to college with the kilkenny lads so you would meet them over christmas or whatever and theyd have three or four all ireland medals in their pocket thats what it comes down to
4628450 its hard to say if its something well see replicated in other states

4628454 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
4628455 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
4628456 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
4628457 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
4628458 there are a few countries that will say told you so
4628459 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
4628460 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
4628461 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
4628462 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
4628463 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4628464 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4628465 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
4628466 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state

4628625 i learned so much about what it means to be a foreigner practicing law in china

4628638 es deprimente tanto para jefferson como para el equipo entero
4628639 el aniversario del terremoto es una oportunidad para que la gente diga que no se ve ning n avance eso es lo que dice el alcalde de pisco que no hay grandes obras eso no implica que no se est trabajando pero no hay la manera de demostrarlo parte del problema es que el gobierno est trabajando pero la gente no percibe eso el presidente debe cambiar su mensaje y asumir su discurso de 28 de julio que necesita m s modestia y serenidad su triunfalismo no est convenciendo a nadie
4628640 hay una serie de organizaciones que se han dedicado d a a d a a trabajar con los pisque os chinchanos pero lo mismo no se ve en el gobierno hay por ejemplo dos pisque os que han creado pisco sin fronteras que va a tomar la posta de organizaciones extranjeras que est n saliendo de la zona son ese tipo de personas que d a a d a reconstruye casas que se preocupan porque la ciudadan a tenga duchas y lugares d nde cocinar todo eso la gente percibe y pueden ver
4628641 no ve lo mismo en lo que hace el gobierno como los miles de bonos de seis mil soles que ha repartido hay un problema de percepci n pero tambi n radica en que el gobierno enfrent la crisis creando forsur en lima nombrando personas de lima y la percepci n es que b sicamente el gobierno actu por dos o tres semanas y luego lo dej todo a la deriva
4628642 est n construyendo casas comenzando a construir dos hospitales en pisco y colegios nuevos sin embargo entiendo el descontento y la desconfianza y creo que el principal problema es una falta de esperanza porque el presidente dijo que en seis meses se iba a reconstruir el sur incluso hubo cuestionamientos de lo que ofreci cuando despachaba en pisco y fue motivo de los roces con la prensa
4628643 ica es una zona del pa s donde ha habido crecimiento b sicamente liderado por el sector agroexportador que no fue afectado seriamente por el terremoto y el gobierno reconoce eso no ha hecho nada para los peque os productores si miramos en pisco se ten a alrededor de noventa hoteles ahora tiene menos de treinta todo turismo genera una cadena de valores econ micos que no est n funcionando la gente que ten a una bodega en su caso todo lo perdi y parte del problema es que debe enfocar ah donde puede empezar a generar

4628704 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4628705 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4628706 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4628707 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4628712 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4628730 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4628741 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4628742 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4628743 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of

4628774 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4628775 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4628776 all you people who are just now reading twilight youre not true fans
4628777 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them

4628779 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
4628780 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
4628781 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
4628782 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
4628783 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it

4628788 i may have an artist one day my rosters full i couldnt release him i may call pain you got room on nappy boy records or call kardi whats up with black jays you got room the whole vision was for all of us to always have an outlet
4628789 not for sale thats why you got the bar code over the mouth
4628790 what that represents is all my words all my music my feelings energy and passion i put in the music thats something that couldnt be swayed by the amount of money that a label would pay me at the end of the day any music you hear associated with kardinal offishall is because it means something to me this album is dope because kon allowed me to put it out there and he didnt want me just to stay in a certain lane
4628791 we took rick ross the boss record and just turned it to rudebwoy its just another day in the life a of real ruuuuude bwoyyyy put some auto tune on there the beat was killer from the first time i heard it the way the horns come in and the beat just drops like a new school paul revere you already know anything t pain touches turns to platinum i take my favorite joints even if the rappers are my peoples and i try to do it better
4628792 this was the first official reunion we had since we did the grindin remix
4628793 its produced by my first producer i signed with he goes by the name of the boy wonder soon as me pusha and malice heard the joint we were like we must destroy this i had a joint before thats called swag with myself pusha and lil wayne but out of respect and honor to the clipse i wanted to have a joint where it was just me and the brothers its just us three going in hard
4628794 this mixtape in particular its produced by myself and clinton sparks
4628795 clinton is also down with the konvict family its all a family movement i have a lot of new fans since dangerous but they need to know my history i didnt just come out of nowhere and on the intro clinton produced a timeline of what happened in my life to where i am now
4628796 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
4628797 i think its about time for us to really focus on the music business side of the game
4628798 i think we been doing a lot of street oriented underground catering
4628799 we do what we do and always stay true thats just the chemistry of the clipse stay true to what we are
4628800 i think were gonna open up to a wider audience but keep our same fans too
4628801 if you set up the album in the sense of moods
4628802 i can get some of that soul and some of them drums from sean c and lv i can get some of those stories from j u s t i c e league i dont know what im going to get from dj khalil he has something crazy you can tell they are bringing their a game to it
4628803 you can always rely on the neptunes to come with that old school sound
4628804 everybody is damn near on everything its a platform to showcase everybody and their own individual movements i want this to be a diving board the clipse jump off sandman liva everybody springboard off the situation and keep going
4628805 we got a song called money thats a great club banger
4628806 i think it shows us in a different light partying and having fun but the way we do it its one of the greatest things when you get around cats whose talent level is so high you gotta bring your a game i know theyre gonna bring their a game its great chemistry
4628807 whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4628808 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4628809 laughed rock who was just announced as a performer at this years vmas
4628810 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4628811 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4628812 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4628813 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4628814 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4628815 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh

4628840 you dont have to wonder the answer is none guns dont take lives the people wielding them do firearms are inanimate objects and contrary to popular myth are unable to parade around firing themselves at innocent people it takes a living breathing criminal to do that

4628869 i played for a coach who absolutely motivated out of fear
4628870 no one enjoyed going to practice no one looked forward to it everyone was scared
4628871 he was a great coach he got great results i had a great relationship with him and learned a great deal from him but that wasnt me were kind of the other extreme
4628872 and what is it that i would want from my leader my boss my coach its not so much about what i say but what they hear sometimes we get confused
4628873 motivate them in their best interest and theyll run through a wall for you
4628874 theres a lot of cheating in college sports probably a lot of cheating in business
4628875 i cant imagine a worse feeling than cheating to get a player then worrying for four years that someone might find out
4628876 i cant understand how someone could stand up before 15 players and talk about life skills and character about being honest if two or three of them are saying you cheated to get me
4628877 but i dont see any reason to say anything negative
4628878 leave people feeling special do that and people will want to be around you they look forward to being around you thats a good quality to have

4628884 lon is so good at it i dont think he did a lot of rehearsing either it was from the heart i could listen to him for hours
4628885 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
4628886 we dont know whether or not theres an effect in people
4628887 the acknowledged need for more research is an understatement bordering on irresponsibility

4628932 ministerul apararii nu produce nici un fel de armament nici nu am exportat nici arme si nici munitii in georgia o sa verificam daca pe linie comerciala au fost asemenea exporturi dar din cite cunosc eu nu s au exportat arme in zonele acelea daca a ajuns ceva inseamna ca a ajuns prin anumiti intermediari

4628936 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4628937 make sure that gen mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves

4628948 the people out there they are providing us with a lot of information because they want to kick the evil out of their neighborhoods because they want to live their normal lives
4628949 evident avind in vedere continutul si graba cu care a fost incheiat conditiile in care a fost semnat totul demonstreaza inca o data ca acest proiect nu are nici o legatura cu amenintarea rachetelor iraniene ci este indreptat impotriva rusiei
4628950 chiar daca nimeni nu recunoaste la nivel oficial acordul incheiat in graba este o replica la operatiunea dusa de rusia pe teritoriul georgian
4628951 in polonia faptul ca moscova si a trimis pentru prima oara tancurile si avioanele impotriva unui stat strain a fost luat foarte in serios
4628952 este unul dintre rezultatele razboiului care a fost inspirat de americani
4628953 este un esec pentru rusia dar si pentru germania franta si intreaga europa
4628954 statele unite demonstreaza ca au aliati siguri in timp ce rusia nu are aliati dupa acest razboi doar cuba a sustinut o
4628955 statele unite se ocupa de apararea antiracheta a propriului lor teritoriu nu al poloniei in timp ce polonia gazduind aceste elemente se expune la a fi atacata este suta la suta adevarat polonia devine tinta a unor contramasuri asemenea obiective sint distruse cu prioritate
4628956 se arata clar facem recurs la ea impotriva statelor care au armament nuclear impotriva aliatilor statelor care au armament nuclear daca le ajuta pe cele dintii si impotriva celor gazduiesc pe teritoriul lor arme nucleare ale altor state

4628959 in ultimele saptamini am fost tinta unei campanii de presa a trustului intact dusa in special prin intermediul postului antena 3 desi antena 3 a realizat mai multe emisiuni in care am fost subiectul discutiei eu nu am fost niciodata invitat consultat ori macar contactat aceste emisiuni sint catalogate in programul televiziunii ca fiind de dezbatere in fapt in ce ma priveste au fost emisiuni de demascare de infierare de stirnire a urii impotriva mea ca presedinte icr si a persoanei mele morale ca scriitor si intelectual public
4628960 motivul pentru care au fost prezentate a fost denuntarea mea ca element moral detracat ne roman si anti roman deopotriva personaj incompatibil cu pozitia pe care o ocup la icr acest lucru a reiesit clar din montajul emisiunii pe jumatate de ecran rulau imagini cu mine iar pe cealalta jumatate erau editate citatele incriminate comentate depreciativ la adresa mea de catre cei aflati in studio
4628961 o marturie veridica a convulsiilor sociale de la inceputul anilor 1990
4628962 dimpotriva citatele au fost prezentate ca reprezentind punctul meu de vedere de acum mai grav telespectatorii au ramas cu impresia ca aceste lucruri au fost declarate de mine ca presedinte al icr
4628963 in postura mincinoasa de fiu de nomenclaturist de vechi si inrait stalinist venit in romania cu tancurile sovietice

4628977 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4628978 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4628979 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4628980 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4629002 friday wow why so long do you have any earlier no uh
4629003 well we have some other repair shops who are willing to fix our tv earlier i was hoping you guys could come over today
4629004 ok between 2 amp 4 ok well see you then thanks
4629005 ah man tomorrow is going to seem like a week having to watch our tv
4629006 try calling just a few more places see if they can come over today
4629007 as i view it in every family a record should be kept of the immediate family the father the grandfather the great grandfather at least of those of whom we have a memory that record should be the first stone if you choose in the family altar it should be a book known and used in the family circle and when the child reaches maturity and gets out to make another household one of the first things that the young couple should take along should be the records of their families to be extended by them as life goes on it does no harm if there is duplication there is a strength an inspiration and a joy in having such a record near at hand to be used frequently the story of our ancestors their names the times in which they lived and something about their lives and accomplishments each one of us carries individually the responsibility of record keeping and we should assume it
4629008 get a notebook my young folks a journal that will last through all time and maybe the angels may quote from it for eternity begin today and write in it your goings and comings your deepest thoughts your achievements and your failures your associations and your triumphs your impressions and your testimonies remember the savior chastised those who failed to record important events
4629009 those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the lord in remembrance in their daily lives
4629010 what could you do better for your children and your childrens children than to record the story of your life your triumphs over adversity your recovery after a fall your progress when all seemed black your rejoicing when you had finally achieved
4629011 some of what you write may be humdrum dates and places but there will also be rich passages that will be quoted by your posterity
4629012 get a notebook a journal and maybe the angels may quote from it for eternity
4629013 having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of god therefore i make a record of my proceedings in my days
4629014 and i know that the record which i make is true and i make it with mine own hand and i make it according to my knowledge
4629015 every important event in our lives should be placed in a record by us individually if you have accomplished something worth while during the day put it down it may be of use to posterity
4629016 may i suggest that you write that you keep journals that you express your thoughts on paper you will bless the lives of many your families and others now and in the years to come
4629017 there is something eternal in the very nature of writing as is so graphically illustrated by the scriptures themselves in a very real sense our properly written histories are a very important part of our family scripture and become a great source of spiritual strength to us and to our posterity
4629018 i personally believe that the writing of personal and family histories will do more to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the fathers to children than almost anything we can do
4629019 your story should be written now while it is fresh and while the true details are available
4629020 write about your goings and your comings your deeper thoughts your achievements and your failures your associations and your triumphs your impressions and your testimonies
4629021 those who keep a personal journal are more likely to keep the lord in remembrance in their daily lives
4629022 earlier i would meet a pretty girl in the office and try to strike up a conversation it would take considerable effort to cut through her airs and graces and get talking the topic of the conversation would be a pain to me but i would pretend to enjoy every moment after a few days she would be ready to go out for coffee this would be followed by a mind numbing movie then another round of coffee a month would have passed by now i would still be in hot pursuit a few weekends later would come the big day for dinner after the dinner i would chivalrously drop her home and the next day just when i would expect my big moment to come i would find her chatting animatedly with the idiot from marketing what a waste of effort
4629023 many a times you do succeed and you also end up making love but then very quickly you also fall out of love and start fancying other girls and then it gets damn difficult to break free from the woman
4629024 its being unfair to the woman you know you are in it for sex so why keep up the pretense why not go straight for the nookie by paying for it
4629025 the sort of young man of whom most mothers would approve
4629026 it is difficult for a woman to understand what it is that a prostitute can offer these perfectly attractive men that a free sexual encounter cannot
4629027 conversations with friends and acquaintances reveal that quite a few of them are paying for sex
4629028 flirting used to be and still is the norm when it comes to interaction between men and women at the workplace but in my previous organization there was this guy who just did not interact with the women apart from in a strictly professional capacity i found his behavior a bit odd it emerged gradually that he believed in hard work and earning good money he did not believe in asking women out in forging relationships or in love he preferred chasing exotica he would go on planned sex tours abroad
4629029 in my institute the boys are out to get the prettiest girls while the girls are out to get the guys with the best bikes best mobiles and rich dads and theres no such thing as love so if some men have stopped being hypocritical whats wrong with it
4629030 that though men appreciate the needs of women women dont of men they expect us to listen to and understand everything they say but dont realize they are driving us crazy women simply rob you of your happiness so why shouldnt men make the dealing straight
4629031 not only for sexual activities that their partners do not provide but also to fulfill certain psychological needs such as the need for intimacy and excitement
4629032 when my son grows up i will expect him to have fun too

4629035 congratulations to you and the whole indian team for winning this world cup you guys have produced a great nail biting show and deserve the cup we welcome you to share the joy with us
4629036 thanks ravi the match was pretty close encounter between two great teams and our guys held the nerve to win the game and cup
4629037 all us played well but i would say the main reason and man behind this great victory is ajit agarkar
4629038 agarkar how come agarkar he didnt play in the final
4629039 yepp thats the reason we won this low scoring match if he could have bowled in final pakistan would have scored the winning runs from his 4 overs
4629040 the team doctor deserves the credit he really helped us to prepare for the final
4629041 is it how the doctor helped to prepare for the final he is not the coach or physical trainer dhoni i am getting confusion
4629042 ravi nothing to confuse he has failed sehwag in the fitness test according to our game plan and we managed to pick a good playing team thus we weigh the doctors contribution as very high infact its better than our team effort in the field our game tactics worked well
4629043 the entire team including myself wants to dedicate this cup to sachin dravid and ganguly
4629044 i really really appreciate you its good that you have so much respect to the seniors and you
4629045 ravi let me complete india would have exited in the group matches if they decided to play in the series thank god they opted out and we managed to play cricket and won the cup
4629046 the match was thrilling encounter and was concluded by a single mistake of misbah
4629047 yes you are right after lofting the ball misbah told me that he has sent the ball to where there was no one

4629060 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4629061 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4629062 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4629063 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4629064 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4629065 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4629066 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics

4629070 dupa ce mi am luat un opel astra second hand din olanda am facut autorizarea provizorie pe 13 iulie inainte sa imi expire numerele rosii la 12 august am reusit cu greu sa imi fixez o intilnire cu cei de la rar pentru ca la telefon nu raspundea nimeni iar pe internet apareau erori in formularul de programare dupa doua saptamini de incercari abia pe 8 august am reusit sa ma programez prima data disponibila fiind 8 octombrie pina atunci trebuie sa merg cu tramvaiul
4629071 sint printre putinii naivi care mai cred ca institutiile statului sint facute pentru a ajuta problemele cetatenilor dar ma intreb totusi pe noi cine ne apara de aceste institutii
4629072 la rar s a facut tot ce s a putut s a prelungit programul si s a suplimentat numarul de angajati cei care vor sa li se restituie diferenta de taxa auto sa ia o pauza nu e nici o graba pentru ca nu s a stabilit nici un termen pina la care se pot lua banii la rar e o situatie generala fiind monitorizata la nivel national un program special gen o zi cei cu prime inmatriculari o zi cei cu taxa de poluare si asa mai departe poate fi instituit de autoritatea centrala acel ordin de guvern creaza un cerc vicios chiar daca s ar face inca un rar tot nu s ar face fata situatiei
4629073 verificam cam 190 de automobile pe zi cel mai mult dureaza inmatricularile masinilor second hand acestea fiind chiar si 50 pe zi in plus la noi deja vin si masini din judetele botosani si suceava

4629075 asta inseamna citeva miliarde bune de euro care in final ar trebui sa produca in 4 ani de guvernare in sfirsit ceea ce noi toti asteptam kilometri de autostrada kilometri de drumuri nationale reparatii de poduri drumuri si asa mai departe altfel daca nu se vor aloca bani multi deodata nu vom putea sa asteptam imbunatatirea infratsructurii rutiere
4629076 se va continua cu 6 din pib pe ceea ce inseamna educatie dar pentru prima oara introducem 6 din pib si pentru infrastructura tocmai pentru ca rezultatele sa inceapa sa se vada produsul intern brut va creste sigur noi in 2005 2008 am avut patru prioritati unele dintre ele au inceput sa se rezolve unele sint pe drumul care trebuie de exemplu reparatia de scoli s au bagat bani multi stiti foarte bine se va continua cu campusuri si asa mai departe

4629078 in urma dezbaterii initiate de ojpc iasi cu privire la oportunitatea inchiderii operatorului economic rds amp rcs un numar covirsitor de cetateni ai judetului in incercarea de a apara operatorul economic rcs amp rds au aruncat indoieli asupra comportamentului ojpc in relatia cu e on moldova acuzind o posibila intelegere intre aceste doua institutii constatind o tensiune in rindul consumatorilor ieseni si constientizind ca masuri de genul inchiderii activitatii unui distribuitor de energie electrica asa cum prevede legislatia in cazul abaterilor repetate ar fi aberante solicit cetatenilor activi ai judetului solutii adecvate pentru scaderea gradului de insatisfactie in rindul consumatoruilor adresa de e mail la care asteptam sugestiile iesenilor este iasi inspectorat anpc ro
4629079 in cazul reclamatiilor neintemeiate predomina urmatoarele aspecte suspiciunea ca inregistrarile aparatelor de masurare a energiei electrice contor ar fi eronate fapt contrazis de verificarile metrologice de specialitate in plus defectarea aparatelor electrocasnice din cauza deranjamentelor de furnizare a energiei electrice nu poate fi dovedita de noi iar trecerea la noul mod de facturare a determinat confuzie cu privire la calculul facturii pe luna
4629080 cresterea numarului de consumatori casnici a determinat o suprasolicitare a retelei electrice in anumite zone generind intreruperi de energie electrica in plus fenomenele naturale au determinat defectari ale retelei de distributie la care se adauga incidente create de interventia in unele lucrari de catre alti furnizori de utilitati

4629148 our interpretation of the results is that they were very very favorable for our device
4629149 in no test did we ever declare a channel vacant when there was a wireless microphone on it
4629150 there was never an issue of the white space device creating interference
4629151 there were some cases where we were outside the contours of a particular channel and the mast antenna showed a picture even though it was outside the contour
4629152 it was never a case that a signal was viewable
4629153 we believe that they confirm that sensing works and is adequate in protecting incumbents from white space devices
4629154 its not surprising that theyre saying that but from what were hearing they were absolutely not a success
4629155 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
4629156 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
4629157 we will be submitting and demonstrating the wireless microphone beacon next week
4629158 so that they can study and understand the device but whether and what type of tests or analysis are conducted is not clear and will be up to the fcc
4629159 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions
4629160 the fcc has the opportunity to unleash new innovative devices and services into the marketplace while at the same time protecting broadcasters and wireless microphones from harmful interference
4629161 we have been reminded several times lately that web 2 0 is in no way a synonym for reliable major services have crashed big product launches have fizzled users have raised their collective fists in the air whats going on is the web crumbling well no its not but users expectations are rising and web companies often get themselves into trouble by promising far more than they can deliver

4629270 perhaps the group has been hijacked by elements in other countries and other muslim societies and not all of them may be but some of them have become misguided and radical

4629275 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4629276 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4629277 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement

4629299 we got more information out of a german general with a game of chess or ping pong than they do today with their torture
4629300 during the many interrogations i never laid hands on anyone
4629301 we extracted information in a battle of the wits im proud to say i never compromised my humanity
4629302 being held at the fairmont hotel in san jose ca in which he will distill the unique characteristics of clouds and describe how to best think about deployments in the clouds
4629303 the best part of ruby on rails is the community
4629304 eu estou apenas estudando ror ja fiz curso e sou apenas um
4629305 there is no doubt that the lawsuit was not to harass or cause the defendants problems but rather it was to get them to participate in a problem that was being confronted by the people of this state
4629306 the attorney general made a choice to accept the costs associated with this lawsuit when he filed it
4629307 preposterous that these corporations that a jury found poisoned tens of thousands of kids in our state would attempt to get money from those who tried to hold them responsible
4629308 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4629309 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4629310 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4629311 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4629312 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4629313 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4629314 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4629315 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4629316 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4629317 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4629318 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4629319 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4629320 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4629321 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4629322 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4629323 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4629324 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4629325 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4629326 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4629327 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4629328 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4629329 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4629330 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4629331 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4629332 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4629333 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4629334 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4629335 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4629336 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4629337 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4629338 this is a planning took where all things are going
4629339 usaid pergilah kepada kedua orang itu dan cegahlah mereka untuk membuat kekacauan di tempat ini sebab aku masih memiliki hubungan keluarga dengan asad bin zurarah sehingga aku enggan bertemu dengannya
4629340 apakah kedatangan kalian berdua di daerah ini akan mengacau ketenangan yang ada apakah kalian akan menghasut orang banyak untuk melawan kami oleh karena itu jika kalian masih sayang dengan jiwa kalian kami meminta untuk segera meninggalkan tempat ini
4629341 apakah engkau dapat duduk sebentar saja apabila engkau mau menerima ajaran ini silakan diterima dan jika tidak suka boleh engkau tolak
4629342 sungguh amat bagus ajaran al quran yang engkau baca itu bagaimana caranya aku masuk ke dalam agamamu
4629343 jika engkau masuk islam terlebih dulu engkau harus mandi lalu bersihkan pakaianmu setelah itu engkau membaca syahadat dan menunaikan shalat
4629344 aku mempunyai teman yang jika orang itu mau menerima ajaranmu pasti akan diikuti orang banyak
4629345 demi allah aku yakin usaid datang dengan wajah yang berlainan dengan wajahnya tadi sewaktu dia berada di tengah tengah kalian
4629346 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4629347 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4629348 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4629349 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4629350 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4629351 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4629352 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4629353 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4629354 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4629355 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4629356 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4629357 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4629358 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4629359 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4629360 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4629361 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4629362 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4629363 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4629364 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4629365 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4629366 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4629367 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4629368 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4629369 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4629370 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4629371 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4629372 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4629373 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4629374 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4629375 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4629376 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4629377 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4629378 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4629379 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4629380 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4629381 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4629382 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4629383 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4629384 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4629385 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4629386 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4629387 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4629388 he said that russia will implement the agreement faithfully the state department official who asked not to be named told a few journalists before a stopover in shannon
4629389 immediately saying that was what moscow had committed itself to do
4629390 the body of a person was located at the rear of the house and forensic examination will be used to identify it police said in a statement
4629391 a woman suffering severe burns was also located inside the house and she was taken to liverpool hospital before being transferred to concord hospital she is in a critical condition
4629392 the body of a person was located at the rear of the house and forensic examination will be used to identify it amp squo amp squo police said in a statement
4629393 a woman suffering severe burns was also located inside the house and she was taken to liverpool hospital before being transferred to concord hospital she is in a critical condition amp squo amp squo
4629394 world harp you say that the channel isnt founded on the world but you know as well as i do that it is
4629395 im going to ask them questions about character competence about values vision virtue about their convictions in leadership about their experience and im going to deal with their personal life because character matters their personal life does matter as a leader god says so
4629396 luchar contra el imperialismo donde quiera que est esto reconforta y cura con creces cualquier desgarradura
4629397 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4629398 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4629399 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4629400 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4629401 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4629402 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4629403 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4629404 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4629405 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4629406 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4629407 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4629408 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4629409 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4629410 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4629411 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4629412 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4629413 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4629414 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4629415 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4629416 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4629417 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4629418 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4629419 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4629420 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4629421 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4629422 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4629423 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4629424 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4629425 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4629426 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4629427 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4629428 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4629429 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4629430 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4629431 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4629432 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4629433 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4629434 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4629435 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4629436 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4629437 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4629438 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4629439 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4629440 do you ever wonder if youre a good kisser maybe we should kiss our friends more often and they can tell us
4629441 a man shall not lay down in bed with another man
4629442 nagulat ako sa galing ng mga kalaban ko ganito pala ang olympic games my score is a disaster in these games i could have done better but i lack experience competing against the veterans some of whom are in their fourth or fifth olympics
4629443 babalik ako at sisiguraduhin kung tatalunin ko silang lahat pagbalik ko
4629444 bata pa siya pupwede pa siya ng tatlong olympic games at sisiguraduhin kong makakabalik siya sa susunod na olympic games huwag lang siyang mag aasawa

4629449 i will have to start preparations early like two to three years before the next olympics
4629450 it was his chance to see kobe bryant and the rest of the nba superstars i guess the president didnt want to disappoint him
4629451 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4629452 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4629453 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4629454 barely budged from governing alone territory in our fairfax media nielsen poll
4629455 i think he felt he was defending a womans integrity

4629458 simpler is better and rest is generally simpler than soap
4629459 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4629460 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4629461 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4629462 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4629463 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
4629464 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4629465 i know im going to win for sure otherwise i would have stayed home and watched it on tv
4629466 today another step has been taken towards cementing peace and strengthening cultural ties between the two great neighbours
4629467 we are honoured to be invited to join the celebrations of anniversary of indias independence i wish you border troops all prosperity and hope for a stronger bond between two great armies
4629468 this occasion today presents another great opportunity to strengthen and further resolve the peace and tranquility along the border we have made tremendous progress in past years in maintaining the sanctity of the border such occasions and interaction between the two armies will help further strengthen the ties between the two countries
4629469 i am very happy about the way your people and army officials are taking care of us i am enjoying it very much
4629470 this is a very very tough call and this was not a decision that was made because you know what i dont like fan fan is not treating me well mike and me are fighting thats not it
4629471 i just thought right now it was time to try a little something different
4629472 i said i would never have another partner and i wont that is not the idea
4629473 the idea is for me to have some folks along who can offer some opinions have some fun offer some different perspectives and some personality and i am looking forward to it

4629486 when you look at whats happened in the airline industry whats happened with airports for the last few decades you see that there are some peaks and some valleys i think this is a valley

4629488 i go to some shows that are maybe 400 miles away its convenient to fly but if i have to drive i will
4629489 this was written by someone really wise and its really old

4629495 i made a couple of birdies today but i still had an awful lot of chances and im still just not letting it loose
4629496 i had a number in mind today i wanted to be under par at least get us back to even par and at even par for the tournament then i was going to be able to give it a run tomorrow and the next day im not here to make cuts anymore im here to win golf tournaments thats just the way that is
4629497 i know ive got a couple of low rounds in me and i can have a good finish

4629504 i am the rabbit i am the rabbit i swear
4629505 csis always has a booth when our university or student union does job fairs and similar activities its actually kind of sad though they do tend to attract more traffic than your average summer house painting gig whether our espionage service should be competing with such outlets is another question
4629506 what about the a team putting an end to jibba jabba one fool at a time
4629507 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4629508 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through

4629511 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4629512 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4629513 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4629517 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4629518 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4629519 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4629520 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4629521 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4629522 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4629523 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4629524 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4629525 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4629526 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4629530 in big cities like beijing guangzhou and shanghai in particular people are very keen to engage in sports

4629532 we are trying to get the government to require schools to open up their campus sports facilities to the public when the students are not using them just like they do in other countries
4629533 its hard to find a place to play badminton and its either too sunny or windy with an indoor gym we can come anytime we like
4629534 now consider human lives their every minute every day lives their lives depend upon an agreed regularity to which each contributes maintaining this regularity is the forgotten practice im talking about
4629535 it explains the arrival of the fruit in the market each day the lights in the street at night the letters slipped under the front door the matches in a match box all pointing in the same direction music heard on the radio smiles exchanged between strangers
4629536 no place for illusions here the beat doesnt stop solitude it doesnt cure pain you cant telephone it its simply a reminder that you belong to a shared story
4629537 and in our life today we are condemned to endless irregularity those who impose this on us are frightened by our irregularity so they build walls to keep us out

4629554 by prohibiting mandatory overtime new york states hospitals and health care facilities will be able to provide a greater quality of care to its patients
4629555 additionally this legislation will allow our facilities to retain and recruit a vital nursing workforce which is necessary to maintain the high standard of health care that new york provides

4629561 sssssst we zijn op een fluisterboot met hoge kaplaarzen aan en gewapend met paraplus en regenjassen loopt een groepje kinderen met hun ouders opas en omas de met zeil overdekte boot de sterling op
4629562 ik vind het heel leuk om zo met een boot te varen zegt ze
4629563 dat is heel goed voor het milieu zegt ze wijs loeka zit een beetje weggedoken in haar regenjas om de regendruppels te ontwijken
4629564 de boot vaart hier al jaren vertelt marianne den braven van het biesboschcentrum dordrecht
4629565 maar mensen wisten van tevoren vaak niet dat de tocht die ze gingen doen ook met een geruisloze boot was daarom hebben we er nu een hele excursie van gemaakt
4629566 het is jammer dat het zulk slecht weer is zegt van iperen
4629567 je merkt toch dat er dan een stuk minder mensen komen
4629568 een vraag van de speurtocht is bijvoorbeeld hoe mensen daar vroeger aan energie kwamen op de vragen bestaan eigenlijk geen goede of foute antwoorden het gaat erom dat de kinderen worden gemotiveerd om over energie na te denken en dat iedereen gewoon een leuk dagje uit heeft
4629569 het is vakantieperiode en we willen ook gewoon die kinderen een leuke dag bezorgen
4629570 but why wont we show enough of it in our broadcasts

4629573 in hansweert te kunnen afleveren het schip dat de laatste jaren in scheveningen dienst heeft gedaan is dan geheel gereviseerd en kan weer een aantal jaren mee
4629574 en die vallen hoger uit dan in eerdere jaren maar dat hoeft niet te betekenen dat er meer gestolen wordt dat weten we de komende jaren pas
4629575 het wordt gezegd ja dat ze centraal te werk gaan maar ik schat in dat zeker dertig procent van de aangiftes heel laat bij de klpd terechtkomt en er zijn er bij die het nooit halen aangifte doen gebeurt nog steeds in een gewoon politiebureau de klpd blijft afhankelijk van de regios
4629576 het zou heel wat schelen wanneer die boten en motoren geregistreerd waren maar dat komt maar zelden voor eenvoudigweg omdat het niet hoeft jachten en dure boten worden nog wel eens bij het kadaster beschreven als onroerend goed waardoor de eigenaar er ook een hypotheek op kan nemen zon schip staat dan wel daar geregistreerd
4629577 een kulargument natuurlijk want dat hadden ze ook via een vignet kunnen regelen
4629578 ook die zijn te vervalsen een dief kan van tevoren een registratienummer aanvragen
4629579 ook het zogenaamde y nummer voor de snelle boten is niet veilig bijna altijd zijn het simpel te verwijderen plakletters
4629580 en dat lukt meestal binnen drie maanden de boten d e teruggevonden worden bevinden zich meestal nog binnen een straal van dertig kilometer

4629582 iedere gemeente vindt het schitterend om in de vorm van water een mooie toeristische trekpleister te hebben maar dan moet je ook zorgen voor veiligheid als ons werk straks overgenomen zou moeten worden door de reguliere hulpdiensten dan gaat dat de samenleving op jaarbasis tonnen of misschien wel miljoenen euros meer kosten
4629583 het zou wel zo eerlijk zijn om niet n gemeente voor de kosten te laten opdraaien
4629584 behoorlijk wat posten lukt het niet om doordeweeks het rooster rond te krijgen dan zijn er alleen in het weekend strandwachten aanwezig terwijl het op een heel zonnige doordeweekse dag in de zomervakantie ook hartstikke druk kan zijn

4629625 the 6 year old brother was handing a gun to his 15 year old brother so it could be put away on a gun rack
4629626 its a very tragic situation and these kids were familiar with guns so it shows an accident can happen at any point in time and guns need to be taken very seriously
4629627 they should make sure their kids know somewhat about the guns and if the kids are handling the guns that they know the safe way to handle a gun and to make sure that its unloaded

4629648 boards never make big moves and eliminate risk through an excessive focus on what they cannot do
4629649 the board must increasingly play an active part in key decision making management must move from being a provider of data and information to being a provider of knowledge to the board

4629660 alright its true that i feel such although like you said we are the same so i know you feel it too and yet we cannot have what we wish
4629661 i just wish to touch you again with bare hands
4629662 wish we could touch perhaps we can descend again soon
4629663 slay me we will both fade and be reborn you know how much he loves a good game and this is the only idea i could think of

4629665 i dont want to do this and you know we could go back and end up hating each other give me time please
4629666 once i couldnt be taken from your arms but now i cant even reach out to you

4629669 even if we wind up as enemies i would do it over and over just for the sight of your eyes on mine my zes
4629670 i love you too much dont know why we have to do this to be together are we doing this now or soon

4629675 i cant wait for it to start ive had a smile on my face all week just thinking about it theres nothing like the first day of the season its a carnival atmosphere
4629676 everythings gone well on a personal level and a team level but that was pre season all the settling in and getting to know each other the real work starts on saturday
4629677 youve got to hit the ground running but weve put ourselves in the best shape possible and weve got the right attitude
4629678 middlesbrough will graft they do work hard and its always a difficult place to go because they will come at us
4629679 if we go out with the right mentality its a game we should win but weve got to be winning every game so its just another game in the fixture list that were looking to win
4629680 theyre one of those teams against whom i seem to do well and touch wood hopefully that continues
4629681 pre season was a long hard process of just shy of 50 days preparation so i think were arriving at the first game of the season in excellent condition
4629682 weve had a reasonably good series of results and i think were going to the riverside full of confidence
4629683 the league is totally different kettle of fish because youre playing against sides battling for the points just like yourselves and teams go into these matches in a much more serious manner
4629684 but i would like to think that were ready not just for boro but any team that we come across in the coming weeks
4629685 we feel good at the moment but we all realise pre season is totally different to the start of the season
4629686 in previous years weve had good pre seasons and not started that well when it matters so our focus is on the start of the season and getting three points at middlesbrough
4629687 any first game of the season is tough especially away from home middlesbrough will be up for it their fans will be right behind them and well have to be at our best to get anything out of it
4629688 weve said all along that the start is vital we got off to a poor start last season and found it difficult to get back its tough putting back to back wins together in this league
4629689 this time around we want to get off to a good start and maintain it

4629720 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4629737 my first choice would have been to fire craig foss but crown counsel advised me that might be shaky legally then i got a call from hdc ceo mcleod who clearly impressed me as an overworked underpaid civil servant and the stories he told me about lawrence yules constant meddling in council affairs were appalling my conscience told me i needed to back ross up
4629738 i was listening to the other local ceos in our ceo support group and realised how insufferable lawrences micro managing had become my god once he actually asked to see the budget and another time he refused to authorise my fact finding trip to fiji to study their sustainability practices he claimed sustainability was his turf bullcrap i have more knowledge about sustainability in my little toe than that borne again environmentalist has in his entire body
4629739 ceo neil taylor of napier said to me dont be a wuss i would never let barbara arnott push me around like that and regional council ceo newman advised ive learned that if they wont let you lead them around by the nose cut em loose or bury them in futures planning
4629740 but the real clincher was when dhb ceo chris clarke the terminator agreed to be my chief strategist for the firing campaign hell be starting right after his mental stress leave
4629741 before lawrence was able to use his new position to promote stronger authority for local elected officials that could shift the whole balance of power from clever bureaucrats to elected dilettantes with terrible repercussions for the quality of local government throughout new zealand just look what happened when the elected deputy chairman of the regional council got in over her head with tukituki water consents
4629742 everyone knows just look at the dhb that ceos and their staffs are supposed to run the show what in blazes do elected officials know about anything
4629743 im gratified that were solvent and can now pay sam kelt all those back fees we owe him for the benevolent deed hes doing for hastings
4629744 i had even given ross my own office suite to use as ceo taking only a small room for myself in the basement what treachery
4629745 i never ever call a council meeting or sign a contract without ross blessing i even told him i would cancel the sports park tomorrow full stop if he thought it was a loser i turn in my official car mileage records to him he decides the menu for our council tea i gave him more rope than murray gilbertson what more power could he want

4629755 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante

4629835 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4629836 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4629837 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4629838 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4629839 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors

4629843 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages

4629846 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4629847 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4629848 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4629875 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4629876 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4629877 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4629878 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4629879 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4629880 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4629881 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4629882 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies

4629884 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4629885 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4629886 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4629887 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4629888 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4629889 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4629890 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4629891 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4629892 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4629893 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4629894 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4629896 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

4629900 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4629901 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

4629903 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4629904 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4629905 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4629906 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4629907 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4629908 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4629909 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4629910 its amazing that all those people came out and helped
4629911 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4629912 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
4629913 no offence was intended by the advert but whether the chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for spanish sport
4629914 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4629915 members of the madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the guardians accusation exists a plan by certain people in the anglo saxon world to dirty spains name over their bid for the games
4629916 it seems that no one read the original i didnt accuse anyone of anything
4629917 in bad faith by some members of the press so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action
4629918 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4629919 i would like to say that we have a huge respect for the orient and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china and one of our spanish national team sponsors is the chinese brand li ning
4629920 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4629921 but we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever so as far as we are concerned the matter rests
4629922 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the us there would be suspensions
4629923 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4629924 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing
4629925 and dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4629926 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation that takes place
4629927 and if my alarm clock goes off in the morning it means we havent lost an officer overnight
4629928 my basic point has always been if you cant take the heat dont apply for the job but these are hugely challenging events which is where leadership is always tested if you take a senior position expect to be under the spotlight
4629929 when they found that head there was a big deal in town
4629930 there are many people who know a lot but they do not want to talk because they dont like it
4629931 when he met the ladies he kissed their hands he would open doors for them american guys dont do that
4629932 i was surprised how many smart people in san marino looked up to him
4629933 there was something wrong with the guy he was a flaky guy his story shifted and changed
4629934 was that he said he was working in film and television but when i asked how many tv sets he had he said i dont own a tv i dont like it
4629935 but how can you be that plausible a con artist is a con artist
4629936 he lived in a separate house in the back and dealt mostly with the mother his landlord
4629937 is not ready to exercise its authority under and impose it
4629938 indication of a legal tie of allegiance between the moroccan sultan and some of the tribes of the territory
4629939 the good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks
4629940 a global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year
4629941 typically the majority of the firms hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off
4629942 i just ran the first 50 metres then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4629943 im ready for my best i just came to run and do what i can do i got my stride back
4629944 i felt good and relaxed i just wanted to make it through
4629945 there were four other good sprinters in that race so i knew i needed a good start and then i could see what i could do
4629946 ive been working on my first 30 metres and it all came together at the right time
4629947 and he really thought i was mocking him he told me how hed spent his life trying to get out of this place and now here was his grandson his rich successful american grandson paying a huge amount of money to go back
4629948 its the most written about place in the world the first job anyone ever had getting off a boat was as a trouser cutter in a lower east side sweatshop the second job was writing a novel about being a trouser cutter in a lower east side sweatshop the literature could fill a library but while it was my story it also wasnt my story so i sort of left it alone and it has taken me a long time to come back to it
4629949 a better fictional account of the dark side of the american dream in years
4629950 probably the best novel written on the dope culture in inner city america price is both an artist and consummate pro
4629951 no one writes better dialogue than richard price not elmore leonard not david mamet not even sopranos creator david chase
4629952 descriptive eye as acute as his moral one for no american writer has ever written with such consistent power as price on the subject of shame of the failure of good intentions of life as lived in the gap between intention and act
4629953 if youd said the word boutique to my grandfather hed have assumed it was a french word for a whore or something
4629954 i didnt know there were still housing projects filled with black and hispanic people tenements untouched by the rehab craze orthodox jews old hippies who came down in the 60s and the biggest chunk of undocumented chinese workers in the country they live like the jews did in 1890 with overcrowded rooms every penny they make going either to the smuggler who brought them in or the family in the old country
4629955 and behind the identical fa ade were the creaky wooden staircases the rats running round and dozens of rooms in which chinese guys rent a plank of wood as wide as a library shelf on which they sleep that was the lower east side worlds literally inches away from each other and yet entirely separate i wanted to write about how these different groups of people occupy the same physical space but seem not to even see each other
4629956 i was aware that these were very rare events its happened twice in 10 years but when theres a gun there has to be a conversation and then the investigation can legitimately enter all the worlds down there to come to a conclusion it gave me access
4629957 and there but for the grace of god go i
4629958 if i hadnt got published at 24 i really dont know whether i would have stuck at it into my 30s i was the first college graduate in my family and the last thing they would have understood was their child saying i want to be a dancer would i have stuck at telemarketing or driving a cab to support my writing habit while my cornell friends were lawyers i really dont know thank god its hypothetical
4629959 blue collar racially mixed punch on the nose at worst housing project just as the lower east side was a starter kit for the new world so public housing was a starter kit for a respectable working class life it was affordable rents for not so bad apartments so people spent all their money on getting the next generation to college and it worked pretty well as a launching pad until well into the 1960s when for many reasons the projects stopped being seen as a step up
4629960 i remember being a kid in his house in brooklyn and seeing his name at the end of a poem which i knew was a poem only because the lines seemed to end arbitrarily and i saw my father looking at his father with real reverence writing was something i wanted to do
4629961 some parts of cornell are easier to get into than others
4629962 i didnt give a damn about any of it but in retrospect im glad i wasnt an english major spending all day talking about tolstoy and then going home to write your 19 year old crap it would be demoralising
4629963 my parents had a hosiery store in the bronx they wanted me to go to law school or anywhere that my degree would end in a job interview and there was i hamlet ing around saying i dont know what to do finally my father said go to your goddamn writing programme if it doesnt work out you can go to law school
4629964 when i published the wanderers the only other 24 year old to publish a novel was martin amis with the rachel papers the median age for a first time novelist in america was about 40 which made far more sense at least they had a life to write about
4629965 had moved on and my bronx existed only in as much as i could remember it i had this real urge to crystallise it and keep it from evaporating
4629966 a loose knit bronx myth cycle that reads like a bunch of twice told tales honed and crafted to wow upstaters
4629967 i wanted to capture the tone of a group of friends getting together 15 years after the event having a drink and saying remember when everything was a little more linear than it actually was a little more exaggerated and a little more heroic
4629968 respects his art and his subject and illuminates our daily world with insights that allow us at times force us to feel closer to other human beings whether we like and approve of them or not
4629969 it was the first time id read a book with concrete in it id read and enjoyed dickens and steinbeck shakespeare jane austen and the rest of the public school canon but i couldnt place myself in any of it my childhood was a lot less dire than selbys world of pill heads and junkies and transvestites and working class guys going on strike but i heard every voice in the book as if they were standing next to me i actually called him up to say thank you and he picked up the phone and spoke in this high pitched nasal brooklyn voice which came as a shock to me i dont know why i thought he might speak like sir john gielgud
4629970 written about my life up to last night and id become bored with myself
4629971 its like being the mechanical draughtsman rather than the architect of a building
4629972 the good thing about that period was that i continued to write i made money and it forced me out of autobiography i learned that i could go to other places and youre not required by law to write about the place you grew up in or what creeps your parents were or how great your parents were
4629973 something like clockers doesnt go above ground level it was all about front line troops junkies and cops these wire guys took it right up to city hall and corrupt congressmen that hadnt been what i did
4629974 if you want to send a message go to western union
4629975 and now many people in new york seem to be nostalgic for places that looked like shit holes do i want lines of heroin addicts queuing round the block no but i did want to deal with the fact that real estate is violence you have a neighbourhood that has been a certain way and then somebody makes a cappuccino the realtors smell that and it becomes a gold mine a lot of people are uprooted and for every person who gets in the papers for committing a crime there are 25 people who never did anything wrong in their lives the thing i really relate to is the changing character of the place the lower east side is now nearly like everywhere else i know this could sound very liberal and sentimental but it really isnt about poor people good rich people bad its just that a bit of history has been lost
4629976 restless they finally pull out to honeycomb the narrow streets for an hour of endless tight right turns falafel joint jazz joint gyro joint corner schoolyard cr perie realtor corner tenement tenement tenement museum corner pink pony blind tiger muffin boutique corner sex shop tea shop synagogue corner boulangerie bar hat boutique corner iglesia gelateria matzo shop corner bollywood buddha botanica corner leather outlet leather outlet leather outlet corner bar school bar school peoples park corner tyson mural celia cruz mural lady di mural corner bling shop barbershop car service corner and then finally on a sooty stretch of eldridge something with potential a weary faced fujianese in a thin members only windbreaker cigarette hanging plastic bags dangling from crooked fingers like full waterbuckets trudging up the dark narrow street followed by a limping black kid half a block behind
4629977 the creation and development of artistic spirit in the members and the dissemination of artistic sentiment generally in the community thus elevating the tone of society
4629978 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4629979 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4629980 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4629981 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4629982 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4629983 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4629984 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4629985 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4629986 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4629987 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4629988 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4629989 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4629990 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4629991 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4629992 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4629993 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4629994 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4629995 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4629996 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4629997 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4629998 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4629999 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
