2430015 were going to be there because its important for people to understand that there is a tragic human consequence to the criminal conduct of gary trebert
2430016 most pastors are not educated on the issues of hiv
2430017 the church has a responsibility to educate and get our people out of the pews and involved in social issues
2430018 theres responsibility but without resources that means i cant do what youre asking me to do
2430019 historically the church has been the voice in the black community the church has a role now but what is that role the church has a great burden

2430032 over the next two years the company will be putting in 2 billion for setting up nationwide gsm network we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2430033 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators

2430042 como la pista es nueva para todos los equipos estamos en la misma posici n respecto al conocimiento del trazado va a ser un reto encontrar la ptima puesta a punto del coche cuando uno tiene una recta tan larga y luego el resto del circuito es mucho m s lento para ser honesto habr que esperar hasta los tests del viernes
2430043 ferrari fue fuerte en spa nosotros en monza todos en el equipo est n esforz ndose para ser fuertes en fuji shanghai e interlagos podemos seguir ganando carreras y haremos todo lo posible para que ocurra en jap n
2430044 no estoy en condiciones de hacer predicciones pero estoy seguro de que el campeonato seguir siendo cosa de cuatro pilotos

2430047 un gran banco espa ol el santander patrocina al equipo y podr a sentirse intranquilo si el piloto espa ol es despedido o sancionado
2430048 en los ltimos cuatro a os he estado viendo la f rmula uno y fernando siempre se queja de que otra gente sea antideportiva pero l trat de echarme de la pista deliberadamente para alguien que admira a otra persona no es un buen ejemplo
2430049 la prensa brit nica no digiere bien la p rdida de puntos de lewis hamilton
2430050 cuando tienes una relaci n con la gente que te rodea haces el trabajo lo mejor que puedes y deseas demostrar a cada uno de ellos que eres uno mas del equipo
2430051 yo era un novato y l un doble campe n del mundo que ven a al equipo pero creo que yo me he ganado m s el respeto de todos con lo que ha ocurrido en las ltimas semanas ellos saben qui n est con el equipo y qui n esta en contra siento que mi relaci n con el equipo es incluso m s fuerte
2430052 quiero ganar de forma limpia no tener que acudir al equipo para que me ayuden quiero ganarle de forma limpia la mejor sensaci n es siempre cuando sabes que has ganado y has batido a alguien tan talentoso como l dentro del mismo equipo con el mismo material y las mismas oportunidades
2430053 no es la persona que cre a que era pero las cosas son as
2430054 falsa modestia de hamilton y est pidas declaraciones sobre alonso
2430055 preacuerdo de fernando alonso con ferrari seg n un diario brit nico
2430056 conduzco para mantener el coche en la pista y ser limpio con todo el mundo pero si las cosas van a ser tan agresivas como l alonso quiere puedo ser tan agresivo como cualquiera ahora ser m s cuidadoso cuando l est cerca
2430057 debemos ser cuidadosos y recordar que somos compa eros de equipo hablar con l este fin de semana porque no hemos hablado desde la ltima carrera y yo tengo mis sentimientos sobre lo que pas entonces
2430058 no voy a salirme o sacar a alguien de la pista por tomar riesgos yo estoy delante de ellos y sa es la cuesti n
2430059 siento que no tengo nada que perder l es el vigente campe n por eso tiene m s presi n encima aunque en las dos ltimas carreras lo ha hecho muy bien parece estar bastante contento en el equipo de repente o al menos consigo mismo
2430060 es importante mantener la calma estar relajado y recordar que este es mi primer a o en la f rmula 1 todav a tengo 22 a os es una experiencia extra a pero la posibilidad de ganar el mundial es real y eso es extraordinario

2430070 the golf course is so nasty right now just nasty
2430071 its very difficult and this is a major its not supposed to be easy
2430072 ive got to play this thing two more times and i dont really want to go into whether or not its fair or what have you everybodys got to play this course
2430073 i think that the raking of the grass away from the grain has made it very difficult
2430074 and given the fact that the greens are firm and fast and you cant control your spin on the ball it is difficult to get it up and down
2430075 i think everyones coming in having stories and ive got my own story
2430076 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2430077 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2430078 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and you can do whatever you want and nothing could be further from the truth
2430079 yeah i didnt think anyone would ever know about it
2430080 i took him for his word as every staffer would
2430081 i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2430082 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2430083 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2430084 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2430085 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2430086 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2430087 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2430088 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades
2430089 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2430090 even the pitches that missed were right on the edges they were competitive pitches
2430091 hes not as sharp as he could be but thats probably because hes a little rusty
2430092 i thought it was coming out of his hand fine
2430093 i feel that hes holding the city hostage and needs to step aside

2430111 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 00 p m and 11 39 pm on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium

2430113 we are now seeing a lot more negative surprises coming out of europe than from the u s more so than any time during this credit shock
2430114 at the same time youve got some pretty strong capital inflows to the u s we kind of have the perfect circle of fundamentals bumping into strong technicals
2430115 this is the beginning of a new chapter for the dollar as trichet and other central banks are paying more attention to the downside risk to growth
2430116 the decline of oil prices is a significant driver behind this dollar rally because it enables other central banks to turn their eyes away from inflation and focus on growth
2430117 the bureau of land management land has some of the best solar resources in the world this could completely stunt the growth of the industry
2430118 you find an oil field and its not long before it starts to decline and then deplete then the oil fields gone the wind doesnt stop

2430124 there are few good foreign policy options because oil really is our economic jugular

2430126 i have to say exactly where i will be for every hour for the next three months
2430127 and that was at a leaving party before i came out here
2430128 sure i might be chesty the day after but the heat and in particular the humidity will hurt me far more trust me there will be a whole lot of dnfs did not finish in every endurance sport walkers cyclists marathon runners triathletes they will all struggle

2430180 memang ada undang undang uu yang melarang bumn memberi sumbangan ke parpol tetapi ada beberapa pola yang dapat dimanfaatkan parpol untuk mengeruk dana dari perusahaan pemerintah itu
2430181 ada beberapa pola untuk mengeruk dana dari bumn seperti penjualan aset dan privatisasi bumn yang dilakukan aktor dari parpol yang duduk di birokrat ini merupakan pola untuk mengeruk dana besar dari bumn
2430182 sudah bukan rahasia lagi jika tim sukses dari elit pemerintahan kemudian diberi hadiah berupa kedudukan atau kursi direksi di bumn dari sini maka dana juga akan mengalir karena ada semacam upeti untuk parpol
2430183 pola ini dilakukan dengan membuat harga saham bumn anjlok setelah itu saham diborong kemudian harga dinaikkan tinggi dan kembali dijual ke pasaran sehingga ada selisih dari penjualan saham ini
2430184 bumn kan perusahaan negara tetapi pada kenyataannya justru tidak memberikan masukan untuk negara lebih banyak ke parpol

2430187 sebenarnya menurut skenario kamu ini orang jenius seperti pak habibie merdeka
2430188 pada dasarnya kamu adalah manusia hebat kamu bisa menjadi pemimpin bangsa ini di masa depan di dalam tubuhmu mengalir darah kesatria yang berwarna putih tetapi sayang pada prakteknya kamu tidak jadi apa apa karena sajenmu kurang
2430189 kamu tahu segala sesuatu itu memerlukan sajen otak saja tidak cukup kepintaran saja tidak menjamin bahkan kelihaian juga bukan kartu kunci untuk membuat kamu sukses kamu memerlukan keikhlasan kamu harus ikhlas ikhlas berarti kamu tulus tulus berarti kamu harus rela rela untuk berkorban kamu harus mengorbankan apa yang dlperlukan kamu tidak akan bisa sukses kalau kamu tidak berani berkorban dengan ikhlas merdeka
2430190 berkorban berkorban apa ini sudah zaman merdeka kita tidak memerlukan pengorbanan jiwa lagi seperti di masa revolusi sepert bapakku kita memerlukan pekerja pekerja lapangan yang canggih dan aku canggih aku tidak mau mengorbankan jiwaku aku mau berbakti kepada bangsa negara dan rakyatku kamu jangan macam macam duk
2430191 tenang merdeka pengorbanan ini bukan pengorbanan fisik ini adalah pengorbanan spiritual dengan berkorban tidak berarti kamu akan kehilangan apa apa kamu hanya harus mengikhlaskan dirimu kehilangan namamu tukar namamu sekarang ganti nama kamu angan lagi merdeka nama itu terlalu besar terlalu berat untuk kamu pikul sendirian tidak mungkin kalau kamu memikulnya kamu akan terlalu repot sehingga kamu tidak akan bisa berbuat apa apa jadi lepaskan saja ganti dengan yang lain oper merdeka itu dengan sesuatu yang lebih ringan apa artinya nama ya tidak
2430192 nama ini pemberian bapakku dia seorang pejuang yang hebat dia orang yang jujur dia sudah berjasa kepada negeri ini tetapi dia tidak punya uang dia tidak punya pabrik dia tidak punya kekuasaan dia hanya punya cita cita dan konsep dan semua itu dia wariskan kepadaku aku tidak bisa mengganti apa yang diwariskan oleh orang tuaku begitu saja karena itu adalah amanat aku tidak mau menjadi manusia durhaka

2430196 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2430197 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2430198 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2430199 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2430200 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2430201 the advertising model has made internet content and services available to millions of people in the united states and around the world for free
2430202 customized advertising gives users a better experience and helps them save time and money
2430203 the opportunity to support content that otherwise would not be supported with mass media economics
2430204 the growing trend of companies tailoring internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
2430205 yahoos argument that without digital data collection there would be an absence of free editorial content online is disingenuous and self serving
2430206 will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
2430207 the concepts of an interior enriched with antiques and a lifestyle surrounded by history are no longer attractive to most people today
2430208 people use antiques as emphasis contrast or counterpoint not to surround themselves with an atmosphere of times past but to give a resonance to contemporary furniture
2430209 dealers now see that people will look at 100 000 pieces on their computer a busy person can see hundreds of chandeliers in minutes and know just where to find the one they want
2430210 it makes no sense to continue to spend 20 000 a month on rent when no ones coming
2430211 my mom wanted to give us a painting as a wedding gift
2430212 we tell our friends what you pay for a reproduction were paying for an original
2430213 were seeing 10 times the number of people than we ever did before
2430214 its changed so about 50 are people who are buying for their home
2430215 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2430216 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2430217 im glad i did because the other guys who were trying to kick in the windshield were about to give up because the flames were getting too hot
2430218 i could hear him screaming and i kept yelling for him
2430219 i kept thinking what if he had been a friend or family member but regardless it was a life
2430220 everyone was shaking my hand and calling me a hero
2430221 i just hope someone would do the same thing for me
2430222 i didnt want to jump from one 20 hour technology day to another
2430223 and of course theres the parties the beautiful women the fun parts of it as well
2430224 a lot of folks when they have wealth find things that will be interesting and unique to their lives
2430225 whether youre a starlet or a rock star everybody wants to have their name on a label
2430226 the hump from start up to real company thats where they fall
2430227 the number of fashion parties ive been to has been small compared to the amount of time ive spent sending something back to the factory
2430228 for an industry so focused on the new and the next theyre very backward for things that will make them more efficient
2430229 we want to get that here as quick as possible
2430230 that transformer has been sitting in california for nearly two months now
2430231 the problem is if there is a lightning strike half of tucson will be out of power
2430232 i have never seen anything so ridiculous with government working so hard to make sure business doesnt work at all
2430233 that places greater demand on other transformers and other substations
2430234 we do have to watch the system closely in the summer
2430235 there is nothing we can do this year regarding the opposed improvements to the ski area
2430236 g iving one religious sect a veto over the use of public park land would deprive others of the right to use what is by definition land that belongs to everyone
2430237 again with this decision the federal government misses an opportunity to help us continue with our way of life in order to benefit skiers and developers
2430238 any action the federal government were to take including action on its own land would be subject to the personalized oversight of millions of citizens
2430239 each citizen would hold an individual veto to prohibit the government action solely because it offends his religious beliefs sensibilities or tastes or fails to satisfy his religious desires
2430240 we were somewhat surprised we thought we had made a pretty good argument last winter and we were hopeful we would get a favorable ruling
2430241 it obviously has some national implications for religious sites all over the united states
2430242 if theres anyone that can bring those disparate views together in a way that represents the spirit and sense of the democratic party its janet napolitano
2430243 viewed by some as a tedious task with more downside than upside
2430244 these mean spirited people and all who are affiliated with them
2430245 three years ago i was a homeless vet on the streets of phoenix
2430246 but the system works they gave me my life back
2430247 it does help clean up the air that we breathe
2430248 it also does make it a little easier when you are on the road if youre riding behind a vehicle that isnt emitting as much
2430249 and theyre not going to have to feel any different
2430250 joanna benson 66 retired shes concerned with gas and food prices says we need to do more drilling and agrees with your economic strategy
2430251 if youre going to ask for their vote then the least you can do is go to their front door and introduce yourself
2430252 people are taking their last vacation before the kids go back to school
2430253 i think it makes a lot of sense for democracy for the people of arizona to have their primary in the spring
2430254 basically it really enhances the incumbents and makes it much easier for them to keep their seat
2430255 when you have a september primary the challenger only has five or six weeks to campaign for the fall general election
2430256 being bald i have to plan to keep my head covered and put sunscreen on
2430257 i work till the bill of my baseball cap starts dripping then i drink a bottle of water that is my gauge
2430258 boys and girls in america have such a sad time together sophistication demands that they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk not courting talk real straight talk about souls for life is holy and every moment is precious

2430266 we will converge on the power station by land sea and air
2430267 there are people that are very prepared to break the law in doing this
2430268 this is part of a long history of civil disobedience and there comes a time when the threat of new coal power stations is so great it justifies breaking the law in order to achieve their objectives
2430269 i do hope that even after the start weve had and the finds weve had that we can negotiate with the organisers of climate camp so that the protest is peaceful and lawful and if there is any unlawful activity or criminal activity we will deal with it
2430270 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination

2430273 youve got to learn to live with what you cant rise above
2430274 anytime we have wind speeds greater than 50 or 55 miles per hour it can cause some damage it was a pretty impressive storm thats for sure
2430275 this is a whole lot different from the bay area
2430276 i swerved and missed them and got stuck on the shoulder i didnt want to get out because i didnt want to get shocked
2430277 while i have always been of the belief that a citizen initiative that comes in below the signature requirements provided in law be disqualified i will abide by my legal counsel and prior court precedent that established i am to certify such a measure for the ballot
2430278 i guess 98 percent really means 100 percent according to our legal system
2430279 i want to get the next president and congress to make securing our border and a comprehensive immigration policy the top priority
2430280 its sort of like having the wolf guarding the henhouse
2430281 your face is breaking out so badly get that under control
2430282 at every forward step and movement at every going in and out when we put on our our clothes and shoes when we bathe when we sit at table when we light the lamps on couch on seat in all the ordinary actions of daily life we trace upon the forehead the sign
2430283 this might be an early reference to individuals tracing the sign of the cross on their body
2430284 to refer to the execution structure see mark 15 21 mark 15 32 matthew 27 32 luke 23 26 john 19 17
2430285 he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
2430286 todays universal use of the sign of the cross makes more poignant the striking lack of crosses in early christian remains especially any specific reference to the event on golgotha most scholars now agree that the cross as an artistic reference to the passion event cannot be found prior to the time of constantine
2430287 from its simplicity of form the cross has been used both as a religious symbol and as an ornament from the dawn of mans civilization various objects dating from periods long anterior to the christian era have been found marked with crosses of different designs in almost every part of the old world

2430290 there is no way that really happens and if it does it cant be that much
2430291 in essence islamic banking is manipulative deceitful and fraudulent at several levels any finance student will tell you that interest based banking as we know it today is a component of inflation risk and the opportunity cost of money it is centrally regulated and transparent furthermore by having a more efficient aggregate demand aggregate supply dynamic one can minimize the inflation component but the other 2 components are the basis of a regulated banking system that is a key aspect of economic and technological growth the islamists have their own arguments which probably culminate in why do something with honesty and transparency when religion can be misused to obfuscate the issue and concentrate power in the hands of a few
2430292 it is true there are about five to six million muslims in the u s and almost a million in canada but thats not a big market to raise capital
2430293 you have to convince the client that there is no element of doubt
2430294 if it hasnt picked up this is because the muslim community is not foolish
2430295 its a complete fraud because what you are doing is you are adding interest upfront and building it into your investments and dishonestly calling it interest free
2430296 we expect that there will be a lot more shariah compliant products offered in canada may be not in the immediate short term but certainly in the medium term
2430297 those who benefit from interest shall be raised like those who have been driven to madness by the touch of the devil this is because they say trade is like interest while god has permitted trade and forbidden interest hence those who have received admonition from their lord and desist may have what has already passed their case being entrusted to god but those who revert shall be the inhabitance of the fire and abide therein for ever

2430306 we share a passion with this country for basketball and we feel honoured our first game is against china
2430307 our team will feel that spirit of international sport and the heights a team can reach when it plays for its country starting off the olympics like that is a very important thing for us the chinese people have been amazing to our team in our warm up games and preparation they will treat us with respect

2430312 the arctic may hold 90 billion barrels of oil more than all the known reserves of nigeria kazakhstan and mexico combined and enough to supply u s demand for 12 years

2430315 lost fostered the idea per se of international organizations with increasing transnational jurisdiction its bureaucracy will be nourished by royalties on mineral extraction and provide a model for similar agencies to assume authority and impose taxes and to inexorably devour american institutions and autonomy
2430316 if americans have learned anything about the united nations over the last 50 years it is that this world body is at best riddled with corruption and incompetence
2430317 the region above the arctic circle also holds an estimated 1 669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equal to 27 percent of the worlds known gas reserves according to the u
2430318 contributors to the data included the geological survey of canada the u s interior departments minerals management service the norwegian petroleum directorate the cambridge arctic shelf program and researchers in denmark and greenland no russian institutions took part in the study

2430325 russia completely devastated the port of poti on the black sea which is a key port for the transport of energy sources from the caspian sea and is close to the baku supsa pipeline and the supsa oil terminal
2430326 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time
2430327 they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2430328 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2430329 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2430330 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2430331 i really didnt hit the ball that well starting out
2430332 i made a double on my first hole and made a pretty ridiculous bogey on 12
2430333 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2430334 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2430335 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2430336 i dont think there is one team in the country that can beat us every single time
2430337 if we hit well from 1 to 9 theres no one can beat us
2430338 it was all nba just them talking about strengths and minuses of all these players what they would do if they were the general manager how theyd get rid of this guy before his value went down
2430339 i could hear them being three gms back there what they would do for every team it was funny theyre very knowledgeable
2430340 i was excited about the season even before the new contract
2430341 this has given that extra measure of knowing that im going to be taken care of here im excited about this team
2430342 were talking about a hall of fame caliber player this is a premier guy leader and player
2430343 i mean what hes done the last few weeks with this going on the work he came out there when he had strep throat and practiced when he had an excuse regardless of what was going on
2430344 he just wants to win so badly he wants the team to be the best it can be thats what drives him thats whats always driven him thats the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2430345 it can be great if we continue to stay healthy and continue to progress
2430346 consistency is the main thing we have to focus on having all our guys healthy and being full steam ahead we can do some great things seeing what we were able to do at the end of last year we have to put it together
2430347 i think it was the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2430348 its definitely the longest contract ive ever seen it was 52 pages of just addendums
2430349 it gives you that peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2430350 all of us wanted to get the deal done as quick as we could
2430351 but brian and his agent they hung in there there wasnt a single moment when there was any threat they couldnt have been more positive or professional throughout the whole thing even this afternoon they werent saying lets hurry up or hes not going to play in this game
2430352 i cant speak to why the deal didnt get done before but i know we kept hammering away in order to do something that made sense for the player
2430353 from the first day i was able to represent brian we worked aggressively with the team to try to make something work we tried to get very creative and find a structure that would allow us to get something done while still dealing with the rules that were in place
2430354 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence
2430355 it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2430356 i dont feel sorry about things that didnt happen its reality thats the way it goes
2430357 ive been riding for 30 years and rarely even got seven day suspensions
2430358 the 21 days seems like a lot but considering she broke her leg i understand
2430359 my horse switched leads and came in a little bit i didnt even know there had been a spill until i was coming back after the race and saw the loose horses running around
2430360 shes a good rider and it was just an unlucky situation i went to the hospital to see her and she understood weve been riding together for three years and it certainly wasnt deliberate were all trying hard to win but ive never dropped a rider before i feel terrible for her it still bothers me
2430361 it was wonderful the owners roberta mendenhall and steve bertrando were there steves father who is 89 had a brain operation the week before but came out for the race
2430362 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2430363 i was there along with coach cheeks and tony dileo when the injury occurred which was during a routine five on five drill at an nba approved camp held in las vegas
2430364 there was no contact made with jason when he suffered the injury
2430365 at this point we will continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
2430366 but hes a hard worker hes going to get this taken care of and be back to 100 percent
2430367 i feel like rutgers is a place where i can really improve as a player
2430368 and its a program on the rise one that has a chance at competing for a national title its going to be exciting to be a part of that
2430369 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2430370 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2430371 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2430372 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2430373 we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
2430374 didnt do anything wrong its just that he could have done it differently
2430375 its like it wasnt meant for us to score it was one of those nights
2430376 there are ups and downs that happens through the year in a game like this you just tip your hat to the other pitcher he pitched a great game
2430377 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2430378 the need to demonstrate our sovereignty in the arctic has never been more important which is why our government has made this research a top priority
2430379 our commitment to this initiative as well as other investments in the north is ultimately about turning potential into prosperity for this remarkable region and for our country as a whole
2430380 this joint research is another step supporting canadas submission in relation to the extended polar continental shelf in the high arctic
2430381 there will be a battle between canadian and danish scientists on one side and the russians on the other
2430382 i dont see a period in the history of earth during which these two continental plates were connected
2430383 im not going to throw him right back in there i can tell you that
2430384 i havent had a chance to talk to him since this visit
2430385 theres a game plan when he gets here in terms of what is going to happen purely from a medical perspective
2430386 beyond that im sure andy has a creative plan in terms of the football part of it
2430387 the deal is fairly cap neutral to this particular year
2430388 i think it increased it a bit but nothing that would change anything we were thinking or any flexibility we would want to have it changes the cap numbers obviously over the next three four or five years it is moderately more next year significantly more in year three
2430389 i wouldnt pass the buck to the players i think im under the gun we got to stay on top of things
2430390 maybe i overreacted in the sense that i think they exploited a couple of things
2430391 i think they really didnt try to get both sides
2430392 the reasons why i dismissed both taylor and baker are reasons that the squad knows and i feel comfortable with the right decision
2430393 its the biggest game in the worlds history thats what theyre saying
2430394 do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars
2430395 darylls done very very well and part of that is because hes played in games more than pat has
2430396 and so when he comes into preseason and does really well daryll hasnt left the door open for anyone to jump him but pat really hasnt done anything to fall behind or not be right there with him
2430397 i think ive made it clear that i would prefer to play one quarterback
2430398 but the way the game is played today with the quarterback really physically so much more involved in it i think you got to be careful
2430399 you needed a guy in there who just took over the whole football team
2430400 in my mind im like ok keep doing what youre doing and you will wind up being the starter
2430401 unless were going to do the dual quarterback thing if thats the case thats fine too
2430402 were going to try and put the right guy in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing
2430403 devlin may be the guy i have no way of knowing yet weve had four days of practice
2430404 i was in a bad area for a signal and my phone said call lost
2430405 i hurt my groin about a month and a half ago and just havent pitched much since then when i got activated off the disabled list everyone else was throwing good and there was pretty much no room but i feel good well see how it goes from here
2430406 hes got experience hes very useable and hes been there
2430407 i think hes going to get to pitch quite a bit and hes going to help us when i listened to him talk he feels like hes ready hes healthy and hes ready to go
2430408 im very happy im with a team in first place and i couldnt be more happy with the situation
2430409 well have a better idea of where hes headed with this after that
2430410 lew knows more about his anatomy so i think that its important we get another opinion on how were going to proceed
2430411 right now flash is just trying to gather his information and try to figure out whats best for him we have not talked about surgery no ones even mentioned if hes having surgery i think for him right now its probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and see where hes heading
2430412 obviously im disappointed you never want to go down but ill get some innings in and get back on track and stay on their radar
2430413 happs going to play in the big leagues and more likely hes going to pitch with the phillies
2430414 it was slow to hit me but that moment is finally here with all the phone calls from friends that makes me realize this is something more special its mind boggling to me
2430415 the circumstances of mannys final hours with the red sox
2430416 nothing but ive sold about 40 subscriptions in the last two days and made about 2000 wanna buy a subscription
2430417 its the first bad outing ive had in a long time im not going to look much into it i felt like i made some good pitches yeah i got the leadoff hitter on quite a bit twice in three innings but got out of it in the second inning im not too upset about it even on their singles like what ground balls shrugs so thats not a big deal gave up a couple doubles three but i felt like i made some good pitches and competed which is all that really matters what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles or so im just not real upset about it im just gonna move on ive already done that
2430418 honestly its quite a bit the same i just got ahead of guys i felt like i made good pitches when i tried to get them out i jammed some guys got some bloop hits at the end that second inning which i told you earlier i got that leadoff double and he didnt score ive been working on throwing that cutter inside and it got me out of that jam i dont know i felt like i got ahead of guys fine
2430419 you have to make quality pitches on a consistent basis if you want to pitch deep into games and win ballgames
2430420 but now this is what the lord says fear not for i have redeemed you i have called you by name you are mine
2430421 well come on ive been waiting for you what took you so long
2430422 because you are precious and honored in my sight and because i love you
2430423 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest
2430424 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls
2430425 your name come to me you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest
2430426 film types and film viewing practices that are themselves constantly changing
2430427 the relationship these works establish with their audience and the sorts of responses they typically evoke
2430428 it is a type marked by both its highly specified and limited audience as well as a singular pleasure that this audience finds in the films transgressions
2430429 from the norm and from the conventional self we are supposed to become
2430430 ranging from elements of the film narrative to its exhibition practices to the audiences needs and to a spirit of the times which effectively constructs that audience
2430431 human icons evoke all the more keenly a modern sense of estrangement and alienation that we commonly feel

2430441 constant interruptions of film shockingly disallow any point of rest for the viewer preventing any easy recognition of a familiar world
2430442 young people who were so engrossed in animation comics or video games that they turned their backs on any pretence that relationships with others were important

2430447 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2430448 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2430449 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2430450 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2430451 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2430452 how else am i supposed to convey my sadness to so many people simultaneously
2430453 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2430454 this is basically the biggest licensing programme weve seen for a

2430732 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principles of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
2430733 you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed

2430756 sinds ik studentenpredikant was heeft mij de vraag bezig gehouden waarom zoveel mensen de christelijke geloofstraditie naast zich neerleggen een vraag die mij in de loop der jaren hoe langer hoe meer verontrustte
2430757 de mens is voor een tijd een plaats van god
2430758 wat is de mens dat ge aan hem denkt gij hebt hem bijna goddelijk gemaakt
2430759 dat christus ons in zon conditie vinden moest alsof hij met de vader had gesmoesd
2430760 o heer onze heer hoe heerlijk is uw naam op de ganse aarde
2430761 als ik de hemel aanschouw het werk van uw vingers wat is dan de mens ik
2430762 de mythe is het onder woorden brengen van een ervaring
2430763 niet ets van mij zal voortleven maar ik zelf mijn hele ik zal door god op de dood terugveroverd worden
2430764 ik zal het einde van dit nieuwe jaar niet meemaken
2430765 dat biedt me geen extra troost ik heb er geen behoefte aan
2430766 ik heb geen behoefte aan een leven na dit leven als ik niet zo lang meer zal leven dan is mijn leven zinvol geweest
2430767 afscheid nemen is moeilijk hoe zal het gaan met mijn kinderen
2430768 ik heb geen behoefte aan een hemel het geeft me geen extra troost als ik niet zo lang meer zal leven dan is mijn leven zinvol geweest
2430769 geloof hoop en liefde blijven maar het meest de liefde
2430770 een mens voor een tijd een plaats is van god

2430782 at the 2007 world championships i did seven events my training has gone very well im getting excited its been a very long training camp were excited to get this going
2430783 the one im looking forward to the most is the 100 back
2430784 thats my pet event i feel the targets the largest in that event
2430785 theres a lot of fast freestylers out there im just looking to get on the podium any way i can i have no expectations for the 200 im
2430786 i have a lot of goals going into beijing but im keeping them to myself
2430787 there are other teams just as strong we have to do our best when it matters people get so focused on the americans and the australians they forget other teams are out there
2430788 ils ont t lib r s les chefs coutumiers locaux et les autorit s du puntland ont aid leur lib ration
2430789 the defense is taking you to the ground and hitting you as hard as it can
2430790 i dont have a doubt in my mind but this builds my confidence we still have a lot of camp to go so we cant just throw it out the window but it feels good
2430791 its pretty evident that we need to win the turnover battle so we need everyone to know how to secure footballs how to take footballs away how to recover footballs and how to get tipped balls
2430792 thats what its about anybody and everybody who could possibly come into contact with a football are doing it
2430793 i think darian hagan is playing as well as he has since hes been here
2430794 thats really good to see but he has to keep it going and be consistent
2430795 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2430796 we lost by 28 points in the first game against puerto rico in 2004 and it did more than just get your attention it blew us all away
2430797 it was like a big red light out there flashing
2430798 hes the only gold medalist on our team hes someone our young players look up to and because of his experience and leadership we felt he had a role
2430799 i just try to share my experience of 2000 because we havent had the success weve wanted the last couple of years
2430800 the worlds gotten better at the game of basketball we all understand that so were ready for the challenge
2430801 you can put the best players together but we all understand that we dont need kobe to score 30 we dont need lebron to score 30 we just need to be a team and play for that extra pass and when you look at the point guard situation in chris and deron we have that leadership that we didnt have in 04
2430802 but im very excited about being near the lead i want to see how i handle it
2430803 the greens are dead theyre seriously dying its not a complaint but theyre on the edge of bye bye
2430804 hes definitely earned that role everything hes done has been remarkable to this point
2430805 obviously im not sure my role in this game long term is as a closer but if i can help the team get a win and save the bullpen ill do whatever i can to help i know its hustons job long term no doubt about it
2430806 for a couple of weeks i just tried to pitch through it and kept my mouth shut
2430807 i was going 100 percent and all of a sudden i stopped thats a lot of torque
2430808 i felt a little something not like a pop or a strain but like a muscle rolled over
2430809 hes our quarterback so hes our leader but we have a great group of guys around him that will make it easy
2430810 he was a little bit nervous right away he looked comfortable once he got those first snaps out of the way
2430811 i thought his feet looked exceptional very pleased with michael
2430812 its good to see no matter who you plug in there we can move the ball
2430813 i was excited to see those guys get out there in a game situation i knew theyd respond i knew theyd perform
2430814 he missed a couple of passes that we would have liked to get
2430815 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2430816 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2430817 the usga was proud to call orville moody an open and senior open champion
2430818 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2430819 i thought some calls were missed tonight which was unfortunate
2430820 these guys the umps are good but there were a handful of changeups i thought were in the zone that changes the at bats that part is frustrating but ive got to make better pitches with my changeup
2430821 the rest of the inning was all right i had decent stuff a couple of strange things happened but that was it
2430822 because hes thrown some fine ballgames big innings have hurt him this season
2430823 since the first couple of outings i dont look at who is at bat
2430824 when they come up i try to zone that out so i dont get star struck or pitch around them its been working a little bit so ill just keep on throwing my stuff
2430825 its because they are so into teamwork and they looked at him as the guy who set things up

2430830 i think it would have complicated what were trying to do
2430831 i think we would have been accused and rightfully so of not getting off our addiction to the strategy that worked for so many years but then didnt work and that we were slow to recognize didnt work
2430832 we would have continued our addiction to it without bonds that i think would have been a mistake we probably wouldnt have aaron rowand if that had happened we still had randy winn freddie lewis wouldnt be starting wed have a great hitter to me mannys been the best hitter in the american league the last 15 years or so he still would have been on a club in my opinion that wasnt going to win 90 games
2430833 im sure he feels he didnt leave under circumstances that he felt he deserved
2430834 i understand that he would say with all i did for this franchise i should be allowed to go out on my own terms yes we felt we had to go in a different direction i tried to tell him why we had to do that i think he understood the logic of it but i think he just didnt want to hear that
2430835 what would i do if i were world famous and a millionaire
2430836 weve been battling every night trying to win ballgames and hopefully we can keep playing that way there are a lot more games left
2430837 that was a shot in the arm for us as a club and me personally
2430838 it was against the same lineup virtually and a totally different outcome this time i started to get a little gassed near the end but the momentum of us swinging the bat and holding the lead replaced that i rode the adrenaline really
2430839 he was so sick in boston he looked very skinny very bad but he battled and did what he needed to do
2430840 i was trying not to do too much thinking about right field and not pulling the ball because rogers throws a lot of offspeed stuff
2430841 i knew i was getting a good pitch to hit
2430842 obviously as you grow older you tend to calm down a little bit
2430843 with all due respect id like to see him play this course the way it is even he would be struggling
2430844 the ryder cup is over for me thats how i look at it
2430845 my whole intent this year was to make the team i didnt make the team so im embarrassed and disappointed the golf course didnt do anything to me im the one who played like an idiot who played like a 20 handicap
2430846 he was just being woody do i need to call shannon austins wife and tell her to remove all the sharp objects for a day or two and let him know hes got three tournaments to go
2430847 a lot of people thought he was over the hill at that time
2430848 but he still brought more to the ballpark than most human beings ever thought of
2430849 he had instincts and insights into the game that far outstripped anybody we had on that team he still had the best first step quickness ive ever seen in terms of taking an extra base for a young guy like me it was a privilege to call him a teammate
2430850 the fastest player ive seen since allen iverson was a rookie
2430851 i thought the offense moved the ball well but we shot ourselves in the foot a few times
2430852 if it had been 4th and 1 we were planning on going for it
2430853 it wasnt my call but we wanted to get the field goal on the board it was nice to finally get some tempo going
2430854 obviously theres going to be a lot to learn from
2430855 i just underthrew him i tried to throw it on the run
2430856 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games

2430859 with him in our heart its gods mission to reach out to every lost soul and to bring them to himself thats where we get to participate the holy spirit lives in each one of us that have accepted jesus and we

2430870 this is an important area for commercial harvest of eels and catfish
2430871 we have a lot of people in these watersheds and very little forest cover left
2430872 so our waters have more nutrients than they should and theyre warmer than they should be so these things combine to allow algae to thrive
2430873 we were so excited about the grasses and then this happened and we were like oh no
2430874 if we had this on the eastern shore we might get one phone call
2430875 but we have it in baltimore county and the phone is off the hook

2430880 this is a public health approach that looks at violence as a behavior that needs to be changed
2430881 people are hearing from people they look up to in their community that they dont have to pull out a gun to settle a dispute
2430882 we want to be a messenger to stop violence stop homicides stop the shootings
2430883 our people get them to pause and think our people get them to reflect because of the respect they have
2430884 i told the victim he would still have to come to court and he would have to tell the truth

2430889 the fire department told me when they came that if the alarm hadnt worked wed be dead

2430894 over the years we think a lot of those people were scared to talk or have made assumptions that we have information that we dont
2430895 with a cold case the most important thing to remember is that relationships change people mature and guilt takes over they may have information that theyre now willing to share
2430896 we have new samples to test and we are testing some right now as we speak
2430897 no one in the class is a suspect but other people that we all knew were at the party its as if this code of silence went out as if to protect someone
2430898 that was the last person who wasnt involved in her death who saw her
2430899 most of the people that weve looked at were several years older than donna but lived in the bowie area
2430900 donna and her friends hung out with a high school crowd but also an older crowd who were involved in the drug world they were not the best group but there are other persons outside of that group that weve looked at
2430901 we think there are multiple crime scenes and were certain theres more than one person involved
2430902 had the opportunity and the motive to commit the murder of donna dustin
2430903 to the best of my understanding he was cooperative both in 1973 and again when the investigation was picked up by their cold case squad
2430904 the focus hasnt narrowed in any further on the florida and new york men yet this case is still active and wide open

2430946 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport

2430948 saya sekarang lebih banyak tinggal di amerika tapi masih sering mengunjungi indonesia
2430949 persaingan mendapatkan posisi sebagai profesor di amerika memang sangat ketat setiap satu lowongan lebih dari 350 orang yang mendaftar
2430950 ayah saya seorang pekerja keras saya juga terbiasa melakukannya sejak muda hingga menjadi profesor seperti sekarang
2430951 bimbingan keluarga orang tua guru dan sekolah itu penting tapi yang lebih penting adalah usaha kita
2430952 yang terpenting lakukan hal yang paling kamu sukai sehingga kamu pasti berhasil di dalamnya tentu saja ditambah dengan usaha yang keras
2430953 saya tidak punya rencana sejauh itu toh 20 tahun lagi kita adalah citizen of the world orang akan bebas tinggal di mana pun
2430954 semua kenangan tetang masa kecil dan orang tua saya ada di sini saya tentu tidak bisa melupakan indonesia
2430955 untuk mendapatkan gelar tersebut kan susah butuh banyak biaya untuk riset dan penelitian
2430956 di amerika banyak yang mau memberikan bantuan dana untuk pendidikan dan saya bisa mencarikannya dengan mudah
2430957 sejak kecil saya ingin jadi pendidik di bidang sains dan engineering sayangnya posisi ini di indonesia kurang dihargai
2430958 inilah yang menjadikan mutu pendidikan kita rendah guru guru dengan gaji dan fasilitas pas pasan tentunya tidak bisa memberikan pelayanan optimal karena harus mencari tambahan sampingan
2430959 jika ada profesor yang kembali ke indonesia ditawari jadi dosen atau anggota dewan maka jawabannya pasti yang terakhir its the reality
2430960 jika ada satu saja universitas di indonesia yang setara dengan di as maka anak anak kita yang pandai tidak akan lari ke luar negeri mereka akan memilih kuliah di negaranya sendiri

2430964 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2430965 the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2430966 now that there is talk that georgia and ukraine might join nato at some point i think russia which has significantly reasserted itself on the world stage has said point blank that this will not happen
2430967 russias voice has been ignored many times by the west on nato expansion on kosovo on iraq and i think this time russia is determined because this is on the russian border and russia assumes that this is a territory where russia has very serious interests
2430968 people are there without water food electricity they cant leave their shelters
2430969 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2430970 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2430971 while many states of the country have not completed even the first phase of its implementation madhya pradesh has already started distribution of right papers so far we have received 2 35 lakh claims from the people for this purpose
2430972 over the next two years the company will be putting in usd 2 billion for setting up nationwide gsm network we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2430973 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators

2431010 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2431011 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2431012 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2431013 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2431014 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2431015 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2431016 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2431017 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2431018 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2431019 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2431020 i have no reason to be believe that the public is in any danger
2431021 its just so far outside the realm of what i consider possible
2431022 its not going to kill you but itll ruin your weekend
2431023 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2431024 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2431025 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2431026 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction
2431027 as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2431028 i wanted to keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2431029 i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2431030 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2431031 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2431032 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2431033 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens
2431034 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2431035 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family and thats all i have to say
2431036 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2431037 we are now checking if he could be the german citizen christian karl gerhartsreiter
2431038 he has no memory of being from germany or of having a german brother
2431039 he tells me hes clark rockefeller i believe him i havent been shown any hard evidence that hes something other than what he tells me he is
2431040 he tells me he still doesnt remember about the past
2431041 he doesnt remember murdering anybody there and he doesnt remember being a tenant of the couple that was murdered
2431042 in every place there are troublemakers some stay like that and others change
2431043 i like it here but for teenagers its a little boring
2431044 id like to live in berlin or any big city in germany
2431045 he said he was hosting a radio show doing classical music
2431046 but the way i know simon i could never really imagine that its so shocking because simon was such a nice person
2431047 just because someone uses aliases doesnt mean they are guilty of anything
2431048 if this happens its a tremendous help in the casino debate
2431049 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia
2431050 this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2431051 the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2431052 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to deescalate the tension and avoid conflict
2431053 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2431054 calls into question the viability of georgia as a state their viability as a responsible member of the world community
2431055 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2431056 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2431057 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2431058 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2431059 i am an artiste but they had no respect for me the office watchmen insulted me i wanted to meet ekta kapoor to get some work
2431060 we have registered an attempt to suicide case and will inform his family members in allahabad
2431061 im very confident that we are were going to get 200 000 plants out of here
2431062 thats what leads me to believe that this is an organization rather than people operating independently
2431063 were going to make a significant dent in all the major grows
2431064 the ones tending the grows are only getting paid piecework the one at the top of the food chain is the guy im after
2431065 i think they are trying to cut their losses harvest what they can and get rid of them
2431066 weve been run ragged the past two weeks but we are disrupting a major organization thats the reward
2431067 in fact there are people on the streets that are saying that marijuana is getting hard to come by

2431071 it was an accident it was an accident all the time
2431072 my son never would have done it on purpose we loved becca like a daughter but we know michael never would have done something like that on purpose
2431073 i dont understand why they came to that conclusion i cant even grasp it
2431074 rebecca would have wanted the jury to know how she really wore her shirt that night
2431075 we see it as vindication we feel horrible that the tatums lost a daughter and that a young woman lost her life but were grateful that spencers reputation was vindicated
2431076 they really want to retain their employees and put them through the growing process and into management positions thats one thing the bank has been really good at
2431077 its been great its a real nice place when were not working ashley and i will go to the gym and he and his girlfriend do all the housework so i dont have to do anything
2431078 ive found it challenging but in a good way ive loved doing different things like crying one day and then shouting the next
2431079 id like to stay in the show for as long as they want to keep me
2431080 but eventually i might want a change im just trying to learn as much as i can and ill see where the future takes me
2431081 a lot of people have been told they will no longer be working on river city and there are fears more will go we are talking about people who have worked long hours for years who are suddenly being sacked without so much as a thankyou its a kick in the teeth no one was prepared for this
2431082 i have been there since the beginning and they basically took me in and said we think you should go get other jobs a lot of the main people on the show have been lost
2431083 neither our wardrobe nor make up departments have been recruited as yet
2431084 when we resume filming there will be a mixture of individuals who have worked on river city before as well as some who havent
2431085 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
2431086 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2431087 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
2431088 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
2431089 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
2431090 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
2431091 there were plenty of shockwaves when news started to break of the departures some of the cast were shocked to say the least but grew to accept their fate it shows that the new boss wants to take the show forward and isnt afraid of ruffling feathers along the way
2431092 we thought we had an opportunity to partner with the chinese american community in chinatown to do something rather special
2431093 philadelphia has so many unique assets to promote and demonstrate to the world that we are a great international city
2431094 this is a 100 year dream coming true for the chinese people and china is a peace loving country
2431095 the beijing olympics is now allowing the world to see the chinese culture and tradition
2431096 i think the chinese have done a phenomenal job with the olympic games
2431097 theyve welcomed the world theyve welcomed the athletes and its going to be a top olympic games
2431098 it makes me feel a little bit younger until i see myself in the mirror
2431099 its like a dream come true because most of us dont have the opportunity to go to beijing
2431100 were the place where you send homeless vets when you dont know what to do with them
2431101 we try to meet their immediate needs get em stabilized and go from there
2431102 we typically bring in between 60 000 to 75 000 with the festival
2431103 even then we normally have a 500 000 budget shortfall for the programs we run
2431104 part of the mission for the festival is also educating military veterans and their families about the benefits theyre entitled to
2431105 some of them fall between the cracks when they get discharged but we make sure they get counseling
2431106 it was our position he strickland be given a sentence that guaranteed these women and the rest of the women in the city that he would not get out
2431107 il nen est pas question ce nest pas notre probl me dailleurs ce nest plus un probl me m dical puisquelle est en train de mourir et que les traitements sont devenus inutiles
2431108 ce nest pas mon probl me estimez vous heureux que nous nayons pas annul son assurance apr s son diagnostic
2431109 this sentence serves as a clear message that if you deprive the public of your honest services and abuse your position of trust you will go to prison
2431110 concentration of world evil full of hatred for humanity it is fully determined to destroy your society must you wait until it comes to smash through your borders until the young men of america have to fall defending the borders of their continent
2431111 kurdistans president massoud barzani headed a meeting of the general command of the regions border guarding forces to discuss the issue of unifying the two ministries of peshmerga and peshmerga affairs into one ministry
2431112 these challenges lead to a conclusion that casinos of this program type do not work on these sites and by extension would be better sited elsewhere
2431113 im not surprised that this is where they ended up
2431114 you just never know whos going to get arrested in these situations
2431115 we locked up some women for prostitution immediately thereafter and have continued to focus in
2431116 you have to consider how prostitution impacts the quality of life in the area some acts are done in plain view of residents and children
2431117 we did allow him to notify his supervisors to make arrangements to pick up his truck
2431118 i hate to say it but well probably be out there doing this again and again
2431119 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
2431120 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
2431121 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come

2431123 such was marcus whitman the missionary hero to plead that the state should acquire the empire that the churches were gaining for christianity never in the history of the world has there been a finer example of civilization following christianity the missionaries led under the banner of the cross and the settlers moved close behind under the star spangled symbol of the nation
2431124 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2431125 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2431126 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2431127 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2431128 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2431129 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2431130 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2431131 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2431132 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2431133 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2431134 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2431135 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2431136 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2431137 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb

2431142 he got a lot of criticism after what happened at birmingham last season but until then everybody said he was a fantastic captain

2431146 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children who have been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma
2431147 antibiotics are given to treat the respiratory condition and rather than being a cause of asthma as has been previously suggested they are used for chest infections which can indicate an increased risk of asthma or be mistaken for it
2431148 our data still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics may affect the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months

2431240 these activists have delivered a message of solidarity with the tibetan people highlighting the grave situation in tibet just moments before the beijing olympics began
2431241 the chinese government wants the world to be dazzled and distracted by the grandeur of the opening ceremony but its true face can be seen in its ruthless and intensifying repression of the tibetan people

2431291 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2431292 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2431293 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2431294 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2431295 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2431296 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2431297 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2431298 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2431302 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2431303 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2431304 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2431305 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2431306 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal

2431394 it seems to be a very common offence now that lot of vulnerable young children are having their mobile phones stolen from them both when being asked for the time and when walking along using them

2431396 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2431397 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2431398 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2431399 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2431409 the news media selectively picking and choosing who to vilify has been on a bonds hunt for two seasons now it may be confronted with clemens if i know my industry there will now be calls for restraint for withholding judgments there will be calls for evenhandedness for letting it play itself out following the truth where it leads right

2431423 influenta clerului intr un ev al superstitiei poate fi folosita in mod pozitiv pentru afirmarea drepturilor omenirii insa atat de intima a fost legatura intre tron si altar ca steagul bisericii a fost extrem de rar vazut de partea poporului
2431424 in mainile stangace ale lui iustin si ale apologetilor care i au urmat intelesul sublim al oracolelor iudaice se evapora in tipuri indepartate ingamfari afectate si alegorii reci chiar autenticitatea lor devenea suspecta unui ne iudeu politeist gentile neluminat prin amestecul de contra faceri pioase care sub numele de orfeu hermes cibela ii erau impuse ca de egala valoare cu niste inspiratii veritabile ale divinitatii

2431474 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2431475 i agree with the majority that macasaet failed to substantiate his story however i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that this suffices to hold macasaet guilty of contempt of court
2431476 i respectfully reiterate my dissent in the in re emil jurado case i vote to dismiss the contempt charge
2431477 macasaet was reduced to a passive participant unable to subject the testimonies of adverse witnesses to rigorous probing under cross examination as matters stand macasaet will be subjected to punitive sanctions based on evidence he had no opportunity to scrutinize
2431478 before a journalist can be punished in a criminal contempt case as in this case there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt that his publication tends to obstruct administration of justice and the degree of imminence of the obstruction actually happening extremely high
2431479 fails to meet the applicable standard in contempt by publication proceedings
2431480 we must scrutinize macasaets publications through the lens of the clear and present danger test guided by these queries 1 is the evil consequence of macasaets publications extremely serious and 2 is the degree of its imminence extremely high the facts of this case do not meet either criterion
2431481 falsity and negligence test asks the questions 1 whether macasaets story was false and 2 whether macasaet could have prevented the publication of the false story by exercising diligence in verifying its veracity
2431482 failure to substantiate a story or even the mere falsity of publications had long ceased to suffice to hold journalists in contempt of court unless there is a clear and present danger that such false reports will impair the administration of justice
2431483 under the falsity and negligence test any kind of unflattering publication to a judge or court whether or not putting at risk a fair trial or decision become punishable for contempt if false and the journalist could have prevented the publication by exercising diligence to verify its veracity good faith is not a defense
2431484 is a sharp dagger aimed at the heart of free speech and of free press the falsity and negligence test compels the journalist to guarantee the veracity of what he writes on pain of criminal contempt of court obviously this has a chilling effect on free speech and free press
2431485 the undue weight give to the falsity alone of respondents columns in unsettling for after finding respondents columns as false the majority did not go any further to determine whether these falsehoods constitute a clear and present danger to the administration of justice
2431486 macasaet and newsbreak based their reports on the alleged bribery from information obtained from their respective confidential sources in short it was professional call on the part of macasaet and newsbreak to run the story this court should be the last to attribute negative motives for this judgment call
2431487 as the highest court of the land the court should be the first to resist the temptation to privilege its members with the shield of lese majeste through the liberal falsity and negligence test this court diminishes itself if it diminishes the free press guarantee for an independent judiciary needs a free press as much as a free press needs an independent judiciary
2431488 many types of criticisms leveled at the judiciary cross the line to become harmful and irresponsible attacks these potentially devastating attacks and unjust criticism can threaten the independence of the judiciary
2431489 first the criticism will prevent judges from remaining insulated from the personal and political consequences of making an unpopular decision thus placing judicial independence at risk second unjust criticism of the judiciary will erode the publics trust and confidence in the judiciary as an institution
2431490 a free press is not to be preferred to an independent judiciary nor an independent judiciary to a free press neither has primacy over the other both are indispensable to a free society
2431491 disproportionately informing the public about specific court processes or by spreading unsubstantiated allegations about corruption and other forms of judicial misconduct the press dramatically undermines the publics faith in the courts and threatens the very foundation of our democratic government
2431492 people may lose faith in the executive or the president they may lose faith in congress the congressmen and the senators but as long as they have faith unshaken and complete in the last bulwark of democracy which is the supreme court then our democracy will survive
2431493 we have no problems with legitimate criticisms pointing out flaws in our decisions
2431494 unfortunately the published articles of respondent macasaet are not of this genre on the contrary he has crossed the line as his are baseless scurrilous attacks which demonstrate nothing but abuse of press freedom
2431495 illegitimate and uninformed criticisms against the courts and judges those which cross the line and attempt to subvert the judicial process must be avoided
2431496 freedom however has not guaranteed quality journalism the press has been vulnerable to a host of legitimate criticisms such as incompetence commercialism and even corruption
2431497 reeked of urban legend as it generated more questions than answers
2431498 his aim as he admits was to go on a fishing expedition to see if someone would confirm or deny his now clearly baseless accusations
2431499 it is precisely because of his failure to abide by the tenets of responsible journalism that we accept the findings of the investigating committee in holding respondent macasaet guilty of indirect contempt of court
2431500 not absolute for if left unbridled they have the tendency to be abused and can translate to licenses which could lead to disorder and anarchy
2431501 the committee finds that neither macasaets columns in malaya nor ms vitugs story in newsbreak about the pay off of php 10 million to justice consuelo ynares santiago for rendering a resolution favorable to henry go in his petition against the sandiganbayan according to macasaet or a decision favoring barque against manotok in a big land case according to ms vitug have a leg to stand on
2431502 the committee observed that macasaets story about the bribery and of cecilias role in supposedly discovering it is full of holes inconsistencies and contradictions indicating that he did not exercise due diligence patience and care in checking the veracity of the information fed to him before giving it publicity in his columns nor was he bothered by the damage that his columns would inflict on the reputation of a member of the highest court and on the court itself

2431505 people are on vacation and want to check in with their home church or theyre sick but still want the service
2431506 not everyone is in favor of the online worship sites
2431507 my initial thoughts are that part of worship is community and its hard to have community when youre not face to face with people
2431508 even with our youth they come to church because theres a part of worship they like and part of that is being with people
2431509 i think the web and sitting in front of your computer is a poor substitute for being face to face with people

2431550 we have received reports from our defense ministry that five russian military aircraft have taken off from russias north caucasus region heading for tbilisi
2431551 thats why the decision has been made to immediately evacuate the presidents administration and a number of other important government agencies

2431559 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2431560 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2431561 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2431562 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2431563 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2431564 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum
2431565 if they do it again we will take a stern action
2431566 i have negotiated with the dang wangi police to stop the forum at 9 30am or else we will act
2431567 some protesters just dont understand it not everyone who attended the forum is against islam
2431568 some just participated to voice out their views in defending the position of islam in the country
2431569 this forum is about islam they want indians to be muslims and then muslims to be indians
2431570 they have organised similar forums before on malay rights and if we dont stop them today they will do it again in the future
2431571 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2431572 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2431573 hillary was very clear during the primaries and ever since after eight years of failed policies she and barack obama want a new direction while john mccain will offer more of the same its funny how he neglected to include those words in his ad
2431574 hair brings ones self image into focus it is vanitys proving ground hair is terribly personal a tangle of mysterious prejudices

2431577 criticism starts it has to start with a real passion for reading it can come in adolescence even in your twenties but you must fall in love with poems
2431578 i had said that i would participate in the debate if that is the only way to find out the truth and those responsible for these land scams
2431579 i do not see the relevance of koh accusing me of being afraid when all i want is to get to the bottom of the land scam that has seriously affected our states finances and development plans
2431580 since our argument is about the land scam we should stick to the topic im willing to debate on other issues but it should be in another forum or debate at the moment let us focus on the land scam issue
2431581 how can i retract my statements about the land scam even before the debate and the land scam is a fact that i will never retract when even the former deputy chief minister datuk seri dr hilmi yahaya admitted that the previous government had made a mistake which hilmi accepted full responsibility
2431582 time is a companion that goes with us on a journey it reminds us to cherish each moment because it will never come again what we leave behind is not as important as how we have lived
2431583 nella commissione ho voluto regione e provincia avrei lavorato anche con berlusconi
2431584 sono sbalordito per lindole che trovo un po surreale di questa discussione su un oggetto che non c ho capito che si discute sul fatto se sia bene o male che io presieda una commissione del comune di roma
2431585 ma cosa posso farci se si ignora anche levidenza dei fatti io esprimo amarezza ma non per me esprimo amarezza per altri e sono costretto da vecchio a dire o tempora o mores un centrosinistra che riesce a chiudersi in questo malanimo e non riesce a cogliere la dimensione politica di quanto qui accaduto
2431586 certo il comune di roma voleva dare una visione bipartisan di una commissione sul futuro di roma
2431587 ma io gli ho risposto che la commissione avrebbe potuto essere bipartisan solo se fosse stata espressiva di cooperazione istituzionale tra i tre enti interessati al futuro di roma
2431588 queste sono parole parole che vedo viaggiare nellirrealt rispetto a questa vicenda ho capito che da noi il truman show fa premio su tutto quando uno entrato nel truman show una volta che lha capito non ne esce preferisce restarci come ha fatto qualche altro autorevole giornale italiano
2431589 daccordo lidea iniziale era quella per io lho completamente cambiata e se oggi avessi degli studenti che cadono nellirrealt per una cosa simile dubito che supererebbero un esame con me
2431590 vabbe per che la commissione sia interistituzionale lui almeno lo sa qui sta nascendo una commissione che cercher di definire progetti utili per il futuro di roma perch un paese deve avere unidea univoca il pi possibile di dove sta andando bisogna essere ciechi per non vederlo
2431591 sarebbe stato ancora pi bello che il presidente del consiglio avesse sentito questa esigenza
2431592 gli avrei posto lo stesso problema mi sarebbe stato meno semplice trovare la soluzione ma credo che alla fine sarebbe stato possibile dar vita alla commissione perch no
2431593 io vedo in queste occasioni unopportunit poi se qualcuno dice ma cos stiamo dimostrando che anche il centrodestra pensa beh non ho commenti io non ho mai pensato che la differenza tra destra e sinistra sia che la sinistra pensa e la destra no ho sempre rivendicato da persona di sinistra che rispetto a molte cose noi sappiamo pensare meglio ma questo non vero in assoluto e il mondo non si divide cos o bianco o nero
2431594 meno male vuol dire che anche le ragioni di tristezza sono bipartisan
2431595 s assolutamente la bozza era gi nella cartella di documenti che mi stata consegnata entrer nel lavoro della commissione
2431596 hasanuddin is a very close family friend and he allowed me the use of the apartment for my political meetings
2431597 several of them have been questioned by the police including hasanuddin and the police know we can account for our meetings there
2431598 at a time when the government is running scared about crossovers how can we hold meetings in public

2431605 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one
2431606 we find in the overseas facilities that ratio could be as large as one licensed engineer to 10 unlicensed engineers

2431612 in the evening standard of 6 august we stated that the duke of edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2431613 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2431614 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2431615 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2431616 he was due on the seventh so its almost as if he waited for the exact time to make his appearance hes our first child so obviously he was always going to be special but this has made him unique
2431617 we will make him fully aware of how special he is when he is old enough to understand he was smiling straight away
2431618 he looks a lot like his dad i dont really have any ambitions for what i want him to do when he grows up he can be whoever he wants to be
2431619 having a well respected qsr franchisee like bcorporation introduce krispy kreme in malaysia is an exciting opportunity

2431621 when i saw this film i think sir ben and penelope are just incredible
2431622 most of my scenes almost all of them apart from the ones with debbie harry were with sir ben and it was just such a pleasure to work with an actor as generous as he is to do a moment to moment reality with him was so wonderful because you go here and he goes there with you its just a give or take that was all pluses to me
2431623 we only met a couple of times before just to say hello i met him after gandhi and at parties but we didnt really know each other at all
2431624 i was aware of her but when i saw this film she is amazing
2431625 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2431632 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2431633 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2431634 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
2431635 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2431636 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2431637 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2431638 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2431639 der wahre triumph dieser tour ist dass wir uns nicht gegenseitig erw rgt haben was nicht hei t dass wir nicht dran gedacht h tten
2431640 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2431641 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2431642 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2431643 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2431644 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2431645 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2431646 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2431647 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2431648 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2431649 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2431650 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2431651 the use of some cbrn materials has the potential to have very serious and widespread consequences
2431652 an example would be the use of a nuclear device
2431653 there is no historical precedent for this type of terrorist attack
2431654 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2431655 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2431656 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2431657 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2431658 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2431659 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2431660 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2431661 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2431662 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2431663 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2431664 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2431665 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2431666 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2431667 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2431668 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2431669 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2431670 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2431671 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2431672 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2431673 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2431674 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2431675 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2431676 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2431677 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2431678 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2431679 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2431680 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2431681 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2431682 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2431683 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2431684 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2431685 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2431686 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2431687 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2431688 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2431689 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2431690 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2431691 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2431692 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2431693 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2431694 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2431695 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2431696 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2431697 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2431698 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2431699 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2431700 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2431701 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2431702 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2431703 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2431704 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2431705 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2431706 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2431707 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2431708 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2431709 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2431710 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2431711 honest and sincere we dont need the worlds greatest politician as president we need somebody we can trust
2431712 im perfectly happy to answer that question in front of america and let them judge me
2431713 am i phony or not i think theyll say that im not
2431714 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2431715 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2431716 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2431717 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2431718 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2431806 the whole concept of human rights has become so massively dependent on imaginative interpretations of the law for example from the right to privacy to the right to abortion that there is little knowing where it might finish up
2431807 if moral consensus is the basis for human rights then the manipulation and coercion of moral belief can produce new rights such as those to abortion euthanasia and the cloning and destruction of human life for research purposes

2431811 we get other advocates who want to be like deb
2431812 you cant always teach what deb knows its part of her dna
2431813 if i had a supportive mom thats probably what she would be like
2431814 ive been through shelters ive been through transitional housing ive been homeless i know what the victims are going through
2431815 you dont have to be the typical domestic violence worker to be recognized
2431816 its going all over the world at a furious pace
2431817 he has had the vision to do this for years but i think most people didnt really know exactly what he was going to do until he actually did it
2431818 this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me
2431819 this is for all those who couldnt say anything silenced
2431820 were concerned about his well being of course but we respect our professors and we respect their right to free speech
2431821 he believes in the right of all people and they should be able to exercise those rights freely and without inhibition and he makes that i think quite well known in all that he does
2431822 i didnt really think it was going to be a big deal
2431823 but i think all of the rules are out the window right now with this incident
2431824 he is a very good leader and we just know the word of god
2431825 had to get on the move now im at a kind of amusement park enjoying the day
2431826 hes on the run on the move undercover in china and authorities are looking for him
2431827 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
2431828 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
2431829 why not life is short life is dull life is full of pain why not do something special
2431830 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
2431831 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
2431832 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
2431833 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
2431834 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
2431835 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
2431836 my parents joel and kristy were very happy as well
2431837 my mom hugged me so hard after the race that it was hard to breathe for awhile
2431838 being that it is an olympic year a lot of the olympic athletes that went to china this week were there
2431839 we got to meet them and they were at our meet all day long it was a great experience
2431840 their main emphasis to us in hershey was to stretch more and the importance of staying hydrated
2431841 we stretch here of course as well but they taught us a few stretches that i have never done before
2431842 i am very satisfied with the 6th place finish because i am only 13 and i have been holding my own against the 14 year olds
2431843 to only be one second off the national pace at this time is a huge confidence builder for me
2431844 the main traffic aisle will be a lot wider now than it was before so the traffic flow though the area will be vastly improved
2431845 with the wider aisle access we are now going to re open the old concession stand that is next to the ticket office and under the press box we will now have two concession areas open which will be very good for the fans
2431846 if its such earth shattering stuff whats been going on since 2005
2431847 why is he on the street if they think its that important
2431848 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2431849 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2431850 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person
2431851 usamriid is not like being in a shack in the wilderness its interacting with people in a pretty secure place
2431852 if i even suspected that he was anywhere close to being mental i would not have done the paperwork at all the state of maryland approved him
2431853 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
2431854 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks jeffrey taylor u s attorney for the district of columbia told a news conference
2431855 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation once this process is complete we will formally close the case
2431856 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
2431857 ivins has claimed that he was suffering serious mental health issues in the months preceding the attacks and told a co worker that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
2431858 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2431859 when you are 50 you may injure your body more easily than when you were 20
2431860 joints tissues and muscles may not be as flexible as they used to be so as you get older you need to take extra steps to protect yourself from injuries when you exercise
2431861 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2431862 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2431863 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2431864 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2431865 the best laid plans of mice and men etc etc
2431866 my kids are so much fun to be around and summertime is such a fun time to be with family
2431867 this summer my son is really into surfing so ive dusted off my old surfboard and im out there with him im mainly getting beat up paddling out when youve got a big set coming your arms feel like rubber but you know youre going to get clobbered if you dont keep going

2431872 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
2431873 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
2431874 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
2431875 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
2431876 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
2431877 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
2431878 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
2431879 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
2431880 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me

2431897 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2431898 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2431899 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2431900 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2431901 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2431902 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2431903 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2431904 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2431905 i played my first six years or so making the semis with ease with the bulldogs and to come here and have a couple of tough years has been hard
2431906 the last few years ive looked back and thought gee ive taken finals football for granted
2431907 so to be back in the mix im just really looking forward to playing it again
2431908 i know were going to be there now so im excited about it but i also know weve got another 4 5 games to go so im definitely making sure i dont get ahead of myself
2431909 the broncos are always around in the semi finals theyve got a great team and theyre sort of breathing down our necks a little bit
2431910 if they get a bit of momentum and we lose some we could end up out of the four
2431911 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics

2431915 it was a very special day it was great to finally get out there and play your 300th game
2431916 i have never had so much pressure on myself to kick a goal and ive never wanted to kick a goal more than that it was nice just to get it through
2431917 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2431918 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2431919 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2431920 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2431921 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2431922 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2431923 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2431924 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2431925 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2431926 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2431927 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2431928 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2431929 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2431930 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2431931 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2431932 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2431933 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2431934 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2431935 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2431936 just so you all know we did set a record
2431937 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2431938 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2431939 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2431940 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2431941 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2431942 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2431943 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2431944 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2431945 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2431946 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2431947 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2431948 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2431949 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2431950 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2431951 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2431952 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2431953 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2431954 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2431955 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2431956 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2431957 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2431958 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2431959 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2431960 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2431961 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2431962 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2431963 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2431964 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2431965 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2431966 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2431967 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2431968 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2431969 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2431970 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2431971 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2431972 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2431973 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2431974 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2431975 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2431976 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2431977 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2431978 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2431979 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2431980 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2431981 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2431982 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2431983 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2431984 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2431985 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2431986 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2431987 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2431988 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2431989 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2431990 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
2431991 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
2431992 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
2431993 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
2431994 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
2431995 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors
2431996 what our research suggests is that it might be useful to further investigate influences such as polling location to better understand how such factors affect different types of voting situations
2431997 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2431998 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2431999 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2432000 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2432001 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2432002 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2432003 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2432004 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2432005 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2432006 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2432007 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2432008 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2432009 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2432010 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2432011 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2432012 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2432013 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2432014 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2432015 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2432016 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2432017 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2432018 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2432019 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2432020 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2432021 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2432022 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2432023 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees

2432025 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2432026 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2432027 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2432028 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2432029 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2432030 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2432031 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2432032 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2432033 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2432034 ovunque mi si chiami per parlare del tema dei diritti civili andr e continuer a farlo ma desidero anche pensare al mio lato televisivo radiofonico

2432037 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2432038 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2432039 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2432040 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2432041 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2432042 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2432043 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2432044 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2432045 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2432046 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2432047 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2432048 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2432049 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2432050 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2432051 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2432052 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2432053 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2432054 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2432055 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2432056 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2432057 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2432058 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2432059 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2432060 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2432061 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2432062 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2432063 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2432064 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2432065 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2432066 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2432067 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2432068 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2432069 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2432070 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2432071 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2432072 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2432073 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2432074 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2432075 reading your responses and talking to tad devine the former chief consultant to al gore and adviser to the kerry
2432076 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2432077 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2432078 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2432079 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2432080 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2432081 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2432082 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2432083 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2432084 real results by the end of my first term in office
2432085 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2432086 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2432087 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2432088 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2432089 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2432090 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2432091 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2432092 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2432093 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2432094 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2432095 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2432096 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2432097 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2432098 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2432099 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2432100 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2432101 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2432102 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2432103 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2432104 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2432105 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2432106 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2432107 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2432108 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2432109 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2432110 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2432111 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2432112 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2432113 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2432114 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2432115 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2432116 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2432117 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2432118 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2432119 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2432120 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2432121 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2432122 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2432123 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2432124 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2432125 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2432126 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2432127 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2432128 actually ive created a superhero with stan lee which is based on me and were doing a cartoon right now with mtv
2432129 confessions of an heiress a tongue in chic peek behind the pose
2432130 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2432131 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2432132 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2432133 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2432134 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2432135 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2432136 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2432137 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2432138 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2432139 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2432140 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2432141 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2432142 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2432143 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2432144 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2432145 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2432146 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2432147 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2432148 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2432149 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2432150 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2432151 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2432152 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2432153 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2432154 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2432155 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2432156 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2432157 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2432158 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2432159 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2432160 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2432161 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2432162 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2432163 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2432164 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2432165 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2432166 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2432167 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2432168 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2432169 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2432170 i think she actually could see herself in the white house no not as president but first lady shed love nothing more
2432171 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
2432172 without michelle he wouldnt be there michelle obama youre one hot mama
2432173 oby nikt z nich nie wr ci ywy albo lepiej niech wszyscy wr c jako inwalidzi niezdolni do funkcjonowania w wolnorynkowym kapitalizmie niech te parszywe mendy wr c bez n g bez r k z pokiereszowan g b i wyd ubanymi oczami chcieli cie tam jecha to zdychajcie w afga skich piaskach mo e jako naw z b dzie z was jaki po ytek od dzisiaj b dziemy na lbc wi towa mier ka dej polskiej k y w nato wskiej okupacyjnej misji
2432174 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2432175 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2432176 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2432177 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2432178 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2432179 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2432180 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2432181 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2432182 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2432183 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2432184 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2432185 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2432186 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2432187 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2432188 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2432189 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2432190 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2432191 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2432192 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2432193 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2432194 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2432195 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2432196 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2432197 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2432198 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2432199 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2432200 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2432201 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2432202 after these demands were made the complainant was physically assaulted numerous times
2432203 after attacking the complainant the offender searched through the house before leaving with a sum of money

2432210 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2432211 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2432212 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2432213 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2432214 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2432215 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2432216 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2432217 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2432218 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2432219 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2432220 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2432221 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2432222 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2432223 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2432224 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2432225 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2432226 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2432227 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2432228 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2432229 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2432230 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2432231 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2432232 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2432233 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2432234 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2432235 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2432236 you better hope i never see you outside of this school because i might have to test the law
2432237 with no plan theres no attack with no attack theres no victory
2432238 where the hell am i going to get lawyers from
2432239 its a little childish and stupid but then again so is high school
2432240 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2432241 on monday i paid 7 for a pint now all of a sudden its 7 5 i was shocked i complained to staff they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices
2432242 i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2432243 when brian realized how much he was paying he disputed it we know the governor
2432244 he did say we have prices for regulars and prices for people who dont come here very often he dropped himself in it
2432245 it is not true at all that we fail to have tariffs on display and charge different prices
2432246 the price list is up on the bar now what has happened is some of the prices have changed and it is not correct to say that regulars get drinks at better prices than tourists

2432254 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2432255 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2432256 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2432257 the good christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make empty prophecies the danger already exists that mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man in the bonds of hell
2432258 the human genome provides only scant information the discovery of how microbes in the gut can influence the bodys responses to disease means that we now need more research into this area
2432259 understanding these interactions will extend human biology and medicine well beyond the human genome and help elucidate novel types of gene environment interactions with this knowledge ultimately leading to new approaches to the treatment of disease
2432260 the fecal flora of breast fed infants is so heavily dominated by the probiotic genus bifidobacterium that it is considered the gold standard type of gut flora which imparts excellent resistance to infection
2432261 in formula fed infants no one microbial group predominates rendering the system less able to fight infection
2432262 in biology if you look at groups with large numbers there are very few examples where you have a central agent
2432263 everything is very distributed they dont all talk to each other they act on local information and theyre all anonymous i dont care who moves the chair as long as somebody moves the chair to go from one robot to multiple robots you need all three of those ideas

2432265 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2432266 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2432267 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2432268 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2432269 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2432270 what they dont realize is if they have this kind of genetic make up they are on their way to dependency
2432271 what we dont know is far greater than what we do know
2432272 as soon as we heard about it we put fixes in
2432273 they authorize it almost immediately which is really perplexing what is the point
2432274 these requirements were not mandated by cms and are not a federal requirement
2432275 they dont have a good reason for what theyre doing
2432276 patients have been suffering the consequences of this whole switch
2432277 the calvo family members were the apparent victims of a local drug ring
2432278 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2432279 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down our front door
2432280 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2432281 i am already roasted on one side and if thou wouldst have me well cooked it is time to turn me on the other
2432282 it is very important for any society not to carry arms but that needs a free country without occupation

2432284 i hereby announce the establishment of an ideological moral ethical and cultural mahdi army the armed faction shall be limited to a very few professionally trained individuals
2432285 violent video games have been a problem for a long time
2432286 some parents dont know what their children are playing and are just happy they are not out of their sight but these games can have very damaging psychological effect on children especially games which depict violence so casually
2432287 if the committee decides the games are dangerous we may ask the distributors to halt distribution
2432288 the rate of growth deserves to be studies as a nescessary preliminary to the theoretical study of form and organic form itself is found mathematically speaking to be a function of time we might call the organism an even in space time and not merely a configuration in space
2432289 how can we possibly know what something is if we dont know anything about it
2432290 i am giving up control of this situation because i am faster smarter and stronger than you
2432291 in practice the power of any conspiracy rises and falls in inverse proportion to the power of its internal conspiracies mutual guilt and bribery mainly hold together conspiracies whose ideologies command insufficient loyalty but this makes them vulnerable

2432300 time must be well used this is a basis for a possible theory of ethics
2432301 each time we formulate a hypothesis we take the simplest one possible but what obligates the universe to be simple

2432304 even a small piece of metal traveling at 7 5 kilometers per second can destroy a spacecraft worth billions of dollars
2432305 the number of objects in earth orbit have increased steadily today there are an estimated 35 million pieces of space debris
2432306 if you look at the galaxy data you can see enormous objects hundreds of millions of light years across stuff thats really huge

2432316 i kind of in the back of my mind thought that this would be the fight that they would match up just because demian has been doing well in the ufc getting a couple of wins
2432317 people have been touting him as the new up and comer and i feel like ive been doing well and im kind of one of the guys at the top of the division and i kind of thought that we were on a crash course either him and i or michael bisping and i those are the kind of match ups that im looking for
2432318 im not going to sit on here and kid everybody and say im a better grappler than demian maia
2432319 weve been in training to avoid those bad situations and if we are in those bad situations to be patient and take our time getting out of it my overall mixed martial arts game i feel is better than his and i faced top level competition those are two of the biggest differences in this fight
2432320 im not afraid to take this fight to the ground
2432321 im just aware that if i take the fight to ground he always has that threat to submit you i have confidence in my ground game i think ill be well prepared for this fight on the ground if it goes there im going to try to fight him where i think he is the weakest which is the clinch and if the fight goes to the ground so be it i wont be looking to take it there right away
2432322 everyone is great till they get punched in the face and then the whole dynamic of the fight changes
2432323 in a lot of my fights ive won by submission but i used my ground and pound to set up the submission in the doerksen fight i was able to finish that fight with ground and pound and i really feel like my standup is better than ive been able to show in the ufc up until now i havent had a chance to showcase my standup skills i think with demian maia this will be the time for me to show them the skills that i havent been able to show until now
2432324 ive said it in my first fight and ill say it again dont ever bring me in as someones stepping stone im not going to be anyones stepping stone at this point in my career and at this age how long ive fought to be in the ufc dont bring me in to be somebodys stepping stone i want people to see that im here for the long run to solidify myself as one of the top middleweights
2432325 im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title
2432326 its very very good everything is going great i cant wait
2432327 im just working hard every single day doing my thing lifting conditioning running jiu jitsu wrestle box so far so good
2432328 i dont want to take a break because once youre on a roll you want to fight all the time because when you take too much of a break look what happens look what happened to rampage he took too much of a break between times when youre healthy and ready to go you can fight every two months
2432329 hes an awesome fighter but if i have to fight him eventually im not going to back down to anybody you put me in there and ill fight
2432330 if i wanted to gain weight i can gain weight easily
2432331 i could easily walk around at 170 or 175 i just dont want to eat unhealthy i always want to eat healthy and train as hard as i can all the time
2432332 i love fighting ive been fighting my whole life any time i get a call from my manager its the greatest thrill ever
2432333 its a great match up im going to try to do my thing hes going to try to do his thing hes a tough guy im not going to take anything away from him
2432334 hes a good striker his jiu jitsu is not on my level but hes going to train hard for me i know hes going to train hard on his take down defense hes going to work on his ground game im going to try to whoop his ass
2432335 i have no game plan my game plan is to put pressure on you for 15 minutes thats my game plan if it goes for one round awesome two rounds awesome three rounds it sucks
2432336 some judges only know boxing some judges only know wrestlers or jiu jitsu hopefully my next fight wont go to the judges decision ive been training very hard
2432337 you should never underestimate anybody in the ufc if you underestimate anybody you arent going to go far
2432338 you always have to train hard everyday like youve never trained before i would never underestimate somebody whether im fighting bj penn or rob emerson it doesnt matter i train hard every single day
2432339 im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title

2432436 people of china have every right to host the games olympics because these people the majority of them are not exposed to such openness and such ceremonies and they should enjoy this kind of ceremony but at the same time what we are worried about is that a lot of people are still subject to human rights violations and subject to unbearable torture and repressive measures
2432437 we are here to support the tibetan freedom movement because korea was invaded by japan we experienced the colonization that is why most koreans know the sufferings of being ruled by force many koreans were killed by japanese same thing same dirty history repeats itself again and again that is why i support the tibetan independence

2432469 i think ryan lochte is the best thing to happen to michael phelps
2432470 i used to do a lot of that stuff just for fun
2432471 its like at world championships when i wore those grills thats just me it wasnt me trying to show off its just me having fun
2432472 as a competitor when were both standing behind the blocks we both want to win
2432473 we both love what we do i think when were out of the pool we can both joke around i think we both know when to turn it off and when to focus
2432474 honestly i really dont feel like swimmers feel like that
2432475 i bet there are some but hes so dominant in everything he swims most swimmers are just trying to get second because they dont feel like they can beat him thats definitely not the case with me i always feel like i can beat him
2432476 tenemos que demostrar que la ausencia de atenas 2004 no fue m s que un accidente que no tuvo nada que ver con el potencial del b isbol en nuestro pa s
2432477 es normal que el equipo a batir sea el de cuba pero hay otros rivales que pueden hacernos mucho da o
2432478 estoy convencido que si hacemos un gran papel en los juegos de pek n nuestro deporte habr dado un paso m s en ese darse a conocer al resto del mundo de manera positiva
2432479 cuba saldr victorioso en el b isbol venimos a defender el t tulo y haremos todo por retenerlo hemos hecho una buena preparaci n y por eso somos optimistas
2432480 fue un d a de esos en el que las cosas salen mal el pitcheo no se comport como esper bamos y los relevos fallaron
2432481 no podemos cambiar el ritmo de juego tenemos que mantenerlo ese es el mensaje que nos dej la derrota pero no tenemos ninguna preocupaci n
2432482 esto responde a las caracter sticas de este torneo ol mpico corto y con juegos diarios
2432483 hemos logrado una gran novena y estoy convencido que triunfaremos
2432484 parece que hubo un problema con la pata posterior izquierda

2432490 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2432491 hosting the olympic games has been a century old dream for the chinese nation
2432492 one section required that over 600 performers should have uniform expression in their eyes so they must have exquisite feelings and they have to work very hard
2432493 its womens day tomorrow around the world so they wanted a woman
2432494 the national olympic committees were in agreement but the political powers were not
2432495 fue un evento sobresaliente que combin creatividad y 5 000 a os de historia con alta tecnolog a moderna desde el punto de vista de la organizaci n fue excelente la llegada al estadio el traslado fue asombroso c mo se va a superar
2432496 estaba encantado como lo estuvieron todos los miembros del coi
2432497 el coi hizo esfuerzos para que brunei tuviera atletas pero su comit ol mpico decidi no inscribirlos
2432498 mil c maras 5 000 horas de cobertura transmisi n en 220 pa ses y unos juegos digitales
2432499 cualquier conflicto que estalla no es lo que el mundo quiere ver va en contra de los valores ol mpicos
2432500 el deporte puede unir y ayer lo vimos en el estadio la triste realidad es que hay pa ses en conflicto y el coi s lo puede transmitir el esp ritu ol mpico nosotros intentamos hacer todo lo posible para que se cumpla la tregua ol mpica que es un ideal pero c mo se traduce esto a la pr ctica corresponde a naciones unidas y sus estados miembros
2432501 prometimos ofrecer acceso libre a todos los sitios de internet salvo unos cuantos que pueden poner en riesgo nuestra seguridad nacional y no ser buenos para nuestra gente joven es una evaluaci n hecha por la autoridades y tenemos nuestro motivos para decir cu les son los sitios buenos o malos para nuestros j venes
2432502 i havent said anything about breaking any record or going after any record
2432503 you guys in the media are the ones saying that i have my goals and they havent been published my coach and i are the only two people that know about them and were going to try and work to achieve them
2432504 i think particularly at the olympic level at the top level the pressure comes as much from expectation of what people think you can do as it does from your competitors
2432505 michael is able to basically ignore all of those things which is super hard to do
2432506 i think thats just a very familiar pattern that he does and it gets his mind in a place where it needs to be
2432507 i remember clearly the first time he swam at nationals he swam very very well in the prelims and came back that night and i was very curious to see how he would do the first time in the finals and he just walked out and did his normal routine
2432508 thats very rare that you would have some kid who is 14 up on the blocks stretching and doing all this stuff while the other guys are sitting back in their chairs most kids would succumb to peer pressure and do what the other guys were doing but he just totally did his own thing
2432509 i think its about time that someone else take the responsibility and im happy to pass the baton on to someone that im sure i have inspired
2432510 thirty six years is a long time to be honest if he doesnt do it then it was not meant to be but it does not take away from his greatness hes shown a different kind of courage than i did i was not chasing seven gold medals
2432511 i hope he does it but the odds are against him
2432512 thats not a knock on him but there are always going to be upsets my guess is there is going to be an upset in beijing
2432513 the beijing olympics is gearing up to be one of the biggest events of the year and hackers and spammers will see it as a massive opportunity to compromise the unwary
2432514 members of the public have to remember that they should not open e mails or click on links from unknown sources no matter how many gold medals they are offering
2432515 we are fully anticipating malicious social engineering techniques to exploit peoples interest in this event luring unsuspecting users into clicking on compromised websites and into handing over sensitive personal information
2432516 as time has gone on the criminals behind rustock have adjusted the appearance and sophistication of their messages to become more convincing at fooling recipients into infecting themselves
2432517 se nos ha informado de una violaci n de dopaje detectada por grecia cuyo comit es el que tiene ahora que hacer el seguimiento
2432518 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2432519 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2432520 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2432521 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2432522 now i can see the future for china and for myself we have the confidence to rebuild our home
2432523 when the earthquake happened the ground went up and down up and down
2432524 and then from left to right the stairway broke and collapsed i tried to rescue patients out of here

2432527 ik had deze vroege opgave niet gepland ik hoopte het zolang mogelijk vol te houden maar ik kon helaas niet meer
2432528 er is geen risico die gezichtsmaskertjes hebben absoluut geen zin
2432529 ayer di un pasito hacia adelante y hoy otro m s grande
2432530 he entrenado mal estos d as estaba muy cansado y no me hab a aclimatado bien por el cambio horario y los viajes pero ayer di un pasito m s hacia adelante y hoy que he entrenado con blake otro m s grande
2432531 hace sobre todo mucha humedad pero desde ayer intentamos hacer una cosa nueva y es que cada veinte minutos le doy la raqueta a mi entrenador francis roig y me cambia el grip envoltura de la empu adura con el sudor se empapaba y resbala enseguida
2432532 muy muy r pida la pista tampoco es depende lo que pasa es que la bola es un poco extra a y s da la sensaci n de ser m s r pida cuando la bola va por abajo
2432533 el emparejamiento de dobles es de lo peor que te puede tocar no hemos tenido suerte porque el equipo sueco es muy fuerte pero hay que jugarlo y vamos a intentar sacar el partido adelante
2432534 asequible no hay nada todos los jugadores vienen a dar lo mejor aqu est n los mejores del mundo est claro que si tu juegas a un buen nivel tienes m s posibilidades de ganar eso es lo que intentar ante starace jugar a mi ritmo pero ning n jugador es f cil aqu es un cuadro muy complicado los jugadores se motivan m s
2432535 en la ceremonia inaugural sent una gran emoci n fui muy feliz por poder vivir algo as fue una cosa especial hist rica unos momentos para disfrutar fue algo inolvidable por lo duro
2432536 no coincid con federer pero le vi por la pantalla gigante del estadio esto es todo muy especial vives grandes sensaciones diferentes a cualquier otro torneo todo convives con deportistas de otras especialidades y de otros pa ses
2432537 me gustar a ver otras cosas sobre todo alg n partido de baloncesto de espa a pero no creo que sea posible tendr a que ser eliminado muy pronto y si llego lejos no tendr mucho tiempo para quedarme
2432538 estoy centrado en los juegos ol mpicos no en el n mero uno ni en otra cosa ni pienso en celebrar el hecho de ser el n mero uno celebrarlo cuando tampoco en cuantas semanas voy a permanecer ah no me planteo nada de eso ahora
2432539 los juegos ol mpicos son diferentes a un grand slam y a la copa davis es una competici n que se juega cada cuatro a os distinta a otra pero tambi n muy importante es especial porque representas a tu pa s son emociones distintas
2432540 es el final de curso y es un momento importante est a n el abierto de estados unidos la copa davis el masters series de madrid la copa masters de shangai y otros

2432542 we will not allow the company to mine our land our sacred place any compensation they offer is worthless to us
2432543 le recortaba los retazos que reflejaban sus haza as y se los regalaba guardaba otros recortes para m y entonces me pon a a so ar que yo tambi n era un campe n y me iba a los juegos ol mpicos
2432544 al principio era malo todos me ganaban pero en 1994 empec a mejorar la t cnica s la tuve buena desde el comienzo y por esa raz n nunca me han descalificado
2432545 eran tiempos duros me entrenaba y otros me ganaban me qued fuera de los juegos ol mpicos de sydney y los de atenas y no pod a entender las razones a oraba los triunfos y entonces decid no rendirme y me entren sin apoyos confiesa
2432546 por el calor ser una competencia lenta el ganador marcar 3h 42 minutos o m s y si me mantengo en el grupo puntero despu s del kil metro 40 puede pasar de todo
2432547 mis posibilidades de fracasar son pocas s lo fracaso si no lo doy todo y yo tengo claro que pek n ser la competencia de mi vida y no me queda otra opci n que romperme el alma y consecuencia de eso lo que pase ser bueno
2432548 soltanto in italia si contano come morti sul lavoro al fine di poter dare benefici assicurativi da parte dellinail anche le morti che avvengono per incidenti stradali capitati mentre si va al lavoro o mentre si torna a casa a fine giornata morti che evidentemente sostiene nulla hanno a che vedere con la sicurezza in fabbrica
2432549 il momento di smetterla dice di criminalizzare gli imprenditori italiani se infatti estrapoliamo gli incidenti che avvengono in agricoltura e in edilizia vedremo che in italia la sicurezza delle aziende manifatturiere ai migliori livelli europei
2432550 le dichiarazioni di castelli sono pericolose e prive di fondamento un vero attacco alle norme sulla sicurezza sul lavoro
2432551 anzich cercare dichiarazioni a effetto il sottosegretario farebbe bene a preoccuparsi del fatto che il suo governo sta manomettendo le buone leggi che riguardano salute sicurezza e lavoro nero
2432552 castelli si vergogni di fronte allitalia e chieda subito scusa a tutti coloro che hanno avuto un parente morto o ferito per cause di lavoro
2432553 zero morti per expo 2015 un segnale lanciato al governo affinch in vista dellapertura dei cantieri per la manifestazione milanese si vigili sulla sicurezza proponendosi come obiettivo lazzeramento del bollettino degli infortuni mortali
2432554 castelli e gli altri rappresentanti del governo oltre al business e agli appalti pensino anche al valore della vita umana
2432555 singolare che si voglia estrapolare i settori dellagricoltura e delledilizia perch sono lavoratori di serie b forse perch in questi settori sono spesso impiegati gli immigrati il sottosegretario si occupi di pi delle condizioni delle strade che i lavoratori sono costretti a percorrere e investa in trasporto pubblico anzich in polemiche
2432556 su un tema serio come quello delle morti bianche non bisogna mistificare la realt
2432557 il vero volto della lega operaia le dichiarazioni di castelli sulle morti bianche

2432571 sab a que era un rival muy dif cil y lo demostr en el cuadril tero
2432572 estoy contento con la experiencia de haber llegado a unos juegos ol mpicos donde est n los mejores
2432573 so aba con ganar una medalla pero me falt ritmo de competencia en el ring
2432574 me siento muy frustrado porque desde que clasifiqu para los juegos en abril no volv a competir as no se puede lograr buenos resultados no tenemos ning n apoyo de la federaci n ni de nadie por eso quiero abrirme camino en el boxeo profesional

2432603 this is very useful information from fdf it will help the waste industry and local planners to understand where its worthwhile to provide facilities like anaerobic digestion which is the key technology for material such as food waste i chaired a meeting only this week with around fifty senior industry and ngo executives who have pledged to work with government on ways to increase the use of anaerobic digestion solid facts and figures like these will be a vital way of taking that aim forward
2432604 the results of this survey demonstrate the level of ongoing commitment by fdf members to making a significant contribution to improving the environment by targeting areas where they can make the biggest difference our members initiatives are preventing significant amounts of waste at their sites and it is fantastic that the vast majority of waste that does arise is already treated in an environmentally friendly way we hope that the survey results will send a message to the waste industry to invest more in anaerobic digestion and composting capacity in line with fdfs ambition to send zero food and packaging waste to landfill from 2015
2432605 wrap welcomes fdf establishing a base line on food waste for its members the industry is already taking steps to recycle and recover waste this work also shows the potential for further treatment of food waste using technology such as anaerobic digestion wrap will continue to work with fdf members on further waste minimisation activities and on expanding the food waste processing infrastructure through its capital grants scheme

2432674 i took a view that china was going to be a world power
2432675 my kids started learning mandarin when they were four years old
2432676 when i went to taiwan 20 years ago and opened offices there i was impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the chinese people when they werent shackled
2432677 then in 2001 i travelled again over their major mainland industrial areas and noted that the taiwanese free spirit of business was spreading all through china
2432678 i dont see a revolution coming in china any more than in the united states
2432679 chinese people want change but not the radical change that western commentators imagine
2432680 the economic elite has either come out of the party elite or its been absorbed into it
2432681 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2432682 in the 1960s people werent necessarily convinced they were just terrorised into submission
2432683 now they stress management rather than control because they understand that persuasion is more effective than force
2432684 it does help explain the resilience of communist party rule despite the fissures in society and the corruption of much of officialdom
2432685 in the chinese cultural context a regimes legitimacy is conferred largely by its ability to mobilise this bureaucratic tradition
2432686 that is one of those real tipping points because that is something which they themselves whatever the rest of us think see as a fundamental core national interest
2432687 which doesnt mean necessarily that they will go to using that approach to their overall global engagements theyre going to need the rest of us for such a long time theres still so much that they cant do
2432688 theres no doubt that china saw the games as a sign of their international acceptance and its a good thing that they want it
2432689 in short to use an english expression they should take it easy
2432690 the relay is what i have been working for my time going into the meet is one of the slowest im ranked 45th but i feel confident that i can do well when needed there has been a lot of speculation regarding the make up of the relay team but i am glad that it has finally been sorted out and we can focus on the job at hand

2432692 while the chinese government still hears the same 1990s language coursing around western politicians speeches it knows that human rights at home or abroad dont make the a list of the agenda any more in its dealings with the major powers

2432694 abyei is a very important town because of where is sits
2432695 now there is a great deal of conflict in the region we are warning of the possibility of more
2432696 after the peace we saw schools built and changes happening it transformed south sudan
2432697 now always on the horizon there could be a war again and our progress could all be taken away
2432698 it is a sign of the level of tensions when what should have been a minor incident turned into a full scale battle that is displacing citizens
2432699 what we need now is coordinated international action especially from the members of the security council

2433079 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2433080 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2433081 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2433082 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2433083 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2433084 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2433085 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2433086 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2433104 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2433105 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2433106 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2433107 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2433108 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2433109 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2433110 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2433111 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2433112 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2433113 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2433114 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2433115 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2433116 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2433117 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2433118 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2433119 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2433120 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2433121 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2433122 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2433123 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2433124 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2433125 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2433126 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2433127 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2433128 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2433129 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2433130 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2433131 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2433132 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2433133 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2433134 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2433135 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2433136 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2433137 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2433138 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2433139 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2433140 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2433141 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2433142 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2433143 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2433144 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2433145 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2433146 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2433147 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2433148 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2433149 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2433150 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2433151 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2433152 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2433153 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2433154 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2433155 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2433156 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2433157 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2433158 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2433159 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2433160 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2433161 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2433162 who are open to doing something on the production side
2433163 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2433164 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2433165 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2433166 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2433167 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2433168 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2433169 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2433170 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2433171 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2433172 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2433173 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2433174 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2433175 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2433176 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2433177 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2433178 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2433179 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2433180 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2433181 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2433182 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2433183 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2433184 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2433185 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2433186 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2433189 mr costello said a report by global investment bank goldman sachs which found the impact of the us mortgage crisis could be far greater than thought posed risks to australia
2433190 the report suggests investors may need to cut back lending by us2 trillion
2433191 they are saying that this could lead to a downturn in the worlds largest economy
2433192 this is a very very big risk out in the international economy at the moment
2433193 and believe me australia will not be immune it will take a lot of management to get us through this
2433194 we have lost a wonderful son but we are sure his memory will live on for a long long time amongst his family friends and everybody who came into contact with craig
2433195 we ask that those attending the funeral join us in celebrating craigs life and if some want to wear rugby shirts that is fine craig would love that
2433196 we advise students and their parents to be green and mindful when deciding what to bring do not come oversupplied there is not much space for storage or nonessentials

2433208 last night should have been a defining moment in veitchs career
2433209 es sieht so aus als ob eine bestimmte genetische ausstattung den effekt des ersten nikotinkontakts dauerhaft bestimmt
2433210 wenn diese leute erst einmal s chtig sind werden sie wahrscheinlich ihr leben lang nur schwer vom nikotin loskommen
2433211 zusammen mit der neuen studie scheinen wir hier eine genetische variante entdeckt zu haben die ein dreifach hammer f r rauchbedingte krankheiten ist
2433212 you have the bad people going into these empty houses looking for a free place to stay or a nice place to sell drugs
2433213 they get into these houses and they destroy them and then after the city gets them out they close them up and board them up
2433214 with exposure to an environment that has poor quality air pollutants may trigger symptoms of asthma in a dose dependent manner
2433215 with the high minute ventilation amount of air breathed in one minute seen during exercise the effects of exposure to these pollutants are more noticeable in athletes than in non athletes and likely more evident in people with asthma than in those without asthma
2433216 however a significant percentage of the pollution about 35pct at the olympic stadium can be attributed to sources outside beijing controlling only local sources of pollution may not be sufficient to achieve the air quality goal set for the beijing games

2433248 dear dharmavidya and prasada i sent my previous message before i had opportunity to read your essays in running tide i want to say that i could not agreee with you more they are excellent in content and eventually i will look at the entire lectures and essays unfortunately i have been quite busy trying to compose an essay on propagation for the eastern buddhist journal though i think perhaps you say things in a better way in any case thanks for your thoughts and good work gassho al

2433252 it is time for those that have left to pursue greener economic pastures to return home to find prosperity here
2433253 the cows of bashan on mount samaria you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands
2433254 one of the things im always interested is the exhibit area its phenomenal
2433255 you can see products you may not even know about things that can certainly benefit municipalities
2433256 things like that are always resourceful tools we can bring back to our communities
2433257 were extremely good at borrowing ideas from each other and theres no downside to that
2433258 if somethings working in lafayette it might work somewhere else
2433259 i see no reason why a year from now that this cant be the most famous dance club on the planet
2433260 everybody from baseballs dusty baker to actor robert duvall has been here they already know about it
2433261 i dont see why it cant be in los angeles or las vegas tokyo and london this is a lot bigger than a dancehall
2433262 at that point i said i might as well dream big and might it like a new old richards club
2433263 this is the core no matter what people will come here we are drawn to this place
2433264 the musicians are drawn here so you will always have the best here this is their most coveted battlefield if youve got richards youre the man
2433265 we dont need to make a million dollars on the zydeco hall of fame
2433266 were businessmen and we do want to make a profit but i think about my grandparents who danced across this same floor
2433267 i know things went well considering the major changes that we went through
2433268 i know we did have some hiccups but things are being worked out as we speak
2433269 buses that are tied to an elementary school they have to tag those babies and make sure that theyre on the right bus
2433270 its a shame the children had a great attitude and this is what happened
2433271 especially sixth graders who are coming to a new school theyre confused and hungry
2433272 some students were not picked up because their bus came early
2433273 we saw boxes start flying up and then people started saying that cars in the front were messed up
2433274 we pulled into the parking lot and all of a sudden this twister was there
2433275 i hollered for my kids to get back inside and then i saw the back part of the roof come up
2433276 we were just sitting inside and we heard a boom
2433277 we went outside the roof was off and there was plywood next to these cars and some debris in the street
2433278 after the results were announced lord paul went and hugged the malaysian minister
2433279 i pointed out what needs to be done by this cpa the uk will support the new chairman to reach that aim
2433280 quid pro quo which i understand had been agreed upon three years ago
2433281 i just think of all my parents had to go through to make sure we had this idyllic upbringing
2433282 people are already back doing a good job and thats without those big assets
2433283 people want to come back to a village not just a home
2433284 if you want an instant vacation every time you step out to your back yard and i hear this time and time again from my clients rather than just a bunch of polaroids that you come home with from your vacation this thing is something thats in your yard
2433285 because what were starting to see a lot more of is people investing more into their backyards since theyre staying home more
2433286 people are asking for habitats for animals that dont have water readily available a pond becomes a place for those animals to eat and drink its amazing how many people are interested in that
2433287 a whole lot more than just water its the visual appeal its the sound its the draw of the butterflies
2433288 they get out and they love to watch the fish weve had a turtle move in and we have five bullfrogs
2433289 it really teaches them about nature weve had dragonflies and butterflies that come to flowering plants and lizards
2433290 our rule of thumb is one fish per 200 gallons it may not seem like a lot in the beginning but as the fish grow your pond will seem full
2433291 the plants take in the extra nutrients thus starving algae from being able to get those nutrients
2433292 you have a viewing area down into the pond and right across is the waterfall
2433293 i read the paper out there i read my books out there i sit out there for an hour to feed the fish instead of doing it in 10 minutes thats my relaxation and my space back there
2433294 we do see the demand switching to a pondless waterfall due to lack of maintenance and no liability
2433295 today was a damn good practice it was a fight and it was hard
2433296 we ran hard in the heat the defense thrived in the heat we thrived in the running the offense fought through it if we continue to work like we did today well be ready to play
2433297 and im excited about the opportunity of my damn strong football team
2433298 you could see it today during a very taxing practice
2433299 it was like today when he said watch me im going to practice hard i think we have pretty widespread leadership
2433300 i think the lord certainly helped us in a number of ways last season
2433301 he jean francois may be as talented a defensive lineman as weve had here
2433302 it was a tremendous setback last year when we didnt have him after charles alexander was hurt knee i cant downplay the loss of charles alexander last season when he jean francois speaks people are going to shut up and listen
2433303 he may be as talented a cornerback as ive ever coached as a freshman
2433304 hell play a lot of football for us this year
2433305 weve got to go into the southern miss game with the no 2 quarterback
2433306 i know they are both very capable because ive seen more of them
2433307 the true freshmen have a lot of talent but are still very raw im ready to see how they develop
2433308 i dont want to say anything about a particular player right now
2433309 we have a couple of guys we might be able to help out
2433310 i got a ton of stuff from the experience there are a lot of ways to do things in this game you kind of develop your own philosophies it forced me to embrace somebody elses philosophies and use them for a little bit
2433311 i found some things i really liked and i brought them back to what were doing

2433319 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2433320 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2433321 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2433322 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2433323 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free
2433324 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2433325 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2433326 in no way did i make a call regarding having the trade intervened with my job is to do what is best for my client it was bostons decision to trade him
2433327 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2433328 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2433329 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2433330 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2433331 were going to go with younger guys and give guys opportunities
2433332 thats in line with what our philosophy is going into next year
2433333 its hard enough to find guys who throw strikes and then you get a proven one
2433334 you dont know what were getting for him so you just wonder whats going on but thats not my job to make those decisions
2433335 sure there are times like in 2005 when were swinging the bats great and youre probably not going to steal as many bases
2433336 then there are times like last year we didnt hit very well and we had to try to make things happen but this year the middle of our lineup has been great if a guy goes fast to the plate it may not be the time to take a chance
2433337 ive always said id steal 50 a year if you want me to
2433338 id run every time i get on and well see what happens but thats not the point of it im here to do it when it counts
2433339 hes in a position now where his due is coming
2433340 hes getting the recognition as a legitimate top of the rotation guy for any team in the big leagues thats how i see jeremy guthrie
2433341 i feel that when ive been on the mound the team has been in the game
2433342 the guy works im talking to you in here right now and hes watching video the guy works

2433346 over the years community shield matches have been between ourselves chelsea arsenal and liverpool
2433347 this is different it is good for portsmouth and shows the progress they have made
2433348 they are not easy to play against especially at their own ground and when you look at the progression in their team we know it will not be an easy game
2433349 harry brought peter crouch into his squad so you can see the direction of the partnership with defoe
2433350 those two will be a handful for anyone hopefully we can cope
2433351 certainly in the u k and europe as far as we know
2433352 one of the tempting and really exciting prospects is that the find might fulfil the theory that the sons of nobility may have been sent to rome or sent abroad to undertake military training or to complete their education
2433353 it was all part of the empire building process of that time to secure loyal high status client kings in the countries that were to become part of the roman empire
2433354 when i create things i almost have to dumb it down a little because low record sales for me is seen like a failure

2433356 hosting the olympic games has been a century old dream for the chinese nation
2433357 one section required that over 600 performers should have uniform expression in their eyes so they must have exquisite feelings and they have to work very hard
2433358 its womens day tomorrow around the world so they wanted a woman
2433359 the national olympic committees were in agreement but the political powers were not
2433360 i guess fabian washington was worth that fourth rounder ozzie newsome general manager gave up
2433361 it was good to see frank too we got two corners out there that are really essentially backup cornerbacks playing like starters and thats huge for us
2433362 also a truck and trailer has jack knifed causing further issues
2433363 whilst team gb comprises 313 athletes more than 600 publicly funded workers will be attending the games including government ministers press officers local councillors and policemen gordon brown is expected to travel to beijing with 20 staff at a cost of 114 000 whilst the department of culture media and sport will send 13 people and other government departments another 11
2433364 the taxpayer is also footing the 240 000 bill for 39 metropolitan police staff to go on a fact finding tour in beijing while dorset police will send four people to find out how to police the 2012 sailing event and greenwich council which will help host the gymnastics in 2012 in the o2 arena is sending six officials at a cost of 14 000 the london development agency whose remit is to attract investment to the capital has spent 3m to hire out a private members club in beijing for the duration of the games new london mayor boris johnson considered axeing the venue altogether after being horrified at the original 4 6m budget
2433365 by far the biggest british contingent at the games will be the bbc which has sent 437 staff at a cost to the licence payer of 3 million the record number is 33 more than the corporation sent to athens
2433366 in the continuing absence of a fully costed plan there is not a firm basis for taking forward the wider security arrangements for the games or for making sure that wider security requirements have been fully reflected in the planning and delivery of other activities within the london 2012 programme including the construction of the venues transport and staging
2433367 given the uncertainty over potential cost pressures on the village project and the ongoing consideration of alternative ways to finance the deal
2433368 the continuing legacy planning could affect the assumptions underpinning the olympic delivery authority budget and the specifications it has agreed with contractors with any late changes impacting on time and cost or on deals negotiated with developers
2433369 you couldnt pick a more difficult site its the main entry to the olympic park and the major roadway to the stratford shopping centre most of the major services to the site pass through it its the most contaminated part of the site the power lines go underneath the canal runs round it we have found the most archaeological remains here and its flood prone in addition to all that you decide you want to build an iconic venue
2433370 edward leigh the conservative chairman of the committee said the department
2433371 at the same time the estimate of the extent to which the private sector would contribute funding towards the games has proved little more than wishful thinking
2433372 there is no single person in overall control is there for instance this is a recipe for arguments and delay particularly between whoever happens to be secretary of state and the mayor
2433373 both contracts are target cost rather than fixed price as it would not have been economically viable to seek to secure this
2433374 translation a housing project costing many hundreds of millions is going ahead on a wing and prayer with the taxpayer picking up whatever financial consequence may arise current cost meter reading to date according to the report the main venues are currently running 106m over the supposed final final costs agreed last november naturally the dcms disputes that arguing the over run is only 16m but thats only because other bits of the project have been hastily canned to balance the numbers just one teensy problem with that the canned bits include items that will almost certainly have cost knock ons further down the line eg exercises to contain costs and achieve savings have inevitably reduced planned spend in areas that are vital for legacy such as landscaping early business planning has already identified the need for additional investment in the park to achieve the standard and quality of legacy park the lda is also concerned about potential shortfalls in the transformation budget for venues it is not clear that the existing budgets will provide turnkey legacy facilities at either the stadium or aquatic centre
2433375 organisers of the 2012 london olympics have block booked 1 925 rooms in some of the capitals most exclusive hotels for international delegates and their spouses at a cost of 10m top officials have been allocated 345 suites costing up to 3 000 a night at six park lane hotels including the dorchester the hilton and grosvenor house half the bill will come out of the coffers of london 2012 the games organiser in the most expensive block booking in olympic history
2433376 the officials in london will be given the use of a fleet of 3 145 chauffeur driven cars despite the promise of a
2433377 bovis lend lease which was selected last year to construct the 2 billion olympic village in east london is struggling to raise money to finance the project a severe lack of credit in the banking system and fears of a property price crash have made it very difficult for any company to raise such a large sum sources claimed that the problems were so severe that it was possible that taxpayers would have to provide more funding for the building plans
2433378 ken livingstone the mayor of london and tessa jowell the olympics minister signed a memorandum of understanding last year stating that at least 1 8 billion would be raised in land sales after the games the lda now fears that this figure based on a 16 per cent per annum increase in land prices in stratford east london over the next 15 to 20 years is too optmistic it told the london assembly last week that it now plans to raise 800 million leaving a 1 billion shortfall about 675 million of this had been due to go to the national lottery to repay money lent to the games this money could now be lost land agents contacted by the times said yesterday that even the lda estimate barely enough to cover the 650 million cost of the land and based on a 6 per cent rise per annum could be too optimistic with the current flattening of the housing market savills the estate agents suggested that urban land values in east london on and near the olympics site may rise by only 4 to 5 per cent per annum over the next 15 to 20 years
2433379 arts organisations which have already been squeezed acted angrily to the latest news
2433380 it was bad enough when we heard the lottery was taking a hit of more than 1 billion but if it now turns out there is no chance of getting any of this money back that would be a disaster
2433381 as a result of this afternoons statutory instrument which we will vote against the grassroots sport budget will be cut by over 100 000 for every parliamentary constituency enough to fund a 100m grass sports pitch or a floodlit multi use games area for each one
2433382 costs associated with the remediation and disposal of land and buildings within the boundary of the olympic park including fees and holding costs relating to those disposals
2433383 bin laden aint a real muslim real muslim doesnt kill innocent people he just made us look bad in front of medias
2433384 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

2433388 my initial reaction was that this was funny very funny but after trying it a few times i thought this is a better mousetrap it is extremely sanitary and it feels good what more could you want from a toilet seat
2433389 i know it isnt as sexy as some other new products in the home improvement or health care market
2433390 but spaloo is something that will affect everyone who uses it every day thats why i took a chance and started a company to sell spaloo in the u s were truly building from the ground up we have no investors no large amount of capital i just believe in this product and my wife is behind me
2433391 whos flying this thing oh right that would be me
2433392 ill be home for christmas signifies the beginning of the christmas season for me when i was little my dad would begin our christmas season by bursting into song this song could have been considered his signature song now that he is gone i use the first time i hear it on the radio as the beginning to my christmas season
2433393 some of the memories that came flooding back to me were my first day in high school my last day in high school and even my first trip to a
2433394 and then all of a sudden during the dreaming tree like a ton of bricks memories started flooding into me i thought about my first ever show on my 19th birthday at meadowbrook and how that concert brought me back in touch with a soul sister i remembered traveling to lansing toledo columbus oh i thought of all of the people i had shared this magic with in the past i remembered the first time dave came to pine knob and jessica kelly amp i danced all the way back to our cars after the sweetness ended
2433395 i once told an ex boyfriend that if he could sing jesus etc like jeff tweedy i would fall in love with him

2433438 consumers have and continue to respond strongly to internet products and services that are customized to their interests
2433439 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2433440 bloggers or families who want to occasionally post content are generally subsidized by the advertising business model through free or reduced cost hosting and also through the ability to have text graphical and even video ads appear on the site
2433441 this ability to make money while sharing views increases the number of viewpoints that can be taken in public debates and surely enriches our public conversation as a nation and as a global society
2433442 no one is saying that there cant be targeted marketing

2433456 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2433457 that much of testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith need to be aired to the public and in the press
2433458 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2433459 with gods help and the prayers of many supporters we have and continue to endure it
2433460 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2433461 no alimony thats what im talking about its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2433462 ignored the publicity and grandstanding and focused on the facts
2433463 it was an ordinary case except for the two names on it
2433464 dealt with this as a couple splitting nothing more nothing less
2433465 not only is matos still capable of earning an income again after such a short marriage but the period during which the couple enjoyed an extremely high standard of living was inherently temporary
2433466 they would not have had personal assistants housekeeping managers groundskeepers and a residence provided them at no cost
2433467 it was apparent that he can rely on mark odonnell his partner to provide for him
2433468 he is underemployed because of his desire to return to school
2433469 during those four years hundreds of people who were privately experiencing the same pain reached out to me for support encouragement and guidance
2433470 in the future i will continue to help people who are victimized by those they once thought they could trust

2433472 in looking at campaign ads in this years presidential nominating election prominent campaign ads were more negative than in previous races both parties featured open races with a large number of candidates and the result was negativity levels that were above the historic averages this finding raises the question of whether this falls general election will provide the quality of political discourse needed by voters according to an analysis of prominent nomination ads 61 percent of the 2008 democratic ads were negative compared to 43 percent of the republican ads both rates are higher than the average ad negativity of 31 percent for democrats and 36 percent for republicans in nominating contests from 1972 2008 prominent ads were defined as those attracting major media attention

2433485 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognized clinical nomenclature is not being used
2433486 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
2433487 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
2433488 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
2433489 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
2433490 what i proposed is that we deal with their specific concerns rather than this emotional image of criminals walking around brooklyn heights which of course happens every day
2433491 in terms of the kinds of work we do we can do a lot of things like altering our schedule to make this work but we need to get down to the very specific

2433508 we dont use that word frustrated weve been on the other side where we are always down looking up trying to win a game only just to stay a game back were on the opposite side of that were still in first place we have to keep looking forward and go out there tomorrow and get a win
2433509 its kind of like it wasnt meant for us to score
2433510 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2433511 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2433512 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2433513 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2433514 u s stocks are applauding the sharp pullback in commodity prices
2433515 it means lower inflationary pressures and basically gives a tax cut to the consumer
2433516 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2433517 the circumstances of mannys final hours with the red sox
2433518 we are not optimistic that he will pitch in 2008
2433519 but we really would like to have lews opinion on things because hes familiar with tom any time tom has had elbow problems hes pretty much seen lew i think lew is real familiar with his makeup and the kind of things that are going on i think after monday we can get that opinion we can really lay out a solid plan of care
2433520 i think right now flash is just trying to gather his information and figure out what is best for him
2433521 we have not talked about surgery nobody has even mentioned whether he is having surgery i think for him right now this probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and figure out where hes heading
2433522 i drove a little faster to get home and pack last night and had no problem getting up at 6 45
2433523 my wife kicked me out of bed this morning she didnt even drive me to the airport she got a car for me
2433524 we want him to go down and start on a regular basis
2433525 this time of the year and where were at its hard to get him work and develop in our bullpen
2433526 hes a starter and like i told him today he could be a good self evaluator and see how much hes improved hes going to be a starter in this league and its more than likely going to be with us
2433527 excluded your client as a subject or target of the investigation
2433528 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2433529 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms
2433530 we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
2433531 didnt do anything wrong its just that he could have done it differently
2433532 its like it wasnt meant for us to score it was one of those nights
2433533 there are ups and downs that happens through the year in a game like this you just tip your hat to the other pitcher he pitched a great game
2433534 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2433535 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence
2433536 it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2433537 i dont feel sorry about things that didnt happen its reality thats the way it goes
2433538 i was in a bad area for a signal and my phone said call lost
2433539 i hurt my groin about a month and a half ago and just havent pitched much since then when i got activated off the disabled list everyone else was throwing good and there was pretty much no room but i feel good well see how it goes from here
2433540 hes got experience hes very useable and hes been there
2433541 i think hes going to get to pitch quite a bit and hes going to help us when i listened to him talk he feels like hes ready hes healthy and hes ready to go
2433542 im very happy im with a team in first place and i couldnt be more happy with the situation
2433543 well have a better idea of where hes headed with this after that
2433544 lew knows more about his anatomy so i think that its important we get another opinion on how were going to proceed
2433545 right now flash is just trying to gather his information and try to figure out whats best for him we have not talked about surgery no ones even mentioned if hes having surgery i think for him right now its probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and see where hes heading
2433546 obviously im disappointed you never want to go down but ill get some innings in and get back on track and stay on their radar
2433547 happs going to play in the big leagues and more likely hes going to pitch with the phillies
2433548 it was slow to hit me but that moment is finally here with all the phone calls from friends that makes me realize this is something more special its mind boggling to me
2433549 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2433550 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2433551 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2433552 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2433553 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2433554 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2433555 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2433556 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2433557 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2433558 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2433559 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2433560 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2433561 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2433562 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2433563 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2433564 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2433565 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2433566 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2433567 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2433568 this year alone ive bought several of the products that i reviewed in my column so here it is pogues list 2008
2433569 as the four hour ceremony progressed a game of digital whack a mole took place network executives tried to regulate leaks on the web and shut down unauthorized video while viewers deftly traded new links on blogs and on the twitter site redirecting one another to coverage from say germany or a site with a grainy spanish language video stream
2433570 but i pray you will never see anything more awful in the sky
2433571 skeletons unexploded bombs and a noxious smell greet visitors to the site in east london that will host the olympic games four years from now the site which takes up about one square mile once housed chemical factories gasworks and other mucky industries
2433572 gastrointestinal absorption of toxins may be different than that of an adult under similar circumstances finally there are simply physical differences in the physiologic function of children that place them at increased risk for absorption of toxins surface area to volume differences increased respiratory rates etc
2433573 be with us in this occasion and he has pledge it so he was with us in 2004 and i was also in his inaugural in colombia
2433574 yeah it was alright except for when this tiger came out of nowhere and ripped my leg off otherwise it was good i am kind of tired though maybe its the morphine drip

2433577 cada um que passa em nossa vida passa sozinho pois cada pessoa nica
2433578 from a personal point of view obviously a goal is great because theres going to be great competition for places in midfield
2433579 i want to play every game and a goal helps me in that direction but its down to the manager to pick the 11 thats going to start the first game of the season
2433580 thats what you need especially in the championship the season is long there are a lot of games and if you dont have competition for places i think you can lose the edge a little bit
2433581 youve got to keep the edge in the team and thats the best way to do it with competition
2433582 youve really got to fight for your place but then again the team spirit is really good as well and everybody respects the gaffers decision whether youre playing or not
2433583 when players get injured or suspended you need that depth
2433584 well have a good team and hopefully we can challenge for that play off position
2433585 a little more consistency in our play last year and it would have brought us there quite easily
2433586 we just needed a bit of an edge to get us in the play offs
2433587 the first week was really difficult because we did a lot of training at the club and with the games coming up quite quickly in america
2433588 but in my opinion its the way to get in shape and do it quickly
2433589 everyones had some minutes i think its been a good pre season and with the amount of games coming up i think well be ready when our season starts
2433590 i think were at the right place i think its been planned out quite well by the coaching staff and theyve got it spot on
2433591 we had heart monitors through the summer and i think they were quite happy with how we came back after the summer break
2433592 it started off about two years ago at the beginning of my testimonial season at partick thistle i thought itd be a cool idea to have my name on my gloves to commemorate the season up there
2433593 it started off as a small process and i thought instead of your own name or initials what would it be like to have your own logo and then your own gloves
2433594 glasgow caledonia was only a couple of miles drive from partick thistles ground theyre both right in the centre of glasgow so it was possible to have a full time football career and train in the morning and fit in lectures in the afternoon or go to night classes
2433595 it was difficult at the time but it actually worked out well because it meant that i had some time away from football when i was at university and vice versa
2433596 it was nine or 10 months of testing with about 30 different materials from different manufacturers all over the world
2433597 my underpinning of the project was that i wasnt going to release anything onto the market that wasnt of a professional standard it couldnt be something that i wouldnt use myself in matches or training sessions that was the hardest part
2433598 and i went back to the drawing board five six or seven times
2433599 but now i think weve got a professional pair of gloves that are made from the best materials and are really affordable
2433600 it started off as something i put some of my savings into and i received a little bit of funding im still going to play for another 10 years hopefully so its something that i can afford to do as well
2433601 hopefully i can learn from my mistakes that people make with any new venture and build the business up
2433602 the clubs ive played for have always played good football that is the only way to play
2433603 youve seen the way i played at milton keynes and macclesfield i want to play exciting football i want a strong team and i want to entertain people i want to entertain the fans
2433604 if i can improve on the 58 points attained last season then it will be a step forward im excited im looking forward to getting my teeth into it
2433605 we are a top 10 side mark hughes has done an absolutely fantastic job and its up to me now to continue that and improve that and i want to keep my best players and keep pushing forwards
2433606 it takes time to build the team that you exactly want but weve got to stabilise the club i think this year will be a learning curve for me just like it was for mark hughes when he first came here
2433607 weve got to be looking at being in the top six weve got to be looking to challenge for europe every year weve had a taste of it before and we want a taste of it again
2433608 we missed out last season and now it is down to me and my staff and the players to make sure we can achieve that year in year out
2433609 my standards are very high and i expect the players standards to be very very high standards are very important
2433610 ive been brought up on that under sir alex ferguson john lyall at west ham and glenn hoddle england and i expect the same in all my teams
2433611 i didnt surprise myself last season i got asked that many times
2433612 i had a hernia from christmas onwards and struggled and in my opinion i dont think i had a great season
2433613 if im at it and work hard there should be more to come
2433614 i set myself a goal target at the end of last season for this season i like to do it early
2433615 i dont come out and say what it is but to reach it this year will be a real task and one im willing to work towards
2433616 i didnt reach my target last year i was a good way off i set myself a tough target but you have to you dont want to reach your target at christmas
2433617 there will obviously be a bit of pressure but sometimes pressure can be a help and bring out the best in you
2433618 im looking forward to the pressure ive never wilted under pressure and never will
2433619 id love to have scored a hat trick every game in pre season but to be honest youre better saving it for the season
2433620 its always important no matter what the game is to score goals as a striker or a poacher and you just have to try and score as many as you can
2433621 ive done alright in pre season but thats all scrapped when the first game comes along
2433622 id like to think i try to be a perfectionist but if you watch me play i dont think im a perfectionist at all
2433623 i make many mistakes but i like to be the best i can every saturday and if im not im not happy
2433624 hes scored a tremendous amount of goals in his career and if someone has scored that many goals you listen to them
2433625 a few things he has said i have already taken on board and it can only help me
2433626 and with the forward players we have though its going to be exciting
2433627 the way the team play there will be chances and its down to me or whoever plays to put them away
2433628 the gaffers kept everyone guessing as to whos going to play and whoever does has to cement themselves in the team
2433629 im sure whatever personnel are involved will do just fine
2433630 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2433631 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2433632 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971

2433642 for decades the approach to maintaining healthy animals was to wait for signs and symptoms of disease to occur and to counter the challenge with an array of drugs which were toxic for the disease causing agent
2433643 transfer factors are truly the missing link in the nutritional approach to preventive medicine for all pets it is a powerful immune system activator that has the ability to boost the immune system in an entirely different way
2433644 most of the chronic diseases we commonly see in animals and humans have an immune basis e g diabetes allergies asthma thyroid disease inflammatory bowel diseases repeated ear infections cancer etc while they can be cured through the careful use of homeopathy the road to cure can be a long one often years if the animal has had years of disease transfer factors can significantly shorten the course by giving a much needed balancing effect to the immune system if the immune system is overactive as in allergies ear infections asthma diabetes or hypothyroidism transfer factors can balance this overactivity so the system is not attacking its own organs overreacting to things that shouldnt be perceived as a threat if conversely the immune system is under active as in mange parasites viral infections or cancer transfer factors can clearly stimulate it to better meet the challenges it needs to be alert to
2433645 the answer is yes probably both i think the main thing is vaccination confuses the immune system as i point out in my so it could go either way or alternate over time between the two transfer factors should be given before and immediately after vaccination for at least a few weeks to help ameliorate the confusion when someone is faced with a mandatory vaccination or has decided they want to give one by priming the immune system with transfer factors the immune intelligence should be less confused though im not sure thats measurable
2433646 transfer factors has been a remarkable addition to my veterinary practice
2433647 transfer factors make up a highly concentrated immune messaging system designed by nature to transfer immune programming from one individual to another both human and animal alike
2433648 transfer factors are the most exciting discovery in immunology as the 21st century unfolds transfer factors will be one of our greatest keys to health and well being

2433693 the poor do not choose poverty it is at once their affliction and our national shame the children of the poor and there are many are the most helpless victims of all and find even less hope in a society where welfare systems from the very beginning destroy their chances of a better life
2433694 chronic levels of poverty polarized job opportunities low wages and unaffordable and inadequate housing in large cities create a fundamental challenge to the future of canada and the quality of life of canadians

2433712 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2433713 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2433714 i really wish they would just let the process go through well win the whole thing is very unconstitutional theyre violating the canada health act and women dont have equal access to abortion in this province they do not
2433715 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
2433716 our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful it will do so
2433717 i go to tonys on the pier for dinner and you always take it for granted its going to be there
2433718 they got him just in time when the story came out he decided he had to take off

2433720 i was shocked i was floored he had anything to do with anything like that
2433721 it doesnt help with the losses but nonetheless provides some measure of satisfaction that he has to pay some penalty for what he did

2433740 trent reznor of nine inch nails has been in talks in with hbo about making a two season maxi series out of

2433742 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are in to it its been a fun thing
2433743 i just pitched it to hbo two weeks ago in l a it went great ideally were trying to get them to do a two year limited series i prefer that over a film we would have a second arg tying into the second album and ties into the series and they all happen together with a budget needed to pull that all off there would be a tour down the road the record completes the story the ending that no one knows i know what happens i knew when i started it and its not what people think

2433748 there is something almost in our dna that triggers autonomic and sometimes extreme responses to foreign criticism or put downs

2433752 anyone who offends the powerful han will be destroyed regardless of the distance
2433753 this is the real china it is not a great power so it wont have a relaxing fun and festive attitude like a great power beijing is too heavy too tiresome this time the performance of the government and people really changed or reinforced my understanding of china to put it plainly we have the isolated mentality of a small country we cannot take criticism we care about face too much we really just talk to ourselves we especially do not know how to communicate with others on an equal footing we are not a great power so dont cheat ourselves by saying we are a great power instead we mix arrogance and inferiority get all confused and cannot do anything in a normal way
2433754 just the movement downward in oil over the last couple of weeks i view as helpful in the whole equation
2433755 we are planning to spend a great deal of time looking at that over the next couple of months
2433756 it is for healing wounds burns or cuts things like that
2433757 we are now interviewing different distributors to get this product to market
2433758 novachem had an excellent relationship with mr lee at dalhousie and weve continued to work with him since 1993
2433759 we would continue to play an active role with kytogenics on their board and potentially for additional support in the future
2433760 over the course of this upcoming year we plan to work towards optimizing evolving and transforming our business
2433761 we still expect general industry fundamentals will continue to be anemic
2433762 certainly has been quite a drop quite beyond the norm
2433763 that has a lot to do with the pullback in commodity prices which improves the outlook for the u s economy a little bit
2433764 it is getting hit a little more so than some other currencies in recent weeks
2433765 we had the horrible employment report that cast doubt on the sustainability of canadas economic expansion
2433766 the general sense is the canadian dollar will weaken over the next year alongside moderating commodity prices
2433767 were looking for it to get to about 90 cents us by the end of next year
2433768 we think it will stay around there maybe even weaken a bit further
2433769 weve seen a lot of the commodity based currencies suffer during this period of the sharp reverse of fortunes in the price of many sensitive commodity prices mainly oil and natural gas
2433770 more and more investors are coming to the conclusion that this could be a much more protracted economic downturn than had originally been thought
2433771 at least temporarily this dollar decline is a commodity play our currency is viewed as a proxy for commodity prices and oil is the bellwether here
2433772 suggests the canadian dollar should be somewhere in the mid to higher 80s cent range
2433773 overall the majority of people would have seen significant gains and the contract would have provided union protection
2433774 i think it was a very good agreement by no means a cadillac agreement but a very good first agreement
2433775 the canadian economy is clearly downshifting in response to the downturn in the u s and the past run up in the canadian dollar
2433776 is not easy on workers and their families and i want them to know that i share their concern
2433777 canada is feeling the impact of global economic factors that are beyond the control of any one individual or government
2433778 however canadas economic fundamentals remain solid canadas labour market has outperformed that of the u s since the start of the year while over 70 000 jobs have been created in canada the u s has lost over 463 000
2433779 would be devastating to our economy in this challenging period
2433780 while canadas fundamentals and economic policies put us in a good position to weather this economic storm we must focus on becoming more innovative and more competitive
2433781 creating an environment that encourages investment and spurs further job creation is the key to a stronger economy
2433782 anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements and statistics canada surveys are finally catching up to that reality
2433783 canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether
2433784 we are completing the work on the pearl seas vessel as and when engineering and design instructions are received
2433785 we believe we are meeting our obligations to the customer
2433786 in our opinion the delay is due to a lack of manpower and other internal shipyard matters and not as mary keith says only doing work as engineering and design instructions are received
2433787 and that translates into a vacancy rate of 36 per cent
2433788 the fond belief that companies will pay the large premium common in the pre 1990 recession era for a central business district location no longer holds true
2433789 we dont have the auto sector troubles that they have in ontario but i still think were going to see an impact
2433790 they are shedding jobs by the thousands in financial services and banking and investment banking and all the related things real estate
2433791 at one company their ceo is now gone and that was a major major company
2433792 they are focused now on cutting back what it means is it makes our job a lot harder weve got to do a better job
2433793 now look guys nows the time you guys in new york need to look at ways to get good people and save money and you know halifax is a good alternative for you

2433842 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2433843 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2433844 we were able to determine that the aircraft came into the trees next to the river at a very steep angle
2433845 on examination of the wreckage its damage is consistent with the aircraft not being in control just before impact
2433846 we know there was a mechanical problem because of the loss of control but it was not a problem thats associated with ongoing maintenance or design
2433847 the aircraft was damaged by equipment thats not normally on the aircraft when its in flight
2433848 well likely get a propeller expert to join us in the disassembly of the propeller hubs and from there well determine whether we need to go into the engines
2433849 we have good information on what occurred in the operation of the aircraft but we always have to ensure that the mechanics as we are able to determine were functioning properly we dont suspect the engines but we have to do that anyway
2433850 i had to pull my truck into the ditch to avoid him and we passed about five feet apart from each other
2433851 i could hear the wheels touch down beside my truck as he landed
2433852 i dont think he had much of a choice at that point it doesnt sound like his options were closing in fast on him
2433853 it was a bit of a close encounter but no injuries to anyone no damage
2433854 from our perspective were just happy that everybodys walking away from this
2433855 we were fixated on this plane coming in like a deer fixated on the headlights of a car coming at it
2433856 looking up and seeing especially two boys i remember the look of horror it must have been pretty terrifying for them
2433857 this has been a very involved sensitive and complicated investigation
2433858 these were kids were who taken from parental custody family custody for a variety of reasons and also youth who had been charged with criminal offences
2433859 he actually joked with the attendant that he looked like the male pictured on the front page of the paper
2433860 the lawyer for the family has notified us of his intent to drop the legal action
2433861 the wrha is reviewing the golubchuk case to determine what if any changes need to be made
2433862 whatever was afoot he did not know what anybody elses plans were or might have been
2433863 he was saying from his heart that he didnt know of any plans to attack canada he said that repeatedly he said that sincerely and he said that quite credibly
2433864 these guys were like religious people i dont think they were like planning to do something against canada
2433865 we just dont drink it its a bit frustrating because sometimes its not even fit for washing or anything else
2433866 i dont drink the water anyway because its not fit
2433867 it must be the chlorine or some damn thing i use it only for washing or bathing or something like that sometimes the colour goes off when it rains other times you can just smell chlorine
2433868 there could be irreversible damage it depends on what stage of the pregnancy its identified
2433869 ideally they would like it that the only thing the new entrants can pick up is people who already dont have cellphones which is a lot tougher sell
2433870 its going to be tougher for the new entrants especially if they see most of the subscribers when they move into the market already locked into three year contracts
2433871 i suspect that what some of the carriers might be trying to do is to get folks to sign up for extended contracts over the next year
2433872 theres going to be lots of choice out there lots of opportunities to get really good deals and find all sorts of devices and i would imagine there are all sorts of services that i havent even begun to think of i think back to school next year there are going to be come exciting offers
2433873 since those phones are normally quite expensive they will heavily subsidize them in order to get people to come in and get longer term contracts
2433874 i dont think that practice has any thing to do with the new entrants
2433875 i would do it if i were them i would try to make sure that my customer base is more secure and offer something in advance of a new entrant such as a globalive being out there its going to take time to build our network so they might as well get a jump on us
2433876 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2433877 canada has sought assurances that mr khadr under our government will be treated humanely
2433878 its yet another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid trial
2433879 now we know that the canadian government has known about facilitated and helped cover up the torture and abuse of a canadian citizen
2433880 this is no longer just a matter of government policy
2433881 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
2433882 que ver con un pa s comunista en el que existe la censura
2433883 art culos para prensa escrita o p ginas web o hacer un blog donde comenten sus impresiones sobre los jjoo durante su periodo de estancia en la villa ol mpica
2433884 the best response i heard this guy was doing 67 in a 55 mile an hour zone
2433885 i stopped the car he flipped open his wallet like on star trek rolled his eyes up and said beam me up scotty it tickled my funny bone
2433886 seguramente los ministros se equivocaron pero apelen a la corte suprema y seguramente all les va a ir bien

2433911 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2433912 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2433913 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2433914 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2433915 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2433916 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2433917 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2433918 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2433919 un interlocutor v lido que en este caso ser a o el ministro de gobierno jorge tobares o alg n funcionario de alto rango con poder de decisi n
2433920 la comunidad de bonifacio a trav s de su presidenta nos ha denunciado que el lonco agust n ancu n alba est haciendo correr el rumor de que nuestro vocero del comit de defensa del mar boris hualme se ha vendido a la empresa celco por la suma de 300 millones de pesos y que habr a dejado la vocer a de dicho comit
2433921 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2433922 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2433923 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2433927 we were amazed at the actual number of infections that can be averted by expanding access to treatment
2433928 ugandas electrification stands at about 9 nationally and 3 in the rural areas meaning that electrification in most parts of the country through grid extension in the near future is still a far cry renewable resources are one of the important ingredients for enhancing growth and rural transformation and we have taken measures to develop and promote renewable energy as an integral part of ugandas energy future
2433929 many people are buying solar energy for their homes or their businesses for they have realised that besides putting the dark days away they can save money with the solar systems and also make more money with the solar business packs
2433930 to support the bustling renewable energy industry we have provided technical and management training we have since started the ultra solar franchises and we already have eight in different parts of uganda we hope to add five franchises soon as we endeavour to spread throughout the country
2433931 the industry needs some regulations but sadly even our umbrella organisation the uganda renewable energy association is in limbo it died out as soon as the donor project phased out it is now a free for all business
2433932 they tell customers that the 100 watt panel can work for six hours but when the customer reaches the village the panels cannot stand the time interestingly when they go to report the anomaly these fellows insist on funny clauses in sale agreement thereby cheating the customers what rightly belongs to them a professional company cannot engage in such practice
2433933 not any equipment can run on the pure sine wave and modified inverters but they operate seamlessly on pure sine wave inverters
2433934 it supplies the highest quality power to run expensive and sensitive household appliances its user friendly operations and low maintenance costs are added advantages
2433935 evenings are the busiest especially when the casual labourers break off from work all of them come to take a shower before boarding to go back home bathing brings in the biggest source of revenue and women are the biggest customers
2433936 we provide customers with toilet paper soap and water for hand washing and they keep coming
2433937 we have to ferry water from alternative sources to the toilet facilities using drums which is expensive
2433938 all one has to do is to come to kcc and identify a place they want to develop we inspect and give the necessary approval for development
2433939 this is an acceptable we cant allow this to happen let them vote in my absence how can all key posts of a national party go to one tribe
2433940 once you play tribal politics in an already multi tribal society what do you expect you destroy villages and families
2433941 2008 is a year where we have become more divided it is going to throw the country into chaos this should worry ugandans
2433942 that capacity is got from their geographical regions this builds tension
2433943 kinsmen as an obligation to his lineage group in return for which he gets his individual rights
2433944 tribe means a group of people speaking a common language observing uniform rules of social organisation and working together for common purposes
2433945 tribalism has come to mean the exclusion of the majority from enjoyment of goodies and the promotion of the interests of a particular group defined by reference to tribe or lineage
2433946 what we are seeing has been built over the years the only difference is that there are now parties which are a platform for almost anyone
2433947 the problem is those people who think that elections are right only when they are the ones elected that is why we have so many small parties there are those who cannot even think of being anything other than party presidents
2433948 not everybody can be a prime minister a vice president a minister
2433949 if say a muganda should take the position chairmanship the next question will be which muganda the buganda caucus said the position should be filled by beti kamya if that demand were to be placed before a national council muslims would say she maybe a muganda but she is not a muslim
2433950 if you fill that position with a muslim and there is no catholic the catholics would say what about us all these are realities which have been created over the years by sectarian incitement of people for political support these are factors that we must deal with
2433951 not at all this should be stopped politics is a win win game it is choosing leaders on merit that will develop this country and we live in harmony
2433952 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2433953 i havent really been surfing for about 10 years and in those 10 years the body has forgotten and lost a lot of capability
2433954 its a whole other kind of nature in north carolina
2433955 but i love this nature best the ocean is especially lovely
2433956 you dont just stand on them you have to get up there fast and thats what im working on the most because in 10 years the ability to go from lying on my stomach and jumping up and getting in a position where im in balance is no longer automatic
2433957 because i heard you could surf an hour away from university
2433958 so i decided to come out here and instead of just travelling do both what my parents wanted and what i wanted and i just stuck
2433959 theres a feeling of excitement when the waves are there
2433960 theres a feeling of being close to nature and theres also a little bit of fear because you could hurt yourself or others and its the breathing in of the ocean i think has a lot to do with it its a wonderful outdoors experience
2433961 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2433962 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
2433963 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
2433964 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2433965 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2433966 i used to work for a rodeo contractor who carried a pint of whiskey in his pocket at the end of the night hed say whiskey for my men and beer for my horses that always stuck with me
2433967 it took 10 months to write the beauty of the whole thing was watching it come to life
2433968 tom skerritt really liked it he said whoever wrote it knows the south he said people dont pay attention to the dialogue anymore
2433969 to be working across from them for several days was a thrill for me i was thinking if they were here writing a song with me and trying to sing and not very good at it id be thinking that they have a long way to go i hope they dont feel that way about me but im sure they do
2433970 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2433971 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2433972 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2433973 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2433974 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2433975 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2433976 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2433977 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2433978 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2433979 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2433980 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2433981 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2433982 put out the light and then put out the light
2433983 look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee
2433984 day and night my fancys flight is ever with my jean
2433985 you got a heart like a stone baby thats why i take you for granite
2433986 i think it reinforces the fact that arguments against extradition had no merit and that he is continuing to avoid the inevitable
2433987 it is a very significant intrusion case because it reinforces the fact that a lone individual who is motivated can cause significant damage to the military preparedness of this country
2433988 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
2433989 it would show him to be much more deliberate methodical and vindictive than otherwise
2433990 i would imagine that the government is going to try to show that hes not this eccentric but that he is using that as his cover story where his real motivation is attacking the government and the military because of us policies
2433991 the government through mckinnons admissions is halfway to the goal line but still has a ways to go

2433994 this is actually an act of genocide removing me my identity theyve taken away our legacy thats an act of genocide its terrible
2433995 its all to do with valuations and rates theres no maori land sold so it doesnt create a value its only european and they pick up their money and go and those values are reflected on maori land so something has to be done you cant just cant meet your commitments unless you develop but of course you cant now develop because youve got very restrictive zones on maori land
2433996 nga waka federation with hector busby and ben mamaku to korero to the samoans and the many other cultures that have a takitimu connection the takitimu festival will also be hosting the maori music awards and we certainly want to be there to tautoko that
2433997 we have a very good and long standing relationship with ngati awa and we will work through the runanga and as appropriate work with hapu depending on what the project is in terms of this particular project we had been working with ngati awa on the design of the fence and once we recognised we made an error we went back and worked closely with ngati awa ti mitigate what happened with us digging the post holes on the site

2434001 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2434002 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2434003 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2434004 ja wir waren schon entt uscht sie hat eigentlich gut geschossen und ist nur knapp nicht ins finale gekommen
2434005 damit hatte ich berhaupt nicht gerechnet zumal der wettkampf optimal begonnen hat

2434007 vier jahre plane ich in meinem alter nicht voraus wer wei ob mirs dann noch spa macht doch bei der wm 2010 in m nchen will ich auf jedem fall dabei sein
2434008 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2434009 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2434010 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2434011 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2434012 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2434064 based on what you have heard or read about the surge of u s troops in iraq that began last year do you think the increase in the number of u s troops in iraq is making the situation there better not making much difference or is it making the situation there worse
2434065 in general how would you say things are going for the u s in iraq very well moderately well moderately badly or very badly
2434066 if you had to choose which do you think is better for the u s
2434067 do you approve or disapprove of the way george w bush is handling the situation with iraq
2434068 regardless of how you intend to vote what would you prefer the next president do about the war in iraq
2434069 do you think saddam hussein was personally involved in the september 11th 2001

2434076 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2434077 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2434078 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2434079 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2434080 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful
2434081 as a cameo of how not to handle a crisis the fiasco over stamp duty takes some beating if chancellor alistair darling had set out to paralyse the housing market he couldnt have done a more effective job
2434082 urgent action is needed to kick start the market but the labour government is dithering and their spin and speculation over stamp duty is further undermining the market by making buyers wait and see if gordon brown genuinely wanted to help he would instruct his ministers to use their powers straight away to suspend home information packs
2434083 people want normal politicians and david miliband is more geeky more like me david cameron could wear a baseball cap whereas miliband would find it harder to appear normal i must have a word with him and give him some advice dont try to be normal when you arent as i never want to be leader of my party again i dont have to try to be normal any more
2434084 the governments equalities agenda has been beset by delay and indecision and this latest mishap proves that they still cant agree on even the basics

2434090 this would make the party vulnerable to future subversions by its political enemies
2434091 nobody can force another to commit a wrong a perpetrator should not give excuses or justifications in blaming others for exposing the moral wrongs
2434092 any tainted leaders by bowing out resigning is not enough they still have to face the testing of our cultural and social norms governing their behaviour
2434093 of late i have come across remarks in view of the party elections that certain quarters or individuals are trying to subvert psychologically our cultural or social norms by saying that an apology can cleanse a person of any morally wrongdoing
2434094 a perpetrator has no right to impose upon others that he has been cleansed by an apology he or she has no right in accusing others guilty for exposing the moral wrong he or she has committed
2434095 i was one of the few members of parliament who had in 2001 launched a community website previously for ampang jaya parliamentary constituency
2434096 to paint cohen as racist and as a jew who hates christians
2434097 majority of australians think the country is taking too many refugees
2434098 i have been unable to attend many regent meetings due to my own job responsibilities and feel i am less than what i should be in regard to that commitment
2434099 for some reason his constituents could never focus on how loyal to the party he was and it created this strange phenomenon with him always having to struggle
2434100 really because of one issue immigration people were able to define him as not being as conservative as the overall data would suggest
2434101 im not a rubber stamp and there are too many rubber stamps in congress these days
2434102 people just want to follow whatever their party leadership tells them
2434103 both the left and the right like to beat up on me
2434104 matheson is going to have more like minded people around
2434105 as long as these party unity numbers stay in the 90s i think congress will continue to be a bitter and inept place
2434106 congress inability to tackle any of the important issues stems from this point they dont vote independently
2434107 wasnt acting in self defense that he was the aggressor in the case
2434108 but we have a responsibility to safeguard those federal funds and we cannot put those federal funds in jeopardy by assisting people with criminal records
2434109 millard county is the only legal entity in utah recognized by the nevada state engineer
2434110 that what im going to be doing going forward likely will be so different from what i did in my first 64 years that its almost like a different life now time will tell if thats true thats the way it seems to me for today
2434111 but i feel like ive got a lot going for me right now and a lot of its up to me
2434112 i think it was very important for the employees to see physically and mentally that hes there and recovering and improving
2434113 i could go to another realm and explain to you what i think happened
2434114 im done take me out in the west desert and leave me
2434115 if you knew some of the details of some of the side issues its pretty remarkable im here
2434116 its very hard for him to just be a consultant or an adviser
2434117 his nature is to get right in the middle of whatever the issue is and try to resolve it himself thats going to require a level of discipline from him that i really havent seen in the past
2434118 i believe that if there was ever an event that would cause him to act differently its what hes been through the last 59 days and i think hes had a lot of time in the hospital to just reflect and consider what he wants to do going forward
2434119 shed come over to my house to talk and just be friendly
2434120 when youve opened up more at factory butte when you have routes in wilderness study areas and when you have wilderness quality lands youre just throwing out the windows yeah we have to object
2434121 the hope is it would keep the people on the trails and out of the actual cactus habitat
2434122 the housing trust fund money will only be a very good thing for the state
2434123 we just dont know how much or what the specifics are
2434124 it had a flat tire it was like mine but crappier
2434125 people are looking for alternate forms of transportation and riding bikes is one thing people turn to
2434126 well go to a pawn shop and see bikes in there but we dont know whose they were
2434127 it seems like people are always getting their bikes stolen its hard to tell if its happening more often
2434128 put it in the house most of the time its taken from the garage or backyard people case garages all the time looking for open garages
2434129 we just want to say we have the right to live here as much as anybody
2434130 we are actively engaged in pursuing several other potential sponsorship opportunities
2434131 the owner wasnt sure if the man was completely naked
2434132 but he came by a short time later going the opposite direction this time he knocked on the window waved at the patrons smiled and kept on running
2434133 it doesnt need to happen its lewdness its against the law and there could be kids in the area
2434134 have i got a deal for you lets each of us bundle all our loans as mortgage backed securities and sell them to one another then we can each start over loaning out 10 for every dollar of deposits and heres the best part we then sell the bundles again in the financial market
2434135 man im sorry about that i guess ill have to say something
2434136 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2434137 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2434138 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2434139 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2434140 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2434141 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2434142 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course

2434146 theres a lot of pressure because you only get one hot lap to get a good lap
2434147 i went out and put my head down and came in and everyone was cheering and going on i had no idea what kind of lap time i did but i knew it must have been good they told me what it was and it was a second faster that ive ever gone before
2434148 we had all the coaches in one room to decide what to do
2434149 we went with a system of runs against ratio that automatically disqualified quebec and advanced glace bay and medicine hat alta to the semifinals with the undefeated british columbia squad
2434150 it was the same situation when we were in stoney creek ont in 1990
2434151 in fact jason bay who plays with the red sox was with trail b c that year and they won it all
2434152 they have been steadily improving since they lost their first two games
2434153 they were just going up and up and i felt they were really going to be tough
2434154 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2434155 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2434156 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2434157 you know somethings happening but you dont know what it is do you mr jones
2434158 but nothing really surprises me anymore it all just seemed a little silly
2434159 your mind just races with all we could do and it is just so exciting for us
2434160 will we have a show like that no will we have a show thats wholly canadian of course it will and it will inspire the world
2434161 but also if they can do that then i can do something as creative
2434162 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape
2434163 its not going to be a mad rush at the end
2434164 it reminds us that the next time our olympic athletes take part in the opening ceremony and the next time the drama of the olympic cauldron lighting stirs everyones hearts as it did tonight it will be at home in 2010
2434165 what a proud night for china and for all canadians as we get ready to be the next host and share that same stage of honour
2434166 bravo beijing on a night of memories for everyone here and watching at home you have shown the world what can be done to celebrate the spirit of friendship and fair play
2434167 we had all the coaches in one room to decide what to do
2434168 we went with a system of runs against ratio that automatically disqualified quebec and advanced glace bay and medicine hat alta to the semifinals with the undefeated british columbia squad
2434169 it was the same situation when we were in stoney creek ont in 1990
2434170 in fact jason bay who plays with the red sox was with trail b c that year and they won it all
2434171 they have been steadily improving since they lost their first two games
2434172 they were just going up and up and i felt they were really going to be tough
2434173 i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2434174 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing canadian flags canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leafs i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2434175 the opening ceremonies were incredible all the show was amazing i didnt expect this at all
2434176 ive never seen a stadium that big it was just crazy waving at everybody ill do it again if its possible
2434177 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada
2434178 the energy was extraordinary as we walked into the stadium
2434179 the dancing the music and all the canadian flags gave me goose bumps i was not expecting something like this
2434180 et susceptibles d couter cette composition l gal des autres chefs d uvre
2434181 sur le bord de la mer appel e dj za r b ni mezghanna les les des enfants de mezghanna maintenant alger
2434182 i want to get a picture of it because its amazing
2434183 its crazy were always together as a team and just to see their reaction its amazing just peoples reaction to kobe alone is crazy i have to walk the other way
2434184 i saw a guy i think kobe gave him an autograph he took off running and laughing and jumping and stuff i thought that must have been pretty special to him he went off to tell his friends about it
2434185 it will probably be the most watched game in sports history
2434186 probably one of the williams sisters ive never met them before couple of track stars u s 400 metre runner jeremy wariner ive never met him before and hes a texas guy and everything
2434187 i remember watching the games i dont know who they were playing but i remember it was not even close
2434188 that was the greatest team ever assembled everybody knows that
2434189 i think we all know whats riding on this and we all want to win
2434190 first and foremost we want to win whether we won the last however many international tournaments we want to win period
2434191 ever since 2002 theyve been emerging theyve been playing together and theyve been talking about the same things i know this because i talk to jose and he says theyre playing their best basketball right now
2434192 i think theyre the best team besides us of course
2434193 this only happens once every four years and ill never see it happen again in beijing
2434194 they changed the date i guess for college people like me and i enjoy it its a good week its a lot of fun
2434195 i see a lot of the guys i grew up watching and they are still around playing so its just a chance to see everyone but i definitely want to win it thats my goal
2434196 i would say that but there are some other solid guys out there too
2434197 i won a few awards here and there i thought i had a good career
2434198 but also mental toughness there are just so many good players down there you really have to be at your best to beat them
2434199 i would say if either one of those guys lost before the final it would be an upset for sure
2434200 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
2434201 bow down before the one you serve youre going to get what you deserve
2434202 i want to fuck you like an animal i want to feel you from the inside

2434206 at the same time we thought we should do our part too
2434207 you get to be with friends and learn at the same time
2434208 i dont believe that anybody should be sleeping in the streets wherever it is so i personally dont believe that sleeping outside can ever be a sanctuary
2434209 from a public health perspective we dont believe were meeting the needs of people by encouraging them to sleep on the streets
2434210 the only alternative is to tell them if you sleep on our park bench were going to have you arrested
2434211 we try to earn their trust and thats a pretty big deal
2434212 they refuse to go anyplace else right now some people do end up going to shelters
2434213 so why have you got a sandwich in your bag
2434214 for starters we learn and relearn forget and learn again that verbal acuity does not translate into high morals
2434215 in the coming days look for representatives of big media organizations to describe how aggressively they were reporting on the edwards story
2434216 although it doesnt look like much the motor produces an impressive 63 horsepower and 133 pound feet of torque
2434217 the power of feeds on facebook is their ability to move you into a world where you receive relevant information in a social context wherever you are on the web

2434225 im not sure theres anything of merit in this idea of the crucible
2434226 but instinct tells me if i can get the right people from different disciplines to spend time together something of importance may come out of it
2434227 thats the hope or feeling i have if it doesnt work thats also interesting if the only way you can pursue your discipline is to isolate yourself from others
2434228 the intensity of five islands retreat stems from the fact you cant get off the island whenever you want
2434229 you can only gain access to the shore at high tide
2434230 at high tide you can paddle a kayak between the red cliffs of neighbouring islands at low tide you can walk on the seabed to the west towards pinnacle island where the birds nest or moose island to the east or you can clam or cave sit in a place which hours ago held 30 feet of water
2434231 we provide meals a room and an ambience of solitude and silence
2434232 there are seven rooms available and reservations must be made in advance we suggest a donation of 35 per day
2434233 sometimes its really hard to write in regular life a lot of writers juggle a lot of things
2434234 most writers write from real need and you do need quiet to do it particularly for a sustained project
2434235 it takes at least a couple of years to write a novel and first novels dont sell many copies
2434236 i dont know a poet who lives by poetry alone in canada most of them teach its a rocky road
2434237 almost everyone there had a full time job theyd all come to recharge the retreat was their gift to themselves
2434238 in some ways it was a wake up call because i realized i probably wasnt ever going to make a lot of money writing we did some really useful exercises you ended up writing things that amazed you we were able to relax enough to allow ourselves to write and be focused and not to let other things intrude
2434239 we critiqued each others work and everyone was very generous and positive at a workshop you realize everyone else is as tormented about their writing as you are id go again because i got such a lovely feeling from being around people who appreciate what youre trying to do
2434240 there are no additives the fermentation is completely natural and we use nothing but a little sulphite when bottling
2434241 for us its important to keep our wine healthy we believe it makes a difference in the wine theres more life in the soil we wanted life in all the soil layers
2434242 its very traditional quebec winemakers are just as hardy as the grape varieties they grow
2434243 this area was designed to flood but wed never experienced a flood this size before
2434244 that comparison has been floating around ive heard that a couple of times now

2434247 theres no two ways about it i need your sponsorship after completing the run for life some colleagues persuaded me that i could do this with them so i thought sod it i will im obviously getting too close to a big birthday and thinking its now or never im more concerned about raising the sponsorship than running the race easy to say in august so please take pity on me and give me a few quid thanks in anticipation
2434248 since i am paying this fine for the heinous crime of saving lives i think i should have a say as to where the money goes
2434249 far too much money goes missing in our system every day with no accountability with this in mind i ask that this money be given to the salvation army
2434250 are about the only organization that is really doing any good for the people
2434251 i ask to be provided with a copy of the receipt from them the salvation army this way i will know where the money was sent
2434252 we expect all fines to be paid to the attorney general
2434253 we tracked them for about 45 minutes to an hour
2434254 but it was kind of hard because i was trying to drive the boat and take pictures at the same time
2434255 i would put it at uncommon but not unheard of
2434256 they certainly wouldnt be resident like the inshore ones off the northwest coast of the u s but they could either be offshore or they could be transients
2434257 neither of those is particularly well studied they would probably range quite widely
2434258 they would probably be in search of food be it seal or herring
2434259 both prohibition and a stay of proceedings are discretionary remedies to be used with restraint
2434260 i am not satisfied there are exceptional circumstances here requiring the granting of a stay
2434261 because theres no guarantee that the pilot project will be 100 per cent effective we will continue to support and protect the high risk patients by providing them bottled water
2434262 the pilot project is just that its a pilot project to see if we will be able to effectively reduce or eliminate legionella in the water so in order to make that determination weve got to monitor the water over a long period of time
2434263 i am campaigning right now to fix the water problem in the vg by having the whole darn building torn down and another building put up
2434264 which buildings do we need to get rid of replace renovate expand etc and then what are the price tags related to those
2434265 i dont think theres enough being done in the area of prevention or training for young workers between the employers and the wcb they need to do more
2434266 you were given the very basics for cash experience and things like that but nothing at all as far as safety was concerned
2434267 so its up to the employer to identify what the risks are in their particular workplace and to ensure that they provide adequate training and protective equipment to all their employees including students
2434268 even when training is provided if youre in a culture such as say the restaurant industry people rush people are trying their best to provide good customer service they do take shortcuts and sometimes that results in injury occurring
2434269 were not sure at this time who the remains are
2434270 understands that it is alleged by halifax regional municipality that her dog has been aggressive
2434271 has shown no aggression whatsoever toward people and is not a dangerous dog
2434272 from all i can tell shes working very hard to do whatever she can to help save her dog i mean its kind of consumed her

2434274 the first time somebody commits an assault you dont kill them the second time somebody commits an assault you dont kill them
2434275 you put them on probation you give them counselling if they need it
2434276 until that time the dog will not be facing euthanization
2434277 i am very sorry for what happened and i take full responsibility but why should my dog lose her life for my shortcomings aside from a few mistakes she proved herself safe around people and most dogs
2434278 she has more friends than i do and she loves her life i feel she and i deserve another chance
2434279 so thats why we put the pipe organ up for sale
2434280 well have to take whatever we can get for it
2434281 it will cost 80 000 to take the pipes down to move them and anyone who buys it needs to know that
2434282 the pipes lose their shape if its not done properly
2434283 can you come in to the office for a few minutes
2434284 do you recall the events that occurred on july first
2434285 on the first of july at chanhassen beach our lifeguards were recorded by fox 9 news they have footage of one of the lifeguards textmessaging extensively and not paying attention to the water theyre goign to air the footage on august 1 but they allowed me to see if beforehand were trying to determine who the guard was in the footage
2434286 i dont think its you she had a blond ponytail you have curly hair
2434287 how dare they how dare they question me like that
2434288 oh my god they have video of me taking pictures of my own boobs oh my god they are going to show it on television shit oh my god im in my swimsuit and i probably look fat
2434289 i was watching the news tonight and it was you
2434290 i had my grandsons with me and we stopped and we went down and sure enough it was gone
2434291 and i walk to school and back home every day

2434296 hope so got to hope so and work to get back but well see im trying to get back before that so i can practice
2434297 my thought is we have a guy like mitch and a guy like aaron that can jump in and take their shots at this thing until marks back in here and battling with them
2434298 this is an opportunity and how we deal with it and how we handle it is important not the fact that something happened
2434299 these two guys are more on the athletic side they really like to get out of the pocket and do things out of the pocket
2434300 we hate that it happened we hate for it to happen like that especially but we got an opportunity today to kind of show what we could do and had to take care of it
2434301 thats because the chinese people sympathise with the plight of the iraqi people
2434302 thats because the chinese people appreciate a country who stands up to the u s a
2434303 it is because the chinese people admire the big stars in the american team
2434304 theres a place for cars but that place probably isnt suburban commuting or grocery trips
2434305 i thought that with male drivers it was inversely proportional to penis size
2434306 you know i really did prefer the sydney 2000 opening ceremony
2434307 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2434308 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2434309 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2434310 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2434311 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2434312 id like to have broken more targets but the heat out here it gets to you after a while
2434313 at the level were at anytime we miss weve made some kind of stupid mistake and thats the way it turned out to be making stupid mistakes here and stupid mistakes there
2434314 det h r r n got som inte hade varit m jligt med tidigare regelverk tidigare hade alla l nder i europa sina egna regler vilket gjorde det i stort sett om jligt att bygga en paneuropeisk handelsplats

2434346 this video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by a third party
2434347 the international olympic committee said it is starting a dedicated youtube channel that will feature extensive video from the 2008 beijing olympic games
2434348 damn we were dirt poor growing up but at least our parents loved us
2434349 we didnt have a lot but we busted our asses and made the best of it we even got to eat at mcdonalds on special occasions
2434350 it had a flat tire it was like mine but crappier
2434351 people are looking for alternate forms of transportation and riding bikes is one thing people turn to
2434352 well go to a pawn shop and see bikes in there but we dont know whose they were
2434353 it seems like people are always getting their bikes stolen its hard to tell if its happening more often
2434354 put it in the house most of the time its taken from the garage or backyard people case garages all the time looking for open garages
2434355 shed come over to my house to talk and just be friendly
2434356 best life is cabrio drive because the sky is the limit
2434357 dass das n pflegemodell in der bev lkerung auf hohe akzeptanz st t das beweisen die zahlen der f rderantr ge und der f rderbewilligungen denn immerhin konnten in nieder sterreich nach dem bew hrten n pflegemodell bereits 890 f rderantr ge bewilligt werden in allen anderen bundesl ndern zusammen konnten nach dem buchinger modell 897 bewilligungen erteilt werden das hei t dass alleine in nieder sterreich genauso viele f rderungen bewilligt werden konnten wie im restlichen sterreich zusammen
2434358 das bisherige verhalten von minister buchinger ist eine halbherzige und kalte politik auf dem r cken der sozial schwachen
2434359 as soon as we heard about it we put fixes in
2434360 they authorize it almost immediately which is really perplexing what is the point
2434361 these requirements were not mandated by cms and are not a federal requirement
2434362 they dont have a good reason for what theyre doing
2434363 patients have been suffering the consequences of this whole switch
2434364 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2434365 we are aggressively going after our tenants that are following behind on their payments
2434366 so that theyll know exactly what its going to take to get their units listed and made available for the section 8 certificate program
2434367 they also have their maintenance personnel out in the villages clearing storm drains in the housing subdivisions
2434368 this is our best guest of whats going to happen we expect the damaging winds of 40 miles per hour to arrive about 7pm monday and then the destructive winds that can blow your roof especially tin roofs through the air about 1am tuesday
2434369 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2434370 hellboy 2 will expand the world of hellboy and surround him with characters both new and familiar as he confronts a deadly threat to mankind
2434371 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2434372 look this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2434373 john edwards was a great champion of working people through the course of this campaign
2434374 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
2434375 if the un secretary building in new york lost ten stories it wouldnt make a bit of difference
2434376 the u s commission has all but erased its credibility as a proponent for human rights
2434377 disappointing that the u s commission on human rights chose a representative with such a shallow civil rights r sum
2434378 i am not a civil rights activist ive never been a civil rights activist
2434379 signal the end of the commission as an independent voice for the protection of civil and human rights
2434380 found a certain number which ended up being around 55 000 voters who we think may have been the same as voters registered to vote in another state
2434381 if the voters are not registered in another state its perfectly within their rights to never step foot in this state again but continue to vote through absentee by mail or they can come back for the elections and vote as long as they maintain their residency here and not register in another state they have every right to continue to vote in louisiana but once they register in that other state thats when it becomes an issue
2434382 the department of homeland security has made it difficult if not impossible to meet the constitutional requirements of providing adequate health care to inmates that have a serious need for that care
2434383 fighting them there so we dont need to fight them here
2434384 since 9 11 the semiotic territory encompassed by the word
2434385 there is something inherently wrong with saying we disapprove of how that looks or we personally find it disgusting
2434386 we are talking about creating one more ordinance one more law that can be used to put more and more young black people into a system that is already eating them up
2434387 my legislation is designed to help young people to enlighten them and help them understand
2434388 i dont think a lot of these young people realize that baggy pants is a message coming out of prison long t shirts is what the drug boys wear when the police pull you over you cant say they are profiling you youve already profiled yourself
2434389 intentional sitting of hazardous waste sites landfills incinerators and polluting industries in communities inhabited mainly by minorities
2434390 are particularly vulnerable because they are perceived as weak and passive citizens who will not fight back against the poisoning of their neighborhoods in fear that it may jeopardize jobs and economic survival
2434391 poor communities frequently communities of color but not exclusively suffer disproportionately from environmental toxicity
2434392 i dont think african americans are paranoid in believing that they have suffered in ways that white people didnt but the prevailing conventional wisdom among white people in new orleans is that african americans had no grievances since katrina they didnt suffer any kind of special discrimination in the rescue and recovery and that there is no merit to their claims that poor african americans were being locked out of the city and being deprived of their fundamental rights that those were all paranoid delusions
2434393 its a classic example of washingtons iron triangle commercial interests lobby the corps and their congressmen for projects that supply the corps with work and political cover and help the congressmen steer jobs and money to constituents and contributors
2434394 we dont do random operations we are targeting specific individuals who are a threat to public safety
2434395 in el salvador we were taught to kill our own people no matter if they were from your own blood if your father was the enemy you had to kill him
2434396 so the training we got during the war in our country served to make us one of the most violent gangs in the united states
2434397 children of central americas bloody wars immigrated to the u s where they became violent gang members then deported back to central america to begin another generation
2434398 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2434399 zanu pf launched murder and blood to protect executive power
2434400 if anyone thinks they are going to go to an air conditioned room to surrender executive power they are dreaming
2434401 the talks have now reached a delicate stage and we dont want any interference why does he want to engage in a parallel process
2434402 mugabe used to be my hero but i now consider him as a political criminal to the zimbabweans who were denied the result of their choice in the recent elections
2434403 it is unclear as yet why the government has taken this action but i think it is because of his connection to zanu pf and his recent utterances to that effect
2434404 keeping an eye on the human element will also reveal important information about the real status of a project esi 2006
2434405 it is very difficult to make a vigorous plausible and job risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method supported by little data and certified chiefly by the hunches of the managers brooks f 1995

2434413 if you live the way im telling you to live then you will have a rich abundant life of blessing
2434414 we immediately enter a zone of confusion or at least i do which will simply escalate from here
2434415 my guess would be about a third of the population would be aggressively pro revolution meaning being for a new society wp about a third doubtful and about a third paying little attention at the time when the balance of power would shift his term for a sort of revolution wp but it is just a guess nothing more as to the army and police i believe that movements for change will be constructing a new society from positions of being able to themselves define and not just demand innovations another albertian term for a nonrevolutionary revolution wp only after the military and police are no longer willing to crush opposition but are instead won over to our cause
2434416 did i hope and try to contribute to good results coming from both those efforts yes i did
2434417 right and now im just about to put the donkey penis into my mouth wait why isnt the donkey dead my agent togmghfgmmmfffglglglglldribbble
2434418 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2434419 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2434420 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2434421 why dont i just put a 9 volt battery into my rolls royce and call it a hybrid
2434422 growing up you never think about any other league besides the n b a

2434425 its strange to see hunger when everything is so green
2434426 in the remaining reports of delirium with impulsive behavior and self injury patients were attempting to flee or escape from windows or balconies and were unsuccessful in their efforts
2434427 fatalities have occurred in adult and pediatric patients in japan the onset may be abrupt and fatal events have occurred even while the patient was being monitored

2434474 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2434475 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2434476 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2434477 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2434478 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2434479 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2434480 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2434481 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2434482 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2434483 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2434484 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2434485 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2434486 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2434487 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2434488 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2434489 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2434490 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2434491 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2434492 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2434493 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2434494 we are prepared to let you our stockholders not microsoft and cark icahn decide what is in your best interests and we look forward to the upcoming vote

2434507 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2434508 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2434509 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2434510 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2434511 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2434512 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2434513 se inicia uma guerra vai perder o apoio de muitos amigos no ocidente

2434515 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2434516 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2434517 they told us kentucky didnt get back very fast on defense and we just went after them
2434518 we try to eradicate social injustices and i think we reform the criminal justice system and make it better
2434519 weve only gone to court for five people claiming they were innocent
2434520 weve gone to court for about 30 other cases and just said there needs to be dna testing
2434521 im happy when it comes back guilty as much as when its innocent
2434522 because in that case it shows the system got it right
2434523 when it comes to dna and eyewitness id reform ohio is not on the cutting edge in ohio you can get dna evidence and then just throw it in the trash without any penalty
2434524 the state is slow to adopt these bills compared to similar states with similar bills across the nation we wont be slow anymore
2434525 there are ways to improve wrong ids and theres different ways you can show photos to a witness to increase the chance of it being correct but police bureaucracies are slow to change
2434526 post conviction dna testing has shown that there are ways you can greatly improve police investigations
2434527 i mean its sort of a myth that dna testing is always being done on the front end
2434528 our goal is not just to get people off we strive to find the real perpetrator
2434529 there could be a murder tomorrow and we cant do dna testing today but 10 years from now well have the technology so we can
2434530 maybe a handful a year were not involved with the investigations post conviction dna testing is an issue between prosecutors and defense attorneys
2434531 we are still going through testing additional information and evidence that we have in connection with the case
2434532 its hard to imagine something worse than being in prison for something you didnt do its your biggest nightmare i dont have any interest in whether the result is innocent or guilty either way we should want to know

2434553 the board has done a business of more than 10 lakhs this time to make the landmark for this years celebration we are very happy to see the public of the city growing the freedom spirit and the love of the nation despite of the panic in the region and it only indicated the growing love for the country and the respect for the tri color flag expressed m kalita addl secretary of the state khadi board every year the board engaged several employees to stitch the national flag in casual basis but this time they needed to increase it to a double than the previous year due to the high sell of the flags we usually keep six or seven women to stitch the flags but this time we are trying hard to meet the demand with eleven women stichers
2434554 we have been taught to respect the national flag and being given the ideology to contribute for the country in our schools and we have no fear to host the tri colour to mark the i day celebration with the rest of the country said roshan talukdar a 9th standard school boy while district authority is also encouraging the i day celebration in public and private sectors by different means of publicity
2434555 i wanted to go to the bank in barmouth and so i rang arriva trains which i have to do every time but no one answered
2434556 i decided to chance it and they let me on but on the way back the two carriages on the train were full
2434557 people were like sardines some even standing with babies in their arms
2434558 i got back ok but it was a bit traumatic as its quite scary on a scooter when you are passed by cars and bikes
2434559 i could understand it in winter but it is disgusting that there were only two carriages on the train as they do not seem to be catering to the holiday season at all
2434560 if a car had come around one of the corners mr wali would not have stood a chance whatsoever
2434561 it is so dangerous when you think this is a 60mph road and the mobility scooter goes 8mph maximum
2434562 we will look at ways of improving our journey care procedures in this context
2434563 it is unfortunate that we are unable to convey some scooter types and i would still urge any intending customers to contact us so that we can make the necessary assessment of their vehicle
2434564 every train we have is deployed to best use over the busy summer holiday period
2434565 in my opinion you cannot know china without knowing shanxi
2434566 you dont know what to expect from day to day if youre going to get food poisoning or if a bus or flight wont show up
2434567 we didnt want the soviets to know wed broken their code

2434570 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2434571 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2434572 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2434573 weve already had 350 students registered and its only 2 oclock
2434574 we will have had several hundred by the end of the night
2434575 it doesnt give you time to get angry at the waiting process
2434576 besides being open all day we are emphasizing how much we care about our students by having a fun event
2434577 today is the big push because its so close to the end
2434578 being able to park here for free have lunch for free and prizes is great
2434579 when i was younger i had absolutely no idea or even dreamed to be in the olympics
2434580 you just never know how your talents will be cultivated
2434581 we have two olympians in the hall and that made me wonder how many other michigan women have competed at this the ultimate level
2434582 when i found out there were 50 female olympians born in michigan and another 50 whod gone to college here or trained here i thought we have the makings of a very special display
2434583 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
2434584 on the surface of it this looks like the rental market should be buoyant but if you consider that many of those renting may be struggling to make ends meet it is certainly not all good news for buy to let owners
2434585 this is one parasite living on another parasite which is really fascinating
2434586 yes the doctor has heard of tri cor and that he would be glad to call in my prescription
2434587 if youre going to start over you want to make sure it can work
2434588 you need a marketing plan you need a finance plan
2434589 im not giving up hope that we can still come to a compromise
2434590 i just cant believe that we would pass up an opportunity like that and shame on us if we do
2434591 were very excited that the city council members have many questions which weve been asking for many months
2434592 were actually thrilled that there are questions we expect real answers to the questions

2434610 this one lingering issue the litvinenko affair is but a glaring illustration of the kinds of problems russia poses to the rest of europe it is therefore time for the eu to agree at least on principle to a common response to these shows of russian aggression the eus population is more than three times the size of russias its economy is 15 times larger but its biggest strength lies in interdependence solidarity and consensus when the next crisis comes all european states will need to be prepared

2434617 weve just got to get him reps and keep him working expectations are high and i really feel like theyre going to be met in a very short period of time
2434618 you guys are my family and ive missed being here
2434619 johnson is doing a great job as we knew he would
2434620 im just trying to catch up get right and compete with him i felt a little rusty but thats to be expected once i get back rockin and rollin hopefully things will be running smoothly
2434621 im bummed i missed out on the bonding time with my team thats a big part of it but im not too far behind i studied so im up to date i just need to keep on motoring get in the film room and correct my mistakes the biggest thing is to keep going forward
2434622 i texted my teammates each night about what was the installation the next day
2434623 i took a gander at it and tried to keep up to date
2434624 hell catch up very quickly and assume the opportunity very quickly unless i can find something major i expect him to play some
2434625 under center itll definitely be my first snap and im looking forward to it
2434626 when youre a backup you never know when youre going to get in there you really have to take advantage of the reps you get in the preseason because who knows when the next ones are going to come
2434627 at this point im extremely comfortable with the offense there are a lot of concepts that have carried over from my career in st louis just in terms of verbiage and everything i feel great about it
2434628 its so important getting everybody together so they can go through this process together
2434629 keiths back in the fold right now and yes i feel real good about the group being together
2434630 im just trying to get through it get healed up and do what they tell me to do they tell me i should be back by the regular season my foots getting better i hope it heals all the way and i dont have any more problems
2434631 i wouldnt say im comfortable but i am more confident im just trying to put everything together its going to be good to have an actual show against somebody whos not used to us to see if i can actually do this or not
2434632 i just want to show i can make plays on the ball and be tough in run support
2434633 yes hes not in great shape yes hes overweight but both those things are changing his weight is coming down hes making good progress and he continues to improve
2434634 its a long season and hopefully we dont succumb to injuries but if so youre going to get a good dose of it similar to a mack truck hitting somebody you know i like it well see how it goes
2434635 guys are saying why the mohawk what did you do it for i said well i had a wild idea this summer i wanted to have a mohawk so i got a mohawk
2434636 the guys give me grief about it but i like it im going to keep it for a while its cool and its different i just want to be different
2434637 my job is to make every kick no matter what the reasoning and i didnt make all of em its not where i want to be but thats obviously what practice is for to get those special situations out of the way and get ready for the season
2434638 for the type of player i am were not going to see each other right now because hes my teammate
2434639 i hit people and hes not one of those guys i can hit so were just talking for the fun of it
2434640 these guys are just so big and then you watch em run and theyre so fast and theyre so skilled
2434641 you just look for everything you observe thats what coaches are coaches are observers and you try to pick up one thing that might help your particular team
2434642 the thing that separates anything in life is passion the passion goes en masse with kentucky basketball
2434643 he just kind of tweaked his knee and was able to come back a la paul pierce of the boston celtics
2434644 the thing thats great with keith is hes a mature man
2434645 you knew coming in he was going to make a quick transition not just from an athletic standpoint but with all the things that go with being a first round pick being an nfl player and highlight rookie
2434646 you did that at coastal carolina you dont do that here
2434647 theyve got a long way to go but the two young tackles are starting to get a little bit better
2434648 theyre like saint bernards youve got to get em going a little bit you know
2434649 its very much preventative maintenance we just want to make sure we dont rush him back out and put him in a situation where it turns into a long term thing which could affect opening day so its cautionary
2434650 theres nothing really serious so dont make a big deal about it
2434651 myself and the dbs are also competitive guys we just use that as an edge to ignite a fire while were at practice to push us along and just make us get better hes pushing us and were pushing him
2434652 its good to be with carson one on one to ask him all the questions about the offense i need to ask him
2434653 its good for him to get back and immerse himself in the team
2434654 hes always raring to go our biggest challenge is to ease him back slowly and dont allow him to do more than he should
2434655 it takes a certain amount of time to get back in football shape
2434656 but he got a good start at it the doctors told us hell be better than he was last year physically as soon as he gets all his strength and flexibility back hell be fine
2434657 when you take a guy as your no 1 pick you know hes going to come in and help you immediately and its a little frustrating when you dont have him
2434658 we can get him schooled up on everything but its this time right now that hes not with his teammates is what hes missing
2434659 going through the things that theyre going through helps bond our football team
2434660 he who cannot draw from 3 000 years is living from hand to mouth
2434661 in bones hove has focused on the neglected sector of our community the peasants and has used a very original device allowing them to speak for themselves
2434662 just as one cannot escape the terrible truth of death or just as a barefoot herdboy cannot avoid the grass hidden thorn in his way so it is with hoves poetry
2434663 it speaks a truth that a historian or a politician or an anthropologist may know the edge of but hove is not an explainer an arbiter or a statistician
2434664 his poetry addresses itself to the human heart because it speaks to the heart its language is concerned with evoking feeling recreating how it was or how it is but never explaining why it is his poetry happens naturally

2434697 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2434698 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2434699 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2434700 i have no reason to be believe that the public is in any danger
2434701 its just so far outside the realm of what i consider possible
2434702 its not going to kill you but itll ruin your weekend
2434703 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2434704 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2434705 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2434706 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2434707 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2434708 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2434709 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2434710 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2434711 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2434712 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2434713 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2434714 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2434715 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2434716 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2434717 this is not a done deal it was never a done deal
2434718 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place
2434719 the next best thing to sitting with a friend over a cappucino
2434720 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2434721 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2434722 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2434723 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2434724 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2434725 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2434726 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2434727 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2434728 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2434729 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2434730 of all the solar system planets has the climate most like that of earth both are sensitive to small changes in orbital parameters
2434731 why dont i just put a 9 volt battery into my rolls royce and call it a hybrid
2434732 eyesonobamas had about 500 000 visitors over the past 3 months of which 61 use firefox 23 use ie and 11 use safari
2434733 in hindsight it makes sense because obama supporters are younger and therefore use a technologically superior browser
2434734 conservative republican they are sadly one in the same now
2434735 so much so that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here
2434736 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
2434737 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
2434738 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
2434739 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
2434740 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2434741 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2434742 what if this whole crusades a charade and behind it all theres a price to be paid
2434743 get out there and get a high enough paying job so you dont need government assistance and my tax dollars but god damn you if you try to take the job that i was born entitled to
2434744 a lot of them come to my section of the store saying they are buying something for their kids
2434745 ms marcon made her money in land development the store was just one her hobbies
2434746 she wanted to offer kids a place to have fun while selling unique products that cant be found anywhere else
2434747 my only request is that i asked them to play with some of the local talent
2434748 by combining real time racing and platform style action with the fun of monster collecting and breeding
2434749 monster racers brings to life a colorful and unforgettable world that has fallen in love with this exciting new sport

2434751 daddy before you were married who told you how to drive
2434752 im not asking you to change your spots im just asking you to take out the garbage
2434753 i used to have my own blog but now ive gone back to pointless and incessant barking
2434754 start the day with a smile and get it over
2434755 this is all a bit phoney i bet they dont dance that well in those scrubby villages would they really have clothes as fresh and bright
2434756 yeah but in 100 years time some latter day tour guide may be saying and in the last century when they still had those huge cruise ships the country folk every summer would come down to the coast and dress up in splendid clothes and dance for the tourists
2434757 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2434758 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2434759 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2434760 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2434761 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2434762 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2434763 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2434764 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2434765 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2434766 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2434767 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2434768 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2434769 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2434770 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2434771 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2434772 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2434773 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project
2434774 it turns out that bridge together with acr is exactly what i needed to organise my images open them in acr and optionally photoshop to perform non destructive edits with the changes and associated metadata stored in sidecar xmp files alongside the original image avoiding the need to maintain multiple copies of images

2434776 the measure of expelling personnel of the south side unnecessary in the tourist area of mount kumgang shall take effect from august 10
2434777 north korea has no grounds for forcing them out unless their stay is against the law
2434778 the south korean puppets however far from coming to their senses are persistently pulling up the korean peoples army over its just self defensive measure and thereby pushing the north south relations to a graver phase
2434779 we want this problem to be resolved soon and not to deteriorate south north relations we hope kumgang tours will resume soon
2434780 the full brigade will go home from iraq we are waiting for the u s side they are providing us with transportation

2434783 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2434784 there are lots of notices that the wi fi network is a hostile network and is actively being monitored
2434785 people are aware that its going on the important distinction is what the expectations are in the media room
2434786 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2434787 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2434788 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2434789 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2434790 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road
2434791 looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at your offices at 123 main street at 3pm if anything changes you can reach me on my mobile at 310 555 1212

2434803 embarq has always provided free technical support for our high speed internet service but recently customers have asked us for support beyond our traditional service to include problems with their pcs
2434804 rescueit sm can enhance the time spent online by providing customers with the professional support they need to keep their computers operating efficiently
2434805 i tried using a computer repair service and software to eliminate a virus i had on my computers but they only made the problem worse i then called embarq and they instantly took away my frustration they were courteous helpful and eliminated the viruses in no time i couldnt believe how good they were i cant say enough good things about embarqs computer support service
2434806 i was having trouble with my computer and called some other support services they said it couldnt be fixed i then called embarq and it didnt take the technician long to fix the problem i highly recommend embarq to everyone
2434807 the same community who demand all from microsoft feel gifted and special when apple give them an inch of rope applications can only be installed from a single source itunes and open source applications and distribution is near impossible how do you install an iphone application without itunes where are the community advocates arguing for a standard interface openess and free code
2434808 all the other products suck hugely apples products just suck a bit less not a huge accomplishment for an industry imho
2434809 will yuse this time an an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to aggressively move into market adjacencies

2434813 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2434814 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2434815 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2434816 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2434817 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2434818 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2434819 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2434820 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2434821 john peel best known for his four decades of music scene radio broadcasting was all the while committing his laconic brilliance to paper in articles and reviews selections of these writings amount to a second autobiography
2434822 the articles were personally selected by peels wife sheila and feature musings on tubular bells eurovision shaving and the loss of virginity
2434823 john peel is best known for his four decades of radio broadcasting
2434824 if we as a society lose our voice completely and corporations start doing all the talking then well be utterly lost to some degree this has already happened our ability to envision a future collectively has already been severely compromised
2434825 im going for walk i may be gone some time
2434826 he calls out as he barrels into his wifes office and shuts the door maureen orth makes a point of leaving no stone unturned and no secret unrevealed view an
2434827 she speaks many languages it must be an embarrassment for the wives of other heads of state to see this beautiful creature who can wear anything and speak like that
2434828 it was a great pleasure to have been able to meet your wife shes a really smart capable woman and i can see why you married her and i can see why she married you too
2434829 are you sure you dont mind i didnt mean to start up again
2434830 shes a kind of alpha female she was never a courtesan like pamela harriman she was more like a female don juan
2434831 ours were not the kind of parents who would spend time with children
2434832 in the power of money maybe because my parents were artists i remember that every time my father had to choose between increasing his business and going to the museum he would go to the museum and i think that was transmitted to us
2434833 what i wanted was to be free independent of my parents
2434834 modeling is a fast acting job right away you get to work and you learn in two or three months by working
2434835 i think it is a major duty for a woman to be independent
2434836 independence was my obsession when i was 20 it was not making money it was making my own money modeling meant i did not have to rely on my parents or a man
2434837 i learned how other people lived i was trying to speak other languages
2434838 modeling has a reputation for emptiness but its not it is certainly not german philosophy but it was very instructive because it was made up of real life you travel you are always alone and you better be well grounded because its easy to lose yourself
2434839 she was full of life and wit she was beyond polite
2434840 so many like linda and christy had periods of being moody and difficult she was always perfect
2434841 shes clever super well educated and very focused she is like the heroine of a book or a movie
2434842 i bore myself silly with monogamy i prefer polygamy and polyandry
2434843 its that i never hide them its a different thing i have not one day of regret
2434844 carlas taste in men has always been fascinating i have never seen a man fawn over carla she chooses her equal
2434845 i have a very good relationship with exes i have a good relationship with all the boyfriends i had sometimes im the godmother of their children im always good friends with their wives
2434846 not jerry hall whom i never met and i was never officially micks girlfriend i was never into his family and all that
2434847 sometimes the desire the passion makes you fight but when that goes completely you have only the good part of it
2434848 do you think your husband is the kind of man who doesnt mind all these other guys walking around in your life
2434849 they are not really walking around they are just walking around in my heart i think it would be a very bad sign to deny everything with denying is sick my own childhood reflects that
2434850 it was not a shock and that is how i knew it was true because i felt calm when he told me that
2434851 i think lies are toxic for children much more than a bad truth sometimes lies when you are growing up make you walk in a funny way to adapt but i felt relieved isnt it strange i stopped feeling weird
2434852 what did you expect me to do go into the nursery to announce this to you
2434853 they just couldnt get it into their mind thats the mentality
2434854 my internet went down and we found he had chewed all the cords
2434855 i dont think she was in the best moment of her life
2434856 she felt very much at a turning point in her life
2434857 we went through the summer and then in september i was alone in this house with my little boy and then i met nicolas on the 13th of november
2434858 of all our politicians he is by far the most sentimental he needs to love he cant live by himself
2434859 he doesnt do medium size things whatever he does he does all the way if he hadnt been like this he wouldnt be president he either shocks or electroshocks people
2434860 with your name and your test scores you will never succeed in france
2434861 by her divorce and that he hated the condescending looks he and his family got constantly from wealthy neighbors
2434862 he had this saying when im not invited for dinner i arrive at mealtime and ring the bell and its rare that they dont let me stay for dinner
2434863 when journalists wrote about him she insisted on being included in all the photos
2434864 from the minute he saw himself with c cilia he saw beautiful modern images
2434865 he thought c cilia was his jackie kennedy that it was politically interesting to have her with him plus he loved her
2434866 she gave advice on personnel she got involved in policy
2434867 as mayor of neuilly in his office he was a man who screws as much as he can
2434868 it is not politically incorrect for politicians to have affairs
2434869 even now 20 years after our first meeting it moves me to say her name
2434870 c cilia and nicolas sarkozy announce their separation by mutual consent they will make no comment
2434871 i was thinking of someone more related to my life
2434872 i was really surprised by him by his youth his energy his physical charm which you could not actually see so much on television his charisma i was surprised by everything his poise and what he said and the way he said it
2434873 then i called jacques and said what did you do
2434874 actually nicolas did call a little later that same night
2434875 your mother invited me to lunch is it all right if i come back sometime
2434876 its a good thing he had seduced many women and she was a kind of seductress when two like this meet it can be good
2434877 i never realized how many nude pictures i did before i met nicolas
2434878 plus i have a body that would allow me to pose nude without being very provocative
2434879 you must know that this is going to come out
2434880 the separation between public life and private life is now dead
2434881 because the president even going back to his campaign wanted to use his wife and family to gain power and he has opened the door for all the papers
2434882 carla is the ghost of c cilia a fake c cilia
2434883 carla and i have decided not to lie its serious
2434884 he was given a warning by the polls and the municipal elections a president doesnt have the right to happiness or if he does it must be with complete discretion
2434885 hes from our generation he doesnt want to lie he doesnt want to have a second family somewhere
2434886 he never thought that our going to egypt would make such a fuss
2434887 its easy to be quieter because we are both exhausted every human being has his way of filling up his life and hes a man who fills up his time maybe its because he is a nervous and anxious man like sensitive people are me im nervous and anxious but i like to relax
2434888 my mistake is that i fell madly in love and did not take the measure of how enormous this was going to be
2434889 i would never have gone to petra i would have said to nicolas you know what we wait six months and
2434890 when you have a relationship with the press no matter what your job is there is only one solution either do not court the press and everyone is free to be unknown and have a perfectly fantastic life without being famous or if you expose yourself it means there is something about you that wants to be there it is not obligatory i was not obliged to be a model i was not obliged to be a singer i could have been a doctor
2434891 its very strange how can i say it a mixed situation
2434892 i dont know if you have ever gone to petra but everyone who goes there would like it it is one of the wonders of the world c cilia became engaged to nicolas 20 years ago and not at all with that ring it came out that she got that ring from christian dior he probably gave her many rings but not that one
2434893 how would i want to have a man who is 52 years old not to have a past he would be a strange man
2434894 just withdrawn his complaint against le nouvel observateur after receiving a letter of apology that airy routier wrote to me
2434895 it took me so much time to write compared to a song
2434896 cocteau said french people are italian people in a bad mood
2434897 i think monogamy is not an idea its a fact
2434898 the anti c cilia on their trip to south africa i saw her smile more in 24 hours than i saw c cilia smile in 15 years
2434899 she makes the president more desirable more modern france needs modernity talent cleverness its like jack and jackie like rainier and grace kelly a new worldwide couple
2434900 she was so young and modern and of course unconsciously i would project myself more like jackie kennedy than for instance madame de gaulle who would be much more like the classical french woman behind her husband there is a great photograph of madame de gaulle serving soup to her husband i do serve soup to my husband sometimes but i wouldnt get photographed that way
2434901 when i met nicolas she sent me a little present
2434902 so i called her and said marie how can you be so nice she said i like you and he looks happy and its been 20 years since we separated i had a hard time with c cilia but i think you can make him happy now we talk once a week and i love her two sons nicolas never dropped marie and always had a strong link with her
2434903 i dont believe in cutting out people from the past it doesnt give strength it just gives loneliness
2434904 i would be delighted to meet and have lunch with c cilia but i think she is not ready and nicolas is not they are still burned by their love which proves they had a very strong love
2434905 she did not have to put up for 20 previous years with having your husband get there
2434906 thats what c cilia got carla is getting the president plucking the flower when it is in bloom
2434907 i get piles of information about what i could do for culture for children education unhappy situations but i need to study i dont want to make the wrong move and i dont want to go up against my husband
2434908 when you are a songwriter and you say i like polyandry ha ha ha it is written down and it doesnt matter but if youre a first lady and you say i like coca cola light its a drama i have to pay attention to every detail and that is very new for me
2434909 id love to have children with nicolas i hope to if i am young enough it would be a dream
2434910 if it comes id be the happiest person in the world but if it doesnt come im not going to tempt the devil
2434911 if life doesnt give me another child well it has given me so much already
2434912 what will the balance be between public and private because she is a public figure
2434913 i was italian how can i be the first lady of france
2434914 quante volte alla vigilia della partenza per le vacanze abbiamo sentito rivolgerci questa frase nonostante la comunicazione oggigiorno ci permetta di essere sempre in contatto con tutto il mondo la
2434915 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2434916 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2434917 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2434918 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2434919 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2434920 id like to see her come out of there in a hearse

2434955 where does the rain fall that it cannot return to the earth
2434956 could you really do that to them cause that kind of pain how many would follow you beyond the veil if you chose that path how many would follow them how many lives are you willing to risk to end your own
2434957 wenn ich die tore im training mitz hle warens 20
2434958 so i cant order a half dozen nuggets but i can order six
2434959 ive changed my mind i dont think ill buy that today
2434960 i knew i should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker now i cant get into my car do you think they pointing to a distant convenience store would have a battery to fit this
2434961 why dont you drive over there and check about the batteries its a long walk
2434962 im almost out of typing paper what do i do
2434963 its the end of the world as we know it and its all the fault of hipsters which probably means you
2434964 we are a defeated generation resigned to the hypocrisy of those before us who once sang songs of rebellion and now sell them back to us we are the last generation a culmination of all previous things destroyed by the vapidity that surrounds us the hipster represents the end of western civilization a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new
2434965 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
2434966 on the surface of it this looks like the rental market should be buoyant but if you consider that many of those renting may be struggling to make ends meet it is certainly not all good news for buy to let owners
2434967 my friend said his band was playing here tonight though thats why i came so theres no band
2434968 this is a stupid question but i am at the rainbow room right
2434969 the rainbow room is in new york this is the rainbow
2434970 absolutely but you cant look at it that way think about this right now your relationship is fun exciting passionate you have your freedom and a thrill at the same time appreciate it for what it is if you dont like the arrangement in a few weeks from now give him his car back
2434971 yeah you know im related to elizabeth the queen im royalty i dont need this
2434972 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2434973 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2434974 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2434975 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2434976 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2434977 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2434978 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2434979 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2434980 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2434981 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2434982 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2434983 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2434984 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2434985 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2434986 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2434987 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2434988 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2434989 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2434990 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2434991 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2434992 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2434993 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2434994 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
2434995 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2434996 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2434997 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2434998 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2434999 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2435000 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2435001 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2435002 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2435003 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2435004 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
2435005 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
2435006 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
2435007 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
2435008 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
2435009 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
2435010 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
2435011 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
2435012 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
2435013 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
2435014 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
2435015 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
2435016 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
2435017 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
2435018 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
2435019 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

2435033 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2435034 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2435035 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2435036 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2435037 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2435038 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2435039 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2435040 personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent
2435041 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2435051 right now its comfortable for the dealers this is the first time all year its been that way
2435052 i would tell you that most margins today are in the 20 plus range
2435053 retail margins are as good as any retail margins weve seen since probably the third quarter of 2006 so very very strong
2435054 this is the first time in a while were seeing some profits in the end instead of breaking even
2435055 we feel great long term but we dont feel good about what the next six months might bring
2435056 while i dont want to make a trend out of a week and a half of august activity volume is very very slow
2435057 lenders want to lend but they want to lend much more prudently than they have in the past
2435058 based on just what weve seen happen in the last five or six weeks we dont think were past the fifth inning yet
2435059 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2435060 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industrywide failure of the auction rate securities market
2435061 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2435062 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar
2435063 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2435064 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2435065 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2435066 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2435067 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2435068 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2435069 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2435070 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2435071 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2435072 incompatible with a civic vision of a dense walkable urban extension of philadelphia to the rivers edge
2435073 the next step includes a conversation with the casino folks about their locations and design issues
2435074 they are very large footprint buildings with large parking structures
2435075 the waterfront vision is about connectivity water access and urban amenities and theres a tension there
2435076 we wont be commenting on it today we havent read through it
2435077 we are in receipt of the report and will review accordingly
2435078 we have legitimate concerns and this report lays some of it out
2435079 these challenges lead to a conclusion that casinos of this program type do not work on these sites and by extension would be better sited elsewhere
2435080 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2435081 the new sign and addition of the dolce brand on top of the hotel solidifies that we are in the home stretch of this major transformation
2435082 the housing slump and the recent turmoil in the financial markets are also distressing the condo market
2435083 the hope now is that the housing stimulus bill signed into law last week by the president will support a much needed turnaround in all sectors of the housing market including condos
2435084 just because someone doesnt love you in the way youd like doesnt mean they dont love you with all they have

2435094 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2435095 rod told us he needed our passports and collected them then he drew rude things on our photos
2435096 its probably because they thought it was too long but when i saw the final cut i thought im not even in this movie
2435097 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him
2435098 he even stopped shooting so he could go to the doctor and get it checked out we all had to wait around for him to come back

2435107 my initial reaction was right when pedroia threw it to me was to go get him and try and tag him before cabrera scored pierzynski was further away than i thought i didnt even think to look home because i thought i was going to get him on the tag its just a play that i made a bad read on and i cost us a run
2435108 georgia a former soviet state sent troops into south ossetia on thursday aiming to crack down on the separatists who want independence or unification with north ossetia which is in russia russia responded friday sending troops into the georgian province where it had peacekeepers stationed
2435109 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2435110 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2435111 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets

2435113 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2435114 philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways the point is to change it
2435115 an implementation is something youve done many times before and doesnt need as much collaboration from the client an invention is something you have limited knowledge of and therefore need an outside collaborator to get right
2435116 and what is particularly amazing is that virtually none of those who support this decision let alone the four compassionate justices acknowledge this
2435117 this lack of acknowledgment or even awareness of how society changing is this redefinition of marriage is one reason the decision was made
2435118 heres another reason to be unhappy with bush he appears to be the biggest regulator since the nixon ford years
2435119 policy discussions of homeland security issues are driven not by rigorous analysis but by fear perceptions of past mistakes pork barrel politics and insistence on an invulnerability that cannot possibly be achieved
2435120 to the list of the next presidents headaches add untangling the reels of red tape that the bush years have unspooled
2435121 for over 200 years this nation has adhered to the rule of law with unparalleled success a shift to a nation based on extra constitutional authority is prohibited as well as ill advised
2435122 the league of nations report of july 16 1925 on the new middle eastern state then being carved by the british from the wreckage of the ottoman empire
2435123 the good intentions of the statesmen of iraq whose political experience is necessarily small it is to be feared that serious differences which in some cases exist in regard to political ideas between the shiites of the south and the sunnites of the north the racial differences between arabs and kurds and the necessity of keeping the turbulent tribes under control
2435124 these difficulties might be fatal to the very existence of the state if it were left without support and guidance
2435125 he promotes a political solution a system based on federalism and divided into states for kurds sunnis and shiites agreement voiced by senator john warner r of virginia who says the kurds have been virtually independent since 2004
2435126 we are pleased that the fda has designated multaq r for priority review
2435127 this follows the exciting results of the landmark athena study that showed multaq r significantly decreased the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations or death from any cause in patients with atrial fibrillation
2435128 these very encouraging results suggest that ofatumumab has the potential to provide benefits to cll patients with very refractory disease and limited treatment options
2435129 gsk and genmab are collaborating on a comprehensive development programme for cll as well as lymphoma which we hope will make a significant contribution to the management of these haematologic malignancies for both patients and their physicians
2435130 we are thrilled to report a positive outcome for the cll patients in this trial
2435131 this also represents a significant achievement for genmab as we now move toward filing of the first marketing applications for a genmab antibody and we look forward to working with gsk on the submissions
2435132 we are pleased that tipranavir showed such a positive efficacy and safety profile in treatment experienced children who have fewer treatment options than adults and need more therapy choices including therapies that have been specially formulated to meet their needs
2435133 there are many children and adolescents with hiv who fail to maintain viral suppression of the disease which speaks to the urgent need for a new generation of therapies designed specifically for this group
2435134 for these treatment experienced children who have had limited options for maintaining an active and durable treatment regimen we now have evidence that tipranavir is effective and tolerable
2435135 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2435136 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2435137 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2435138 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2435139 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2435140 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2435141 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2435142 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction
2435143 as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2435144 i wanted to keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2435145 i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established

2435147 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2435148 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2435149 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens

2435186 dirk did a really awesome job putting the car on the pole it is the first pole in the alms for the team and also for me tomorrow i will try to stay in front and bring a good car back to dirk i think you have to watch your back here a lot with the long straights there will be some action and you must protect yourself from behind i am really confident for tomorrow
2435187 we were quite optimistic about qualifying we knew after practice that we had a good combination and that the car was strong i just got two really good laps both which would have put me on pole position which makes me very happy personally i am very pleased to give tafel racing its first pole position here in this series now we need to switch back to race mode we need to really think about the four hour race tomorrow we need to stay cool and calm and not make any mistakes i am really looking forward to the race this is the best race track in america these are really challenging corners the combination of having corners with not the best grip and other corners where you have massive grip the whole track is very nice and challenging
2435188 alex did a great job in qualifying today in the race my goal is to stay on the lead lap it is so easy to get split by the safety car and go down a lap it is gt2 russian roulette personally i just want to be smooth consistent and not make any mistakes that is how we will get our results
2435189 i think dave fullerton engineer made some good changes in the practice session before qualifying i am certainly the first one to admit that i havent really figured out qualifying in the gt2 car yet i am not exactly sure on the stickers new tires where you push and where you just try and do the same thing you have been doing for me when i get out there on stickers i still have a little too much of that champ car mentality and i overdrive it a bit i am not disappointed but not overly excited the good thing is that it is a long race and there will probably be some attrition hopefully in front of us the weather here is perfect i am looking forward to the race its going to be fun

2435224 were disappointed and thats compounded by the fact that this has happened in four of our five last games
2435225 its something we have to put right weve talked about it but were struggling to find answers as to why we cant get that consistency
2435226 we fought our way into a strong position and if wed batted anything like we can do then we were in the box seat but then it all fell apart
2435227 we were comfortable at 0 0 and then conceded a late goal which cost us we had too many games like that at home and away
2435228 we needed to be more consistent last season instead we were average and thats why we finished 15th
2435229 and theres no hiding from our away form it wasnt good enough
2435230 our home form was as good as any we scored lots of goals and had some entertaining games we did ok but there were also some games when we slipped up
2435231 the new lads have looked good ive been very impressed ive played with them a couple of times now and they have adapted well
2435232 of course they have both played a lot of reserve team football in their careers to date and now they want to step up to first team level
2435233 they both have good pedigree good technique and young ritchie jones has been coached at the best club in the world so he will have all the right habits drilled into him
2435234 you can see alan has an eye for a pass and a liking for a strong tackle he has shown some great passing
2435235 the boys played against him for the reserves last season and they said he stood out with his passing and he was all over the park in those games im sure we will see the same in the new season
2435236 he can come inside from wide into pockets of space and he has great ability in and around the box we saw against huddersfield what sort of talent he has he has a swagger about him a bit like james brown a good body swerve and is full of tricks and flicks
2435237 its going to be a tough league and it seems there has been a lot of money spent in this division with a lot of teams trying to get out of it
2435238 the first target is to go up to hartlepool play well and come back with three points
2435239 the integrity of the rest of the championship is at stake
2435240 im not saying durham deliberately prepared a bad pitch but if theres no penalty they and other teams with strong seam attacks will always want these sort of pitches
2435241 both times we have had a pitch panel in my four years here kent have been involved
2435242 batsmen come here and see one or two balls doing a bit off the seam and they think they have to go for their shots
2435243 this is not sour grapes i would have said the same if wed won
2435244 if we play on pitches like this the game is going to be a shambles and we wont produce test cricketers the pitch panel asked all the usual questions but if the ecb are not going to do anything why waste money sending inspectors round the country
2435245 the ball has swung consistently and sometimes it has slipped off the seam but there has been no extravagant movement or variable bounce
2435246 there has been moisture around after all the rain but there was no obvious sign of moisture in the pitch it was a typical durham pitch but for some inexplicable reason the ball has nipped around
2435247 he wont be the one making way when steve harmison comes back against nottinghamshire next week
2435248 we really want to focus on winning the championship now we had two good opening stands in this match but we need to get more runs in the middle order and get the twenty20 shots out of our system
2435249 kent tried to blast their way out of trouble but slogging is the easy option we didnt bat well either and we have to make sure we improve
2435250 there was no intention to prepare a seaming pitch it was like our friends provident semi final against essex last year it was not extravagant movement but the ball did just enough if the bowlers put it in the right place
2435251 the fans need to know that we will only do whats right for this football club in the short term medium term and the long term
2435252 selling a 29 year old fullback for 6m a year after we bought him for 2 5m and doing so in the knowledge that we will replace him is right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term were already busy working on bringing in a replacement
2435253 people are going to be screaming for curtis to play but hes only just turned 16 so we have to be careful with him
2435254 it can go the wrong way if you play them too much and knock them back
2435255 ive already heard the clamour for him to play and its not just from supporters its from people within the club
2435256 ill assess it if he has one bad game it could knock him for a long time but hes coming on nicely and coming on as a sub has been forcing my hand hes effectively been saying look im here
2435257 michael has been excellent as well but hes only 16 too theyre both young lads who youve got to nurture and bring into the game at the right time
2435258 we want to let the youngsters develop properly but theyve been involved in the first team in pre season and if we cant sign the players we want then well have to play these kids
2435259 if curtis and michael arent going to be involved with me then craig liddle and neil maddison are certainly going to have a good youth team with those two playing up front
2435260 ive already invested 250m in newcastle united and some european nights of football must be the dream
2435261 compared with some of the other owners in the premiership i may be a middleweight taking on some heavyweights but im building the boxer up if you own newcastle you want to win something kevin wants that and so do i
2435262 would i like partners in newcastle of course that would make sense
2435263 you should look closely at what is happening at qpr because im not so sure even roman abramovich can compare to the combined wealth of the group of billionaires they have in charge there now
2435264 so when you are mike ashley at newcastle united then of course you think partners would make sense if i can i would like to start with people in the north east and lets be clear i am not looking to make money personally for selling a stake in this club
2435265 i was at manchester united as a kid even though i signed a scholarship with liverpool at 16
2435266 i went to man utd in the summer holidays when i was growing up i was there from 11 to 15
2435267 it is a special game for me because of who it is i wouldnt say it means anything different to me but at the same time it is always great if you can prove someone wrong so i will be trying to do that
2435268 ive not exactly been known for my goalscoring in the past so im delighted

2435278 what i observed when i came in were a bunch of very tall men encircling a very small woman
2435279 we had to balance out the fact that we had information that we thought was true that brooke bennett used those computers to communicate on her myspace account
2435280 we had to balance that out with protecting the civil liberties of everybody else and this was not an easy decision to make
2435281 the lead detective said to me that they need to take the public computers and i said ok show me your warrant and that will be that
2435282 if youve told all your patrons we wont hand over your records unless were ordered to by a court and then you turn them over voluntarily youre liable for anything that goes wrong
2435283 the idea that they took all the computers its like data mining
2435284 now all of a sudden since you used that computer your information is exposed to law enforcement and can be used in ways that it wasnt intended
2435285 baker wouldnt discuss what information was gleaned from the computers or what state police did with information about other people except to say the scope of the warrant was restricted to the missing girl investigation
2435286 wouldnt discuss what information was gleaned from the computers or what state police did with information about other people
2435287 well if you dont have anything to hide why not just give them what they want to see
2435288 do i really need this bag of chips im sitting here shoving down my throat
2435289 just six weeks after the september 11 attacks a panicked congress passed the usa patriot act an overnight revision of the nations surveillance laws that vastly expanded the governments authority to spy on its own citizens while simultaneously reducing checks and balances on those powers like judicial oversight public accountability and the ability to challenge government searches in court
2435290 the patriot act has directly infringed on many of the rights and freedoms granted by the bill of rights
2435291 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
2435292 the first amendment guarantees us freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom of association freedom of the press
2435293 violates the first amendment by effectively authorizing the fbi to launch investigations of american citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech
2435294 violates the first amendments guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders even where there is no real need for secrecy
2435295 creates a very serious risk that truly innocent individuals could be deported for association with authorizing the fbi to launch investigations of american citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech
2435296 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2435297 the fourth amendment guarantees us freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures
2435298 it ensures that government agents cannot search your house office or other personal effects without probable cause that you have committed a crime as verified by the issue of a warrant
2435299 violates the fourth amendment by allowing foreign intelligence searches for criminal purposes without probable cause of crime
2435300 violates the fourth amendment by failing to provide timely notice to persons whose home has been searched notice is also a key element of due process which is guaranteed by the fifth amendment
2435301 violates the fourth amendment by allowing the government to seize records in intelligence and terrorism investigations without probable cause of crime
2435302 no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
2435303 the fifth amendment guarantees that no person can be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law
2435304 allows indefinite incarceration of persons without judicial review thereby denying due process and equal protection of law
2435305 creates a very serious risk that individuals could be deported for association with political groups that the government later chooses to regard as terrorist organizations
2435306 this isp has refused to help us clamp down on the trafficking of child pornography in fact they are refusing to do anything about it at all this is tantamount to them aiding child pornographers
2435307 the chief called and told me that me and my family had been absolutely and completely cleared of any charges
2435308 he also said that he did not apologize for any action or wrongdoing by the police department although he did express regret about what has happened
2435309 i will not put up with disrespecting this community and using this badge for more than what it is
2435310 ive been here 19 years and this agency has been in existence since 1696 the office of the sheriff of prince georges county has never been under a civil rights review or no one has ever called for the department of justice to come in
2435311 there is no reason there has been no reason and as long as im here there will not be a reason for it
2435312 at that point they see you you dont see them and you dont know where they are thats dangerous
2435313 you really dont have time to deal with that dog you really dont have time to deal with that person you have to secure and go
2435314 that would be the case whether it was the mayors house or anyone elses house a loss of life is always unfortunate that is not our goal
2435315 police chief melvin c high stopped short of apologizing for any action by law enforcement police and calvo said
2435316 oh well we broke down your door shot your two dogs just in case physically restrained and manhandled you and your family we regret that we made a mistake but no way will we say that we apologize and by the way it really pisses us off that youve got the nerve to sic the fbi on us for overstepping our authority
2435317 usenet is one of the oldest computer network communications systems still in widespread use
2435318 in the united states the idea of blocking web sites is not new the
2435319 an internet service provider shall remove or disable access to child pornography accessible through its service

2435322 the tibetans are not reasonnable independance is not reasonnable for them
2435323 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2435324 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2435325 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2435326 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2435327 so tell me about whole diagnosis stuff about these bacterial diseases
2435328 g males can be done with microscopy or you can cultivate the cells p you can test for bile sensitivity or hemaggusomething sensitivity its gram ve so yeah
2435329 hemolytic activity you can do gram positive staining etc and note that it can be hard to grow so this isnt 100
2435330 uhhhhhh lets see salmonella you have to culture it i think same for pertussis one
2435331 well isolation for pertussis and culturing it theres some other thing like polymerase chain reaction blah blah but its not practical yet
2435332 yeah isolation you do selective differential media stuff and identify it
2435333 yeah well you can guess from gi symptoms and the presence of rice water stool stuff you can isolate the bacteria from that
2435334 now tell me about evasion of host cell immune system
2435335 g stuff antigenic variation is a big thing immune system cant catch the antigenic variation the expressed pili pilc is expressed by pile gene e for expressed there that part can switch or recombine with the pils parts secret or whatever so there are too many combinations they can simply change those once the immune system catches up
2435336 let me do this one uh pneumonia uses non covalently bound polysacharride capsule to evade phagocytosis
2435337 vaccines do vaccines can cross react and bind to various types of capsules but even then they can just pinch a part of them and run
2435338 at least you have chance of catching them with antibodies
2435339 cholera well they are the a b toxin thing right
2435340 right b binds to something a1 subunit cleaves and gets inside goes to adenyl cyclase or something and activate it to convert atp to camp
2435341 camp is the salt imbalance stuff so that keeps sodium ions outside and inhibit the uptake
2435342 eventually chloride ions and stuff move out to balance unbalance
2435343 uhh good question well it has that type iii secretion something the one with spi 1 and spi2
2435344 spi1 injects the protein toxin probably into the cell and causes the actin filament to rearrange causing the ruffling of cell membrane which eventually covers the bacteria and bring it in
2435345 and some lysosomes come and try to acidify the endosome which causes the action of spi2 inject protein to the membrane of endosome which inhibits the fusion of lysosome and endosomes
2435346 well remember that pertussis causes whooping cough so its respiratory and its toxin mediated disease so
2435347 it needs to stay in respiratory system and it does so by adhering to the pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium and multiplying there
2435348 and the trachal cytotoxin can kill those ciliated cells too

2435357 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2435564 i still get patients who believe their lives are over once complications set it
2435565 the reality is that with the development of proper skills and mindset and the possession of monitoring equipment patients with diabetes can continue to live full lives even with severe complications many diabetics even insulin dependent live well into old age
2435566 pay attention to your body keep ahead of what your diabetes is doing for baby boomers this is no time for surprises consult with your doctor or your diabetes educator discuss exercise plans and any adjustment in medications with your doctor first
2435567 when you are 50 you may injure your body more easily than when you were 20
2435568 joints tissues and muscles may not be as flexible as they used to be so as you get older you need to take extra steps to protect yourself from injuries when you exercise
2435569 the outward signs of arousal in many women that seems to have little effect on a womans willingness or desire to have sex
2435570 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2435571 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2435572 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2435573 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
2435574 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2435575 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2435576 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2435577 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2435578 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2435579 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2435580 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2435581 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2435582 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2435583 children with simple febrile seizures had a risk of death similar to the background population whereas those with complex febrile seizures febrile seizures triggered by temperature below 39 c and febrile seizures occurring before 12 months of age had a two fold higher mortality lasting for about two years the excess mortality was at least partly due to pre existing neurological abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children
2435584 vestergaard and colleagues study again seems to refute for infants and children who have simple febrile seizures the idea of a shared cause between febrile seizures and sudden death the study suggests that there is a subset of children with febrile seizures notably those with complex features and underlying neurological abnormalities that may warrant closer attention and follow up
2435585 introduction of the clearview tb elisa is an important first step in making available much needed diagnostic tools to address the tb epidemic where the need is greatest we are working hard to build support for its widespread adoption
2435586 children with simple febrile seizures had a risk of death similar to the background population whereas those with complex febrile seizures febrile seizures triggered by temperature below 39 c and febrile seizures occurring before 12 months of age had a two fold higher mortality lasting for about two years the excess mortality was at least partly due to pre existing neurological abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children

2435588 these results are important because they show how a natural anti oxidant and anti inflammatory product like viaviente can help protect against one of our most serious health concerns

2435594 it was very uncommon to see so many people become avid runners into their 60s and 70s a generation ago
2435595 but its very common now to have middle aged people take up such a high endurance sport and run at a much later age
2435596 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
2435597 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
2435598 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
2435599 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
2435600 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
2435601 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease

2435640 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics

2435677 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2435678 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2435679 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2435680 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2435681 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2435773 vreau sa va spun de ce l am lasat pe jack sa mi foloseasca locuinta
2435774 acesta este un vis absurd pentru un baiat ca tine nu ai bani vii dintr o familie destramata si nu ai nici un fel de resurse ca sa faci o ferma de cai trebuie sa ai o gramada de bani mai intai trebuie sa cumperi pamantul apoi sa cumperi cativa cai cu care sa pornesti si mai tarziu va trebui sa platesti taxe uriase nu ai nici o sansa sa poti face asa ceva fa lucrarea din nou dar de data asta coboara cu picioarele pe pamant asa poate ca iti voi schimba nota
2435775 uite fiule trebuie sa iei singur o hotarare pentru ca asta este o decizie importanta
2435776 puteti pastra dumneavoastra nota 4 pentru ca eu imi pastrez visul
2435777 v am povestit toate acestea deoarece chiar acum va aflati in casa mea care masoara 1200 metri patrati si care se gaseste in mijlocul unei ferme de 100 de hectare inca mai am lucrarea aceea pe care am pus o in rama chiar deasupra semineului
2435778 partea cea mai grozava a povestii este ca acum doua veri profesoara mea de atunci a adus in tabara 30 de copii aici la mine
2435779 stii monty pot sa ti spun ceva acum cand erai elevul meu cred ca nu am facut altceva decat sa iti fur visurile in toti acesti ani am furat multe din visurile copiilor din fericire tu ai avut suficienta putere si nu te ai lasat influentat de nimeni
2435780 this time last year competition was rife with loss leading deals
2435781 i should make some legendary mix cds for the drive
2435782 ont compl tement lib r tskhinvali des forces militaires g orgiennes
2435783 nous sommes actuellement dans la phase intense de pr partion au d part nous attendons le feu vert de tbilissi pour partir aujourdhui demain ou apr s demain
2435784 tout le contingent d ploy en irak va partir les am ricains ont accept notre demande daide pour nous faire partir depuis la base delta
2435785 plus de 30 000 personnes ont franchi la fronti re avec la russie ces 36 derni res heures
2435786 jai vu des hommes tendus par terre ou autour de b timents en ruine ou dans des voitures
2435787 il est impossible de les compter et il y a peine un b timent en bon tat
2435788 each winner will get a personally signed copy and if they have a dog she will dedicate it to their dog as well not even remotely kidding
2435789 let it turn into something else let it turn let it turn
2435790 if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle
2435791 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
2435792 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2435793 i dont have an automotive wing ive got land for it but i dont have that link
2435794 rather than me try to generate something i dont have what do we have what is valued here
2435795 we have a lot of kids going to the world of work
2435796 where can they be gainfully employed and provide back to the community and earn a decent industry salary
2435797 the blacksmith is for stuff we cant get done outside
2435798 the cost to have a pool of spares for every component would be so great
2435799 they were just around so long they were life extended and then extended and then extended again
2435800 when i first got here that was full of whale oil
2435801 but had we gone to the girls home we would have acted
2435802 we cannot do anything until the court proceedings are completed
2435803 sometimes i do research but this is something im obsessed with these are my conversations that are written out
2435804 hi im david granger from esquire i really like what youve been writing lately do you want to write a pop culture column for us
2435805 we wanted some way of showing visually the various connections between all of the different things i was going to talk about
2435806 we work on similar things which is a real pleasure
2435807 it doesnt hurt that i have an amazing editor at home
2435808 i gave up an academic job with nothing to replace it
2435809 i dont know more to the point i dont care
2435810 though the road ahead may be challenging we are well positioned for that journey
2435811 the movement downward in oil over the last couple of weeks i view as helpful in the whole equation
2435812 we try to avoid it its usually a last resort item for us to do it midseason
2435813 if we were trying to recover the entire increased cost of fuel it would be closer to 20 per cent and we know that would be completely intolerable
2435814 if you raise your prices by 10 per cent you can almost calculate that youre going to have a 10 per cent drop in traffic
2435815 even when you go to the fake site it has their name and profile picture right on the site so you really believe it
2435816 its affecting what is arguably the most popular service among canadian web surfers to the best of my knowledge we havent really seen a facebook virus of this magnitude yet
2435817 i dont have any specific numbers but i do expect that it will spread rapidly given the popularity of the social networks
2435818 the implicit trust built into the social circle of friends and the willingness to share information with those in the circle will only the help the social engineering attacks to succeed
2435819 what this trojan does is it tries to steal a persons online gaming credentials
2435820 what they can do with these stolen gaming accounts is sell them online
2435821 it would steal your user name and password and send it back to whoever is sending this thing out
2435822 i think that people need to treat these social networking programs just like any other website dont give that implicit trust to everything that you see there youve really got to make sure that your computer is protected
2435823 so what hes saying is hey im the guy in charge here im the person who decides what to do not you is that right
2435824 i think what he was saying was if i become president then ill be the person that calls the shots
2435825 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2435826 the new sign and addition of the dolce brand on top of the hotel solidifies that we are in the home stretch of this major transformation
2435827 the housing slump and the recent turmoil in the financial markets are also distressing the condo market
2435828 the hope now is that the housing stimulus bill signed into law last week by the president will support a much needed turnaround in all sectors of the housing market including condos
2435829 we dont really think that plan was very well thought out
2435830 what used to be a pretty ordinary strip along the broadview danforth area has become more upscale more desirable because people started moving east
2435831 its still affordable for young families where other points of the street are not and with that comes the expectations of what families are looking for so then you see more restaurants pop up and more shops its really positive
2435832 there is a two headed dog in canada now and it needs places to drink so we decided to put them all over the city
2435833 the key to youth marketing is self discovery you dont want to bang someone over the head and say mtv2 is here
2435834 i think a lot of people who have dogs took them which is all part of the plan
2435835 my hope is that the people who manage starbucks will fill them up everyday
2435836 it takes them two days to process the e coli tests
2435837 they dont close the beach even if the storm grates have overflowed
2435838 but they wont have the results for another couple of days
2435839 we wont wait for the test results if we feel the water is unsafe
2435840 we do everything possible to err on the side of safety
2435841 there was a lot of debris it was an unusual circumstance our standard is built in such a way to incorporate a huge safety gap to account for these unusual circumstances
2435842 i would think the default position should be if theres a major rain event the beach would be posted red until you have test results
2435843 otherwise its like jumping out of an airplane and testing your parachute after youve left the plane
2435844 i have always maintained that the pools are community assets
2435845 this is not an education issue this is a community infrastructure issue
2435846 we need to know what the real numbers are and what the real potential is for the use of these pools
2435847 you can drink in public you can become intoxicated in public so long as you dont become disorderly
2435848 this year were coming down harder than we have in the past
2435849 i think theres a certain skepticism among the intelligentsia of the american sporting world that we torontonians can tailgate with the best of them so heres our opportunity to show them that were up to the challenge
2435850 if theres any way to issue a challenge to torontonians to show the world our tailgating skills i think we should do it lets raise the bar theyve got to represent too
2435851 a lot of these people just come up and sit around in the parking lot all day its not quite so much of a drunk fest as people like it to appear
2435852 theyre in a parking lot theyre already parked theyre not a problem its just part of the game day experience for these folks
2435853 for us its really about getting together with your friends and family
2435854 i think theyd be pleasantly surprised how well behaved a group it can be
2435855 we would be pleased if we could keep arpu flat
2435856 given these undertakings by bell mobility and telus i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2435857 there is room to accommodate new competitors without materially disrupting results
2435858 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2435859 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2435860 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2435861 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2435862 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2435863 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2435864 we feel great long term but we dont feel good about what the next six months might bring
2435865 while i dont want to make a trend out of a week and a half of august activity volume is very very slow
2435866 lenders want to lend but they want to lend much more prudently than they have in the past
2435867 based on just what weve seen happen in the last five or six weeks we dont think were past the fifth inning yet
2435868 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2435869 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar
2435870 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2435871 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2435872 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2435873 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industrywide failure of the auction rate securities market
2435874 filled the entire downtown area with the force of an entire rock band with beautiful bittersweet songs carried across with a stunning voice of lifting intensity power and flexibility
2435875 forged new territory in blending disparate sounds and influences together into a novel experience
2435876 pengar garanterar inga guld men f r att pengarna inte ska rinna ner i byr kratiska h l r det dags nu sl ihop sok och rf
2435877 skottland fr gade de nej waldner sa jag do you know pingpong
2435878 incompatible with a civic vision of a dense walkable urban extension of philadelphia to the rivers edge
2435879 the next step includes a conversation with the casino folks about their locations and design issues
2435880 they are very large footprint buildings with large parking structures
2435881 the waterfront vision is about connectivity water access and urban amenities and theres a tension there
2435882 we wont be commenting on it today we havent read through it
2435883 we are in receipt of the report and will review accordingly
2435884 we have legitimate concerns and this report lays some of it out
2435885 these challenges lead to a conclusion that casinos of this program type do not work on these sites and by extension would be better sited elsewhere
2435886 right now its comfortable for the dealers this is the first time all year its been that way
2435887 i would tell you that most margins today are in the 20 plus range
2435888 retail margins are as good as any retail margins weve seen since probably the third quarter of 2006 so very very strong
2435889 this is the first time in a while were seeing some profits in the end instead of breaking even
2435890 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive

2435909 i have been thinking of winning a medal but never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china
2435910 im very happy and i think i did a very good job
2435911 i was a little bit stressed and nervous in the competition thats why i didnt perform better
2435912 i only had 20 to 30 training days and i had injuries so i could be better
2435913 i had the special support from the chinese audience and therefore i dont think i was under great pressure
2435914 you boys know what makes this bird go up funding makes this bird go up
2435915 while its going to be hard to underperform the s amp p over the next year the massive amounts of debt and poor earnings per share will depress this stocks price
2435916 i would get in after the restructuring of the debt
2435917 i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2435918 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2435919 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2435920 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2435921 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2435922 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2435923 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2435924 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2435925 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2435926 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2435927 i think treasuries are the most overvalued asset in the world bar none
2435928 i still prefer an overvalued treasury to an overvalued stock
2435929 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2435930 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2435931 research also suggests that companies offer incoming ceos a greater amount of ex ante severance pay when requesting a confidentiality agreement
2435932 i heard squealing tires then boom saw the car flying off into the river
2435933 the first words out of his mouth were i was off to court to get a bench warrant lifted
2435934 when there is no more occupation there will be no need for these cells
2435935 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2435936 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2435937 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2435938 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2435939 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
2435940 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2435941 for a long time china dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2435942 however the actual event exceeded all my expectations this was an unprecedented and grand success
2435943 there will be a lot of people pulling for you
2435944 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot and i know youre excited about marching into the stadium representing our country so i guess all we have to say is go for it give it all youve got and god bless you
2435945 i have been to many games and many opening ceremonies
2435946 but this is by far by far the most sensational of them all bodes well for the rest of the games doesnt it mate
2435947 as the supreme court of new jersey has recognized for the executive branch to function effectively the chief executive must be free to receive consider and participate in candid communications
2435948 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2435949 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2435950 it was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2435951 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2435952 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2435953 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2435954 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2435955 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2435956 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2435957 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2435958 its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2435959 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2435960 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2435961 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2435962 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2435963 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2435964 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2435965 i got a couple of dogs and a granddaughter living with me now
2435966 i dont need no alligator i dont have a place for an alligator
2435967 power and force of his position in a private setting when it may have consequences
2435968 toute la brigade va rentrer dirak nous attendons maintenant les etats unis qui assurent notre transport
2435969 no one wants to see a closed historic theater on chestnut street
2435970 this is a building built in the new art deco style before construction had even started on the chrysler building
2435971 faith was full of hope and full of the possibilities for the future
2435972 for some it will come sooner for others it will take time
2435973 we like the womens softball and basketball and the gymnastics
2435974 we were desperate at that point so i put it all on my credit card i will never ever fly qantas again
2435975 i was livid they just didnt want us on the plane with the dogs it was pitiful
2435976 the fact that the nra feels compelled to plant spies in organizations like ours borders on paranoia
2435977 it reminds me of the days when general motors spied on ralph nader when he was trying to make automobiles safer
2435978 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2435979 that much of testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith need to be aired to the public and in the press
2435980 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2435981 with gods help and the prayers of many supporters we have and continue to endure it
2435982 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2435983 no alimony thats what im talking about its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2435984 ignored the publicity and grandstanding and focused on the facts
2435985 it was an ordinary case except for the two names on it
2435986 dealt with this as a couple splitting nothing more nothing less
2435987 not only is matos still capable of earning an income again after such a short marriage but the period during which the couple enjoyed an extremely high standard of living was inherently temporary
2435988 they would not have had personal assistants housekeeping managers groundskeepers and a residence provided them at no cost
2435989 it was apparent that he can rely on mark odonnell his partner to provide for him
2435990 he is underemployed because of his desire to return to school
2435991 during those four years hundreds of people who were privately experiencing the same pain reached out to me for support encouragement and guidance
2435992 in the future i will continue to help people who are victimized by those they once thought they could trust
2435993 anywhere but there how pathetic would that be going to my parents paper

2436008 weve been battling every night trying to win ballgames and hopefully we can keep playing that way there are a lot more games left
2436009 that was a shot in the arm for us as a club and me personally
2436010 it was against the same lineup virtually and a totally different outcome this time i started to get a little gassed near the end but the momentum of us swinging the bat and holding the lead replaced that i rode the adrenaline really
2436011 he was so sick in boston he looked very skinny very bad but he battled and did what he needed to do
2436012 i was trying not to do too much thinking about right field and not pulling the ball because rogers throws a lot of offspeed stuff
2436013 i knew i was getting a good pitch to hit
2436014 hes definitely earned that role everything hes done has been remarkable to this point
2436015 obviously im not sure my role in this game long term is as a closer but if i can help the team get a win and save the bullpen ill do whatever i can to help i know its hustons job long term no doubt about it
2436016 for a couple of weeks i just tried to pitch through it and kept my mouth shut
2436017 i was going 100 percent and all of a sudden i stopped thats a lot of torque

2436020 i wanted to go to the bank in barmouth and so i rang arriva trains which i have to do every time but no one answered
2436021 i decided to chance it and they let me on but on the way back the two carriages on the train were full
2436022 people were like sardines some even standing with babies in their arms
2436023 i got back ok but it was a bit traumatic as its quite scary on a scooter when you are passed by cars and bikes
2436024 i could understand it in winter but it is disgusting that there were only two carriages on the train as they do not seem to be catering to the holiday season at all
2436025 if a car had come around one of the corners mr wali would not have stood a chance whatsoever
2436026 it is so dangerous when you think this is a 60mph road and the mobility scooter goes 8mph maximum
2436027 we will look at ways of improving our journey care procedures in this context
2436028 it is unfortunate that we are unable to convey some scooter types and i would still urge any intending customers to contact us so that we can make the necessary assessment of their vehicle
2436029 every train we have is deployed to best use over the busy summer holiday period
2436030 the great irony of this is that much of the success of china in recent decades is a retrenchment of the government and to a certain extent political relaxation

2436075 dear teacher my wanda will not come to your school any more jake also now we move away to big city no more holler polack no more ask why funny name plenty of funny names in the big city yours truly jan petronski
2436076 true she had not enjoyed listening to peggy ask wanda how many dresses she had in her closet but she had said nothing she was a coward she had helped to make someone so unhappy that she had had to move away from town
2436077 nothing would ever seem good to her again because just when she was about to enjoy something like going for a hike with peggy to look for bayberries or sliding down barley bump right smack into the thought that she had made wanda petronski move away
2436078 you see it was the only workers i could get
2436079 challenge the university into having them take a stand about what the difference is between freedom of speech and hate speech fighting words and violent speech
2436080 theres a point where they dont have the right to say the things theyve been saying
2436081 to begin drawing a line and not keep covering everything with freedom of speech
2436082 you see it was the only workers i could get
2436083 we have to let the people know that they are at risk of being detained
2436084 anyone in the u s unlawfully should not be surprised if they are encountered or arrested to be placed in removal proceedings
2436085 its not a question of whether its right or wrong its the law
2436086 not only do we need more innovative products but we need to be able to tell a story around that product
2436087 in our april campaign we found a few products where customers totally didnt get it didnt care
2436088 we were pleased overall with the campaign but we want to make sure we do this better next year
2436089 we cant even keep it in stock its selling so well
2436090 we feel very strongly that there is nothing we can do that will be more successful and more impactful than the potential thats in this room and those products at our stores
2436091 it doesnt make sense to create a sustainable product you cant sell
2436092 they have set serious goals our challenge now is how can we help them meet their goals
2436093 in the end i was pleased with my score because it was so difficult out there
2436094 it was nice to get ahead of the game early i had a couple of chances on the back nine which would have been nice to convert on holes 11 and 13 but it was hard
2436095 i didnt drive it too bad on the back nine i didnt drive it as well on the front nine if i can hit a couple more fairways i think im fairly good
2436096 i played as bad as i have all year ball striking wise
2436097 i only made one birdie in two days and that was a two putt
2436098 my swing was horrible i didnt hit many fairways therefore i didnt hit many greens so i never had chances for birdie
2436099 its easy to time it on the range much harder on the course it didnt really fall into place at all
2436100 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2436101 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2436102 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2436103 i thought the offense moved the ball well but we shot ourselves in the foot a few times
2436104 if it had been 4th and 1 we were planning on going for it
2436105 it wasnt my call but we wanted to get the field goal on the board it was nice to finally get some tempo going
2436106 obviously theres going to be a lot to learn from

2436114 ketika seseorang merasa bahwa pembantunya tidak layak untuk makan satu meja bersama sama dirinya atau juga menganggap bahwa air dalam gelas bekas minumnya pantas untuk diminum pembantunya namun air bekas minum pembantunya tidak layak bahkan menjijikkan untuk diminum oleh dirinya maka orang seperti itu hatinya masih dihinggapi penyakit sombong
2436115 sebaliknya rendah hati itu adalah ketika kamu tunduk pada apa apa yang haq dan benar kamu ikuti itu sekalipun kamu mendengarnya dari seorang anak kecil maka terimalah nasihatnya bahkan sekalipun nasihat tentang kebenaran dan haq itu kamu dengar dari manusia yang paling bodoh kamu harus menyimak dan memperhatikannya

2436131 jumlah iklannya memang banyak sekali hanya saja hampir semuanya menawarkan posisi posisi menengah dan gaji yang minim ini menandakan bahwa lapangan kerja di bandung memang sempit sekali seharusnya kamu tidak memilih bekerja di bandung
2436132 pandanganmu kok sempit begitu buatku lapangan kerja sempit berarti lahan bisnis yang luas itulah alasan sebenarnya aku ingin tinggal di bandung sambil bekerja aku sekalian mempelajari potensi bisnis yang bisa dilakukan di bandung

2436145 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2436146 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2436147 hes had a good deal of success in this division
2436148 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york
2436149 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2436150 there are a lot of holes out here that are almost unplayable
2436151 it can get a little ridiculous i could definitely see where some criticism of the layout is coming from and ive been playing well
2436152 i dont think its real fair when you hit good shots and in some cases get penalized for them
2436153 i think there should be some tough holes but i dont think it should be i hit a perfect shot and make a double bogey no it shouldnt be like that
2436154 when i got here i called home and said this is the hardest course ive ever played
2436155 if i were to play it every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2436156 if you get it in the rough its more luck than skill from there
2436157 its a constant grind i saw the scoreboard before i played and if you didnt play youd be at the top by the end
2436158 i feel like im a really good spot you have to tell yourself that everyones playing the same course so it doesnt matter you just have to accept it i dont see the conditions really improving for scoring
2436159 if your game is not quite on the mark these sort of tournaments really find you out
2436160 the harder i tried the worse it got im obviously still having a hangover but im quite happy with the consequences of winning another open if this is it
2436161 we are not optimistic that he will pitch in 2008
2436162 but we really would like to have lews opinion on things because hes familiar with tom any time tom has had elbow problems hes pretty much seen lew i think lew is real familiar with his makeup and the kind of things that are going on i think after monday we can get that opinion we can really lay out a solid plan of care
2436163 i think right now flash is just trying to gather his information and figure out what is best for him
2436164 we have not talked about surgery nobody has even mentioned whether he is having surgery i think for him right now this probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and figure out where hes heading
2436165 i drove a little faster to get home and pack last night and had no problem getting up at 6 45
2436166 my wife kicked me out of bed this morning she didnt even drive me to the airport she got a car for me
2436167 we want him to go down and start on a regular basis
2436168 this time of the year and where were at its hard to get him work and develop in our bullpen
2436169 hes a starter and like i told him today he could be a good self evaluator and see how much hes improved hes going to be a starter in this league and its more than likely going to be with us
2436170 they would go to sleep and they wouldnt stand up again you would think probably tomorrow will be my day to die
2436171 i thought my parents were already dead i had to start another family i became happy there again
2436172 if you get a piece of chicken merry christmas to you
2436173 i said i want to be as fast as that guy i want to run for that country i want to wear that same uniform he knew it was impossible
2436174 there wasnt a guarantee you would get a chance to go to the free world
2436175 you will be watching me in the olympics in beijing
2436176 seven years before i was in a refugee camp i dont even have a word for it
2436177 we dont use that word frustrated weve been on the other side where we are always down looking up trying to win a game only just to stay a game back were on the opposite side of that were still in first place we have to keep looking forward and go out there tomorrow and get a win
2436178 its kind of like it wasnt meant for us to score
2436179 i wanted to make sure everything they said was in there was in there
2436180 i think it stacks up pretty well with other top running backs salaries we wanted to be in the top paid and this contract did that its a big burden off my chest
2436181 this took endless hours lots of nights until midnight 1 in the morning
2436182 brian gave me three areas that were important to him he told me when the deal was done wed either met or exceeded all three
2436183 we set a timeline with the team not a deadline
2436184 we didnt want him to play without having a contract
2436185 its a complicated deal everything ive ever seen is in this deal
2436186 i think this is the most complicated contract ive ever seen not just that ive ever done i read at least a synopsis of every contract done in the league and frequently try to look at the entire contract
2436187 we think of dawkins as a hall of fame caliber player i feel like im standing up here again right before the first preseason game of the season were talking about a hall of fame caliber player
2436188 thats what drove him its what has always driven him if you put the same things i said about dawkins a few years ago if you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team in who they are in their heart in their head that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2436189 hes going to come in he had another meeting yesterday with his doctor i think hell be in in the next little bit here
2436190 i guess my gripe with outside the lines would be that they didnt really try to get both sides
2436191 he said some football players told him they were prevented from talking to the people at judicial affairs i said who are those players he gave no names
2436192 i get sick and tired of people saying anonymous no names a source i mean he said i sent those unidentified players a text message i dont even know how to send a text message ive never had a text message come to me
2436193 that kind of stuff bothered me a little bit but i cant walk away from the fact we had some kids who did something wrong
2436194 the reasons i dismissed taylor and baker are reasons that the squad knows
2436195 theyre all proud to have been penn state football players
2436196 i really dont have an opinion about some of the things that happened they happened were human we make mistakes we learn from them and go on with our lives
2436197 i didnt actually see it when it played because i was driving back to school
2436198 but i took a peek at it on the internet i turned it off within like 2 minutes its no good for anybody to watch stuff like that
2436199 it wasnt just the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season just before the michigan game i was very close to her as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt as mentally focused on the football field
2436200 i learned a lot but now its over i dont think about it at all anymore i took a step back but im trying to get back to where i was
2436201 you see it was the only workers i could get
2436202 while many may have been legitimately lost it seems probable that quite a few are either stolen or reported stolen in order to sell them
2436203 there appears to be a healthy market for both buying and renting laser visas on the border
2436204 you see it was the only workers i could get
2436205 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2436206 the true amount of economic damages suffered by plaintiffs and the statistical likelihood of liability in class action discrimination cases
2436207 because of her knowledge of law and of zoning and her ability to really make things happen people had tremendous respect for her opinion on things
2436208 no one has any idea of how much judith has done in her quiet behind the scenes way
2436209 its a great day for all the people of philadelphia
2436210 zoning is at the heart of every civic organization and this was an attack
2436211 judith is the scourge of the zoning board the woman on the other side of the table who gives them nothing but grief
2436212 but the neighborhood groups were clamoring for someone on the board who knew about you know zoning and design and planning and didnt curtsy whenever a developer passed by and thats judith
2436213 you come here and you realize that philadelphia is such a great place to live you can walk in center city from river to river and see such an array of architectural treasures as there is literally nowhere else in the world
2436214 my strategy was to sit next to the prettiest girl and offer to tutor her but it didnt work because she was smarter than i was
2436215 so we became friends i went to israel for a year and when i came back we started to date
2436216 i called judith asking if she knew anyone willing to sublet an apartment for a few months
2436217 she surprised me by responding why dont you just come live with us
2436218 life with judith eden could be intimidating at first youd walk into the living room where she was sitting amidst piles of newspapers and magazines and then shed just start to interrogate you she wanted to know about everything and she was whip smart and very opinionated
2436219 but once youd proven your mettle with her she showered you with this fierce loyal love that could only be called maternal at the edens encouragement i kept a key to their front door for years afterward like so many others i was part of the extended family
2436220 she was such an inspiration to all of us women
2436221 because she was such a feminist but she loved to dress she always had these funky elegant glasses was always well put together was very elegant but quirky with a sense of humor she had the driest sense of humor
2436222 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2436223 god called them home and he called them at a good time
2436224 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2436225 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2436226 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2436227 if you were only going to buy one membership at a paysite i would definitely recommend this one
2436228 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2436229 thats the difference from college the coverages were messing me up i still have a whole lot of work to do
2436230 thats usually what i try to do go out and throw strikes they were swinging early and that helped me out

2436232 i was 29 and it was my first big story for the new york times so i drove down to the waterfront in my car and to get to the gate i had to just climb over masses of bodies accumulated there
2436233 the car just had to drive over these dead bodies and the scene on the river front as i waited for the launch was of a group of smoking chattering japanese officers overseeing the massacring of a battalion of chinese captured troops
2436234 they were marching about in groups of about 15 machine gunning them

2436244 we have no military but power our calm will prevail
2436245 i was only holding a canadian flag i planned to use that as a decoy but they said id broken the rules and would have to leave the whole thing was pretty ridiculous

2436295 that no real growth into higher consciousness can occur unless working with the emotions becomes a central part of inner work working with emotion as well as feeling in general can become a most vital and even primary path to self realization enabling us to release the inner forces that keep us blocked and from our full potential

2436300 what does having the right to the pursuit of happiness mean when genocide starvation and environmental breakdown are facts of life all over the planet
2436301 so i raked i mowed i weeded i t ried to find ultimate meaning with my partner but nothing seemed to appease this inner restlessness one afternoon i drove to boston to hear spiritual teacher andrew cohen speak the haunted restless part of myself rejoice at what was revealed a higher purpose and untold possibility and back at the farm i became even more unsettled one morning i was standing in the kitchen next to the maple syrup cans and had a vision a funnel of pure energy was pulling me headlong into it i looked out at the trees nothing could be more beautiful than our new farm but no matter how pristine was my own small corner of paradise no matter how wonderful were the personal life conditions i created for myself the world was in desperate shape and those larger life conditions seemed to be generating an undeniable calling a higher purpose that was coming from way beyond all my green ideals from way beyond my relationship from way beyond the maple trees and from way beyond the mountains no matter how beautiful this place was and it sure was beautiful it simply wasnt enough having turned forty my midlife crisis took the form of an inner imperative i had to follow this calling for the sake of life itself
2436302 the objective psyche is common to everyone and it has a better sense of the selfs ideal than the ego or conscious self does it thus directs the self via archetypes dreams and intuition and drives the person to make mistakes on purpose in this way it moves the psyche toward individuation or self actualization

2436309 scientists have found that the seas have already absorbed about half of all the carbon dioxide emitted by humanity since the start of the industrial revolution a staggering 500 billion tons of it this has so far helped slow global warming which would have accelerated even faster if all this pollution had stayed in the atmosphere already causing catastrophe but at an increasingly severe cost the gas dissolves in the oceans to make dilute carbonic acid which is increasingly souring the naturally alkali seawater this in turn mops up calcium carbonate a substance normally plentiful in the seas which corals use to build their reefs and marine creatures use to make the protective shells they need to survive these include many of the plankton that form the base of the food chain on which all fish and other marine animals depend as the waters are growing more acid this process is decreasing with incalculable consequences for the life of the seas and for the fisheries on which a billion of the worlds people depend for protein every single species that uses calcium in this way that has so far been studied has been found to be affected and the seas are most acid near the surface where most of their life is concentrated

2436314 social ecology versus deep ecology a challenge for the ecology movement
2436315 deep ecology is so much of a black hole of half digested ill formed and half baked ideas
2436316 it was out of this kind of crude eco brutalism that hitler in the name of
2436317 social ecology is neither deep tall fat nor thick it is social it does not fall back on incantations sutras flow diagrams or spiritual vagaries it is avowedly rational it does not try to regale metaphorical forms of spiritual mechanism and crude biologism with taoist buddhist christian or shamanistic eco la la it is a coherent form of naturalism that looks to evolution and the biosphere not to deities in the sky or under the earth for quasi religious and supernaturalistic explanations of natural and social phenomena
2436318 politics as a fairly exclusive generally professional ized system of power interactions in which specialist whom we call
2436319 a rich political culture daily public discussion in squares parks street corners educational institutions open lectures clubs and the like
2436320 it remains to emphasize that such free communities did not always or necessarily dissolve into self contained mutually exclusive and parochial units
2436321 the ability to provide for the needs of the worlds current population without damaging the ability of future generations to provide for themselves
2436322 without generating negative environmental effects without causing waste products to accumulate as pollution and without compromising the wellbeing of workers or communities
2436323 global warming is not the only topic on which the public is moving beyond denial this is a great time for ideas big enough to match the scale of the problems
2436324 narcissists spend their lives trying to get people to mirror back approval they have thousands of tentacles thousands of sensors and all these sensors are constantly working to pick up signs of approval
2436325 how will you do that you dont know how to play the piano

2436328 at midlife we men are invited to stop the charade visit our wounds not only the physical ones but also the psychological and spiritual ones learn from them our wounds are the places were the self is open to the world
2436329 if current predictions of population growth prove accurate and patterns of human activity on the planet remain unchanged science and technology may not be able to prevent either irreversible degradation of the environment or continued poverty for much of the world greater attention in the developed countries to conservation recycling substitution and efficient use of energy and a concerted program to start mitigating further buildup of green house gases will help to ease the threat to the global environment the future of our planet is in the balance sustainable development can be achieved but only if irreversible degradation of the environment can be halted in time
2436330 while the agenda for action in arenas we the people define is long complicated and still unfolding a good place to begin is to take away corporate personhood
2436331 tell them that all of the things they are so afraid to lose all the reasons why the message of this book is difficult to accept will wash away with love turn to love and those other problems will fall away they will move into the solution that cant be explained the future that cant be seen the love that cant be felt

2436333 most people think of anarchy as all hell breaking loose but what anarchy really means is a society without hierarchies of power in fact power hierarchies themselves have proven to be exceptionally violent over the long course of history the state is simply the institutionalization of all hell breaking loose around a particular arrangement of power
2436334 the promise of anarchism is that we might rise to the challenge of being transparent about our uses of power intentional about sharing power in a more just way and thoughtful about the corresponding organization of systems and structures
2436335 thus what we normally call zen may be described as an anarchism of the mind and what we normally call anarchism maybe understood as a zen of social relations

2436348 we as students and followers of the honorable elijah muhammad are calling on all able bodied black men to set aside a day october 16 1995 for an historic march on washington to declare to the government of america and the world that we are ready to take our place as the head of our families and our communities and that we as black men are ready to shoulder the responsibility of being the maintainers of our women and children and the builders of our communities there is enough unused and undeveloped talent in the black male to build an entirely new world the almighty allah god has declared that the time is ripe and that we must get up from our assigned place at the foot of the rulers of this world and show forth the wisdom and power of allah god in doing something for ourselves

2436359 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2436360 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2436361 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2436362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2436363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2436364 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2436365 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2436366 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2436370 the cross is not a sign of the churchs quiet suffering submission to the powers that be but rather the churchs revolutionary participation in the victory of christ over those powers
2436371 the cross is not a symbol for general human suffering and oppression
2436372 the overriding political task of the church is to be the community of the cross
2436373 the federal government and the opposition are both well aware of the pressures that are on manufacturing now
2436374 a future government is committed to running a review of industry policy in 2008 and in our view thats going to be the appropriate place to take up these issues with a future government
2436375 reduction on tariffs is putting pressure on competition because australia is currently already one of the most open car markets in the world and future reductions will put more pressure on local manufacturing
2436376 the howard government has put in place 7 3 billion dollars worth of assistance to the automobile industry in australia and toyota has been a major beneficiary of that
2436377 as part of that process there is a review planned for next year and that review will look at all aspects of the assistance measures
2436378 i have one single focus tonight and it is what is my plan for australias future and what is mr howards
2436379 here we are a week into this campaign and i really dont have any idea where mr howard stands by way of his alternative policies
2436380 were working with the company in order to look at what we can do for them in their best interests in the short term and the long term

2436382 we received the bodies of 10 people all of them men
2436383 brand new building cost 7 million has been in the planning and development for years and years but the state government has done absolutely nothing to prepare for its opening by recruiting the psychiatric nurses that are needed
2436384 you cant open a facility until youve got enough nurses for it to be operated safety
2436385 itll be opened as soon as we are able to recruit enough nurses to do that
2436386 this might seem like a trivial matter but what it means is that when allegations of assault and improper behaviour are made against individual police officers its very difficult to identify them precisely because theyre not wearing the badges
2436387 there is a requirement that police do wear that type of identification and no order was given to the contrary today that i would think of
2436388 if youve got evidence that we need to look at or information im certain that our professional standards command will be happy to take that
2436389 you can be certain that wed be following it up on the basis that we follow every one of those matters up
2436390 i started moving away from the area and was pretty quickly thrown to the floor by police and had a knee put into my head and pushed into the concrete and put in handcuffs and sort of dragged away along the ground from the scene
2436391 a number of other people who were quite distressed about the whole thing coming to my aid were also arrested by police
2436392 why am i acquiring all this information what good is it doing me

2436396 we went out to where she was located about five kilometres from the lodge and brought her back to the lodge and got a medivac helicopter out from darwin that collected her and took her back for observation and some treatment
2436397 the lodge has been conducting guided walking safaris for about 18 years and this is the first incident of its kind but national parks are home to all kinds of wild animals including buffalo and thats what is part of the allure and why visitors come here
2436398 this is something that i really wouldnt want to comment on
2436399 i have decided to be a trappist monk on this issue
2436400 i think the important thing though on the issue of character is owning up to your mistakes when you make them

2436408 very little academic material exists on ict service management best practice
2436409 research site was a large service unit of ict in a provincial government in south africa during 2002 3
2436410 we can rather safely conclude that the number of problems logged would be a good reflection of objective service levels
2436411 did you observe the expected roi base 20 european firms no 50 dont know 30 yes 20
2436412 some helpdesks can way outperform a site that has adopted the best practices of itil
2436413 best practice does not mean superior performance it is beginning to sound that itil is the only way to go it isnt it is only one way to go
2436414 there is nothing else quite like itil it is not a methodology per se it is just advice and guidance itil is not based on scientific theory it is documented best practice itil is widely used because it is commonsense but it is not a bible that should be followed blindly
2436415 if it were all limited to research with ironclad causality determined the amount of scientific research published would drop dramatically furthermore pure deduction really only comes into play in math philosophy and other such deterministic endeavors the softer the science the more controversial the deductive reasoning to the point where in fields like the social sciences causality is almost impossible to rigorously prove
2436416 i have just completed a thorough statistical examination of the life of president bush for fifty eight years close to 21 000 observations he did not die once i can hence pronounce him as immortal with a high degree of statistical significance
2436417 not sure why you think i am confusing correlation with induction
2436418 what started this all was your implication that inductive reasoning is somehow suspect
2436419 i have determined in my recent conversations with real scientists
2436420 surely if itpis efforts are so impoverished and misguided and doing credible research is so simple and straightforward there must be solid examples somewhere that one of you can point to
2436421 lysenko was a self promoting peasant who it was said solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals lysenkos methods never faced a rigorous test
2436422 lysenko was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents he used questionnaires from farmers to prove that his methods increased crop yields and thus avoided any direct tests
2436423 lysenko and his theories dominated russian biology the result was famines that killed millions and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics which was finally banned there was never any basis for lysenkos ideas yet he controlled soviet research for thirty years lysenkoism ended in the 1960s but russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era

2436425 we started with interviews of 11 organizations recognized for their data center operational excellence
2436426 interview data collection and analysis proceeded iteratively with early interviews being more open ended and later interviews being directed by five emerging themes of common practice
2436427 we also asked about key measures they used to gauge success in these areas
2436428 which of the following best describes your definition of change success rate

2436434 while cci welcomes mr barnetts preparedness to allow shops to open later on weeknights the same standards must also apply on sundays and for all retailers so they can better meet the needs of their customers
2436435 these types of changes will simply increase the dominance of major national retailers at the expense of independent operators and lead to reduced competition store closures and job losses
2436436 we acknowledge that he does not support wholesale deregulation and that if there is to be any change which is not our position it will be done gradually and only after extensive reference to all affected parties

2436452 following investigations made by our gas and electricity engineers we can confirm that an underground electrical cable fault has occurred causing the fire under the pavement
2436453 we can also confirm that 35 customers have been in affected in total from approximately 3 20pm this afternoon across st helens street cocker lane and the bitter end brewery areas of kirkgate our electricity engineers have remained on site and are digging down in the area to locate the source of the fault and start carrying out repairs
2436454 we got called to kirkgate to reports of a fire under the pavement there were signs that there had been a fire but there was no significant smell of gas
2436455 as a precaution the road was closed off and we evacuated an adjacent property
2436456 we are advising women to take sensible precautions such as avoiding walking alone at night where possible and sticking to well lit and well used areas
2436457 it is important to remember that this is the only incident of this nature to be reported to police and that it is an isolated incident unusual for the area
2436458 these kind of attacks are very rare and we have a whole team involved to track down the man who did this
2436459 we are asking people to be aware of what has happened and take extra care if you are going out then go with a group for safety
2436460 we are following a number of lines of enquiry and will be sifting through all the information which we gathered on thursday to help us
2436461 we would like to take this opportunity to thank members of the public for their cooperation so far

2436480 while their original followers who probably have less opportunities of catching the bands gigs these days most likely just hear the more recent hits from the sophomore album
2436481 we received so many text messages and email asking not only how to join the auditions but also how to watch and witness
2436482 we think of this as not losing a vocalist or a songwriter but gaining four
2436483 we have three singer songwriters now in rivermaya we are now looking for a fourth brother for the rivermaya family
2436484 the heart and soul of the band is all the people who have continued to support the band these last 14 years

2436499 it was a great venue for me to play with my bands kjwan and happy meals the equipment was impressive and the place had a unique vibe not present in many venues i miss it
2436500 6ug had pretty good equipment i liked going and having gigs there without wondering if the amps will work or not it felt like the musicians were taken cared of because truthfully most rock clubs tend not to care about sound quality not at 6ug the bands sound was always top priority
2436501 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders
2436502 i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain
2436503 this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009

2436510 were just trying to get accurate scores out this year as accurate as possible as soon as possible
2436511 its very important that the scores that are reported are accurate so if we have to wait a few more weeks to have accurate scores i think that that would be an appropriate thing to do
2436512 theyve had scoring delays theyve had mess ups in delivering from the vendors and its just one more problem thats been associated with the states scoring system
2436513 since this is pending litigation we are unable to comment
2436514 the secret archives is a small safe that was kept within the locked archives of the diocese a larger room
2436515 but the good news is while were seeing less new home construction were still seeing 150 new houses which is a pretty good number
2436516 we expect to do at least what we did last year
2436517 things havent come to a complete halt but its not what we were used to
2436518 we have certainly had to adjust thats a thing in business that you sometimes have to deal with
2436519 of course there has been lots and lots of bad news about the housing industry on the national level but all real estate markets are local and i think were much better off than most
2436520 like any other business we deal in supply and demand
2436521 the demand increased so the supply increased but it just kept going the peak we had was an anomaly it went far beyond where the trend lines should have taken us
2436522 we still have growth but its a more moderate rate of growth
2436523 there are a lot of cities our size and bigger that would love to have 150 new homes a year
2436524 there arent a lot of new houses but the new houses were adding are pretty nice
2436525 ive been a student of e gaming photographic images design for almost 20 years now
2436526 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director connolly stittgen promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more e gaming photographic images design hours but this also means more money for all of us
2436527 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
2436528 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our e gaming photographic images design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
2436529 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
2436530 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each e gaming photographic images design and apply them to our own work
2436531 because as interest and corporate demand for e gaming photographic images art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
2436532 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this e gaming photographic images industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
2436533 the key to working on good e gaming photographic images design pieces is patience and rote talent
2436534 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my e gaming photographic images art and drawing skills
2436535 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
2436536 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
2436537 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
2436538 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
2436539 to be honest i didnt even have to invite him to come back
2436540 he told me recently in hockenheim that he wished to race again because loved the town and the relaxed atmosphere he found here
2436541 it was almost everything set to kubica attend the race in 2007 but a last minute commitment prevented him from coming
2436542 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2436543 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2436544 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2436545 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2436546 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2436547 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good

2436552 i went to fill up at the local service station this weekend while i
2436553 today i found out that an old friend had to put his beloved pet to sleep it must be a horrible day for him but let me give you the backround story
2436554 will regulate the whole chain of production and distribution of food
2436555 the impact in the first case that we can see is that the state will decide what needs to be eaten when and where
2436556 we dont have a constitution or law and the president does what he wants
2436557 were faced with a dictatorship that carried out a coup detat on the constitution
2436558 in a sense achieving some of the things that he wanted to get in a referendum last year that was voted down
2436559 neither venezuelas citizens nor the national assembly were afforded the opportunity to participate in a debate on these changes
2436560 former presidential candidate john edwards who won nationwide praise and sympathy as he campaigned side by side with his cancer stricken wife elizabeth admitted in shame friday he had had an affair with a woman who produced videos as he prepared to launch his campaign
2436561 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2436562 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2436563 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2436564 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2436565 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2436566 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2436567 stating that its reporters had accosted edwards in a los angeles hotel where he had met with hunter after her childs birth
2436568 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2436569 cate jack and emma claire another son wade died at 16 in a 1996 car accident
2436570 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2436571 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2436572 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2436573 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues
2436574 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2436575 china didnt just walk onto the world stage it soared over it
2436576 capped by the spellbinding sight of a skywalking torchbearing gymnast floating around the stadiums top rim before sending a torrent of fire upward to light the olympic flame
2436577 china investing 40 billion to build olympic infrastructure reeling from the sichuan earthquake struggling right through friday to diminish the stubborn smog that enveloped the stadium known as the birds nest
2436578 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2436579 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2436580 featuring everything from the great wall to opera puppets to astronauts and highlighting achievements in art music and science
2436581 there were no references to chairman mao and the class struggle nor to the more recent conflicts and controversies
2436582 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2436583 auspicious in a country where eight is the luckiest number terms of service
2436584 the one that really concerned me was t j williams because that was a non football thing
2436585 we got word that he is alert he is conscious and he is fine
2436586 they will probably keep him overnight for observation they think he may have just had an asthma attack but that certainly puts the practice in perspective when you have something like that happen when you have a young man unconscious like that for a little while as a coach there is nothing that prepares you for that kind of situation
2436587 the oklahoma drill lets you know camp is in full effect
2436588 starting that lets you know its time to step up and play ball
2436589 i like the competitiveness thats good for our wide receivers they need to step up and play better than what they have been for us and to see them go out and compete against those defensive backs like that is only going to make them better theres nothing wrong with the pushing and shoving as long as they shake hands afterwards which they did they know they are competing hard but they know they are one team

2436596 the players know how to win and i hope to take them deeper in the ncaa tournament
2436597 we got a late start in recruiting but i think we got a good class well know shortly
2436598 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2436599 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2436600 more often dealt with by more formal methods like reprimands final warnings and prosecution
2436601 when you have a commercial or an advertisement that has to go through the management gauntlet for approval you end up with something that is indistinct and boring and utterly forgettable its a complete waste of time and money
2436602 be fewer things to fewer people as long as you can
2436603 when it works its been slower than the bell on the last day of school
2436604 our heart rate was so high im seriously happy it is over and i hold gold
2436605 i feel really bad for du li i do and id like to give these flowers to her because she can shoot way better than she did today
2436606 sorry the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2436607 i had a hard time handling my own pressure its obvious to see theres a lot of pressure on du everywhere every day in training all around her
2436608 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2436609 it happened to me once too you just want to take a break and chat
2436610 so her dad and i just talked to her for a minute
2436611 its great to have him i knew id do good even if he couldnt be here and hed do great if i wasnt here the fact were here together is awesome we work as a team its one of the best in the world
2436612 our speed in the last practice session before qualifying gave us a lot of hope
2436613 because we had tried a lot of different things in yesterdays test session that didnt quite work out today we had a completely different setup on the car and were able to fine tune one steady state setup the guys did a fantastic job because it just got better and better
2436614 we were second overall and fastest in our class in the last practice session
2436615 and in qualifying we just missed a little bit of grip getting into the apex im not too disappointed though because in terms of setup i feel weve got a better race car than a qualifying car we proved that the consistency and the lap time are there all the time with the michelin tires and i think weve got a setup that will work very well for a long period and its a four hour race
2436616 the industry having excelled in manufacturing is now realising the need to have other skills that we did not have as customers are asking us to do other things than contract manufacturing
2436617 we realise we needed these skills to be internationally competitive one of which is marketing
2436618 but the demands being made by customers are putting a lot of pressure on our business unit to be able to give them much than a product theyre looking at us sourcing fabric at us developing and designing the product
2436619 it is those who can give this entire package who are now emerging as successful suppliers to some of the better brands
2436620 there is a destination that the customer has in mind that a country is eligible for concessionary duty
2436621 when that the concession is not there the incentive to come to sri lanka is that much less
2436622 so you have to make additional efforts to reach your customer and you really need to have competencies to do that the cim programme helps you build those competencies which are critical at this point in time
2436623 helped me be a smarter businessman in negotiating with the customer
2436624 we qualified a tenth off the second penske porsche and have two well balanced cars for the race
2436625 it is a four hour race and you concentrate on setting up a car that works equally well in the diversity of high and low speed corners that road america is known for we have had good race cars at this track and have finished on the podium in three of our last five races here
2436626 unlike some tracks that feel like they were created in a laboratory this is a very organic track it is challenging track for aero balance where the car needs to be well balanced in all situations
2436627 it is known as a horsepower circuit because of the long straights
2436628 but it is also important to have mechanical balance because of the slow corners that you need to come off of as smoothly and quickly as possible because of the impact on your top end speed braking efficiency is also critical since you need to carry your speed as long as you can on the straights
2436629 this is a circuit that lets the car do what it wants to
2436630 it gives you a feeling of freedom as a driver they really did it right in the fifties when they were building this track they went out in the woods no slide rules no architects they built the track to the land and gave it a great natural flow i watched a lot of races here when my dad was racing and always look forward to coming back each year

2436633 when an allegation is unsubstantiated the teachers identity is not a matter of legitimate public concern disclosure of the identities of teachers who are the subject of unsubstantiated allegations serves no interest other than gossip and sensation
2436634 it is important to bear in mind that unsubstantiated does not mean untrue
2436635 the organisation of the event has been great and everyone has worked so hard and all of the performances have been brilliant
2436636 the mela is about bringing all the cultures and communities together and there was a great feeling that everyone was part of the whole event a real sense of togetherness
2436637 we have been very lucky with the weather this year as it has not rained like it did last year but unfortunately the car crash on the m62 affected the turnout on sunday
2436638 perhaps then we could all eventually raise a toast to life
2436639 twenty thousand viewers may not seem like a lot and we want to get up to 50 000
2436640 but the viewers tend to be very passionate and curious about the content if it is intelligent and attractive then the audience keeps coming back because of their interest in the subject they want more
2436641 there are probably a dozen companies doing this now some really big like broadband enterprise and most of the big traditional and cable networks are beginning to repurpose their existing content and placing it online but theres room for us
2436642 five years from now you wont be able to tell the difference between tv programming and online video
2436643 they have a good idea because its an easy to consume model and their content is aimed at a niche audience
2436644 theyre interested in high quality content they take it seriously and want to do it right and theyre good guys its my hobby so ive really enjoyed doing it
2436645 its like when the transition occurred from radio to tv
2436646 theyre mostly men so maybe it could be about male hygiene and all that
2436647 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2436648 magazines have to be sensitive to perceptions that light skinned african americans are more acceptable

2436653 in the evening standard of 6 august we stated that the duke of edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2436654 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2436655 we welcome this decision we made two complaints about accuracy because it was not true and about a breach of privacy we are glad both were upheld so swiftly this is a very significant ruling
2436656 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he gave in 2002

2436661 with exposure to an environment that has poor quality air pollutants may trigger symptoms of asthma in a dose dependent manner
2436662 with the high minute ventilation amount of air breathed in one minute seen during exercise the effects of exposure to these pollutants are more noticeable in athletes than in non athletes and likely more evident in people with asthma than in those without asthma
2436663 however a significant percentage of the pollution about 35pct at the olympic stadium can be attributed to sources outside beijing controlling only local sources of pollution may not be sufficient to achieve the air quality goal set for the beijing games

2436707 the concept of a beach convent is something that is appreciated by vacationers and the nuns themselves
2436708 there is a certain inevitability about where were going there is less and less non gm soya being planted in the world as long as availability reduces the premium will increase and it will become harder and harder for the supply chain to accept that price
2436709 the idea that this little problem in the uk is going to stimulate planting is just nuts the situation is getting more and more crucial
2436710 in the coming years retailers will be forced to sell chicken which has been fed on gm soya
2436711 but diverting gm free feed to all poultry will make it difficult and expensive for organic and specialist producers with gm free policies to continue
2436712 if imports were highly constrained or expected to become so the pressure to maintain supplies would increase the risk that feed coming to the uk might inadvertently or even deliberately be wrongly labelled as non gm when in fact either approved or non approved gm material is present
2436713 these include potential impacts on the integrity of the regulatory system and on livestock production including the risk that additional costs will be imposed on producers that will ultimately impact upon the price of food
2436714 the government will continue to lobby the eu to improve the regulatory regime for gm products including speeding up decisions on the import of gm feedstocks without prejudicing safety
2436715 the use of non gm feed is a well established practice for poultry suppliers to the main retailers and all expectations are this trend will continue retailers are well aware of the cost pressures suppliers are under and will reward them accordingly
2436716 although there have been decreasing amounts of certified non gm soya produced there are still more than enough volumes to satisfy the uk poultry industrys needs the real issue is about cost impact not availability
2436717 smart feed buyers will place contracts at the start of the growing season to procure their non gm feed supplies this virtually guarantees supply for the year ahead there is a reluctance to do this but all the major suppliers of feed foresee adequate supply to meet uk demand of non gm soya
2436718 we are in constant dialogue with our suppliers concerning the cost of production as well as any increased costs that we have to absorb as a retailer we will continue to take into account market pricing when negotiating with our suppliers on cost going forward
2436719 it has always been the intention to move gradually towards non gm feed in other livestock sectors however this is a gradual and slow process the slow pace of this conversion does not mean that it would be acceptable for the only sector with an exclusively non gm position to move backwards
2436720 although there is always a need to be mindful of the influence of external events and circumstances our customers needs are our priority and there are no plans to move from this position
2436721 asda has no problems accessing gm free soya and we dont anticipate any issues with regard to poultry feed with regard to the wider issue of gm we are open minded about gm technology but until the benefits to the end consumer are clearly demonstrated be that more food security through better use of land improvements in health or lowering the cost of living we are not going to take the lead
2436722 it is not for supermarkets to make that case but for expert scientists and government as always the products we sell will reflect the views of our customers

2436903 the cci believes that its time for the states political leaders to deliver to west australian consumers
2436904 the ccis own research shows that western australians want extended trading hours and it shows that they will deliver lower prices
2436905 in 2008 there is no need for us to be told where and when we can shop
2436906 the issue of retail trading hours has been for many years a contentious issue in western australia
2436907 the reality is though there have been various steps of deregulation over the last 15 to 20 years
2436908 i am very conscious of respecting and honouring that vote
2436909 however as a member of parliament i am very conscious of the widely divergent views on our trading hours
2436910 if the liberal party wins and we are in government then i would sit down in a co operative and constructive way with major interest groups that support the issue
2436911 when you deregulate whatever industry it might be you should do it carefully and you should do it in stages and everyone should know of changes well in advance

2436918 many types of criticisms leveled at the judiciary cross the line to become harmful and irresponsible attacks these potentially devastating attacks and unjust criticism can threaten the independence of the judiciary
2436919 first the criticism will prevent judges from remaining insulated from the personal and political consequences of making an unpopular decision thus placing judicial independence at risk second unjust criticism of the judiciary will erode the publics trust and confidence in the judiciary as an institution
2436920 i agree with the majority that macasaet failed to substantiate his story however i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that this suffices to hold macasaet guilty of contempt of court
2436921 i respectfully reiterate my dissent in the in re emil jurado case i vote to dismiss the contempt charge
2436922 macasaet was reduced to a passive participant unable to subject the testimonies of adverse witnesses to rigorous probing under cross examination as matters stand macasaet will be subjected to punitive sanctions based on evidence he had no opportunity to scrutinize
2436923 before a journalist can be punished in a criminal contempt case as in this case there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt that his publication tends to obstruct administration of justice and the degree of imminence of the obstruction actually happening extremely high
2436924 fails to meet the applicable standard in contempt by publication proceedings
2436925 a free press is not to be preferred to an independent judiciary nor an independent judiciary to a free press neither has primacy over the other both are indispensable to a free society
2436926 disproportionately informing the public about specific court processes or by spreading unsubstantiated allegations about corruption and other forms of judicial misconduct the press dramatically undermines the publics faith in the courts and threatens the very foundation of our democratic government
2436927 people may lose faith in the executive or the president they may lose faith in congress the congressmen and the senators but as long as they have faith unshaken and complete in the last bulwark of democracy which is the supreme court then our democracy will survive
2436928 we have no problems with legitimate criticisms pointing out flaws in our decisions
2436929 unfortunately the published articles of respondent macasaet are not of this genre on the contrary he has crossed the line as his are baseless scurrilous attacks which demonstrate nothing but abuse of press freedom
2436930 illegitimate and uninformed criticisms against the courts and judges those which cross the line and attempt to subvert the judicial process must be avoided
2436931 freedom however has not guaranteed quality journalism the press has been vulnerable to a host of legitimate criticisms such as incompetence commercialism and even corruption
2436932 reeked of urban legend as it generated more questions than answers
2436933 his aim as he admits was to go on a fishing expedition to see if someone would confirm or deny his now clearly baseless accusations
2436934 it is precisely because of his failure to abide by the tenets of responsible journalism that we accept the findings of the investigating committee in holding respondent macasaet guilty of indirect contempt of court
2436935 not absolute for if left unbridled they have the tendency to be abused and can translate to licenses which could lead to disorder and anarchy
2436936 the committee finds that neither macasaets columns in malaya nor ms vitugs story in newsbreak about the pay off of php 10 million to justice consuelo ynares santiago for rendering a resolution favorable to henry go in his petition against the sandiganbayan according to macasaet or a decision favoring barque against manotok in a big land case according to ms vitug have a leg to stand on
2436937 the committee observed that macasaets story about the bribery and of cecilias role in supposedly discovering it is full of holes inconsistencies and contradictions indicating that he did not exercise due diligence patience and care in checking the veracity of the information fed to him before giving it publicity in his columns nor was he bothered by the damage that his columns would inflict on the reputation of a member of the highest court and on the court itself

2436959 we did not feel sorry for the development of a similar scenario whilst the separatists did not leave other way for us everybody must know that georgia will not tolerate bombarding of its civil citizens and the georgian government has an opportunity to answer adequately to their action and the state will do its best for protection of its citizens
2436960 currently russia is implementing large scale military aggression against us and we together with the international community must halt the fighting now decisive moment came either we will set up deserving state or all existing problems will increase ten times our state has forces and resources to prevent obstacles

2437087 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2437088 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2437089 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2437090 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway and im not sure politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2437091 how do i install a vista networking tips sharing on a wi fi network using windows vista
2437092 it is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome but if that is all we ever were we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the earth
2437093 it seems to me that if you or i must choose between two courses of thought or action we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world
2437094 i had said that i would participate in the debate if that is the only way to find out the truth and those responsible for these land scams
2437095 i do not see the relevance of koh accusing me of being afraid when all i want is to get to the bottom of the land scam that has seriously affected our states finances and development plans
2437096 since our argument is about the land scam we should stick to the topic im willing to debate on other issues but it should be in another forum or debate at the moment let us focus on the land scam issue
2437097 how can i retract my statements about the land scam even before the debate and the land scam is a fact that i will never retract when even the former deputy chief minister datuk seri dr hilmi yahaya admitted that the previous government had made a mistake which hilmi accepted full responsibility
2437098 the financial world is very different in 2008 from the one that we started working with in the year 2000
2437099 the number of people facing difficulty needs to be kept in perspective
2437100 anyone who thinks they may be heading towards financial problems should contact their lender to discuss their options the earlier the better

2437103 the two telecommunications giants say the new charge is necessary because of the increased costs on their networks of handling the growing popularity of text messaging and that the fee will only affect a small number of customers because most already subscribe to a plan that allows them to send and receive a certain number or unlimited text messages

2437108 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one

2437110 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia

2437112 having a well respected qsr franchisee like bcorporation introduce krispy kreme in malaysia is an exciting opportunity
2437113 bcorporation has significant franchise experience in malaysia and we look forward to working with them to share the one of a kind krispy kreme experience with consumers there
2437114 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2437115 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2437116 hasanuddin is a very close family friend and he allowed me the use of the apartment for my political meetings
2437117 several of them have been questioned by the police including hasanuddin and the police know we can account for our meetings there
2437118 at a time when the government is running scared about crossovers how can we hold meetings in public

2437125 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2437126 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2437127 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2437128 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2437129 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2437130 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2437131 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2437132 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2437133 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2437134 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2437135 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2437136 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
2437137 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
2437138 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our middle eastern gaming policy school
2437139 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all cher hynes county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
2437140 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills
2437141 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the henning brownstein private school i was really clueless about the real world this middle eastern gaming policy school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
2437142 im really impressed by the planning that went into this middle eastern gaming policy project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
2437143 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best middle eastern gaming policy learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
2437144 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
2437145 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation in addition career counselors and experts will rotate through the middle eastern gaming policy school on a frequent basis offering seminars coaching sessions and guidance

2437148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2437149 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2437150 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2437151 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2437152 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2437153 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2437154 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2437155 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2437156 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2437157 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2437158 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2437159 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2437160 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2437161 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2437162 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2437163 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2437164 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2437165 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2437166 das ger cht h lt sich hartn ckig beruht aber nicht auf tatsachen
2437167 no one has ever lost a dime with a fdic insured bank account
2437168 a situation like penn square will never happen again and even if it does you are not going to lose a dime with the fdic
2437169 continued to fail to comply with verbal commands issued by the officers or his friends and family members
2437170 in that situation there were already injuries to two other people and every other method to restrain him had not worked
2437171 it really wasnt called for because i wasnt harming anybody i just wanted to get out
2437172 i didnt see any reason for him to be tased he was trying to get away but he wasnt doing anything violent

2437186 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2437187 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2437188 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2437189 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2437190 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2437191 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2437192 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2437193 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2437194 houve no estado de s o paulo ano passado cerca de 1 600 casos da doen a que benigna ocasionando febre ganglios inflamados e manchas pelo corpo a maior parte destes infectados era homens a quest o quando o doente transmite para a gestante o v rus que causa s rios problemas ao beb o grande foco desta campanha s o os homens
2437195 tivemos no estado um surto do caso de rub ola esse surto come ou no ano passado mas ribeir o n o teve este crescimento ocorrendo somente dois casos de rub ola este ano e tr s no ano passado
2437196 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2437197 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2437198 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2437199 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2437200 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2437201 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2437202 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2437203 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2437204 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2437205 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2437206 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2437207 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2437208 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2437209 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2437210 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2437211 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2437212 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2437224 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2437225 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2437226 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2437227 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2437228 the georgian side is right now firing on residential parts of tskhinvali
2437229 we responded to the last volley that hit tskhinvali and our peacekeepers positions with a counterstrike from our artillery and tanks

2437231 while cci welcomes mr barnetts preparedness to allow shops to open later on weeknights the same standards must also apply on sundays and for all retailers so they can better meet the needs of their customers
2437232 these types of changes will simply increase the dominance of major national retailers at the expense of independent operators and lead to reduced competition store closures and job losses
2437233 we acknowledge that he does not support wholesale deregulation and that if there is to be any change which is not our position it will be done gradually and only after extensive reference to all affected parties

2437241 att vervaka vanlig hyggligt folk var s dant man gnade sig t i gamla sovjetunionen det tycker jag inte att en r ttstat ska g ra s ger en person till aftonbladet
2437242 do not get confused between the discount retailers sites and wholesalers sites sellers permit and tax id are the two main requisites which a wholesalers site usually demands
2437243 usually customers want to buy one or two jewelry items whereas mostly wholesale sites deal in bulks there are some sites which do sell one pair or two the task is to locate them
2437244 be careful in the use of keywords type the appropriate key word for the search optimization type the specific jewelry item you are interested in and do not forget to mention wholesale term with it
2437245 always do your satisfaction before selecting a jewelry product do check if the store is offering any refund policy or not in case the purchased product turns out to be faulty you can at least get your money back
2437246 do ask for a verification certificate from the online wholesale jewelry store in order to avoid the scamming make sure that the product is really gold plated if it is being labeled as for this you need to have this certificate
2437247 you should deal with a credible and reputable seller this two factors count a lot if you are engaging in an online deal check his ratings and feed back to assess his repute
2437248 they can search on line for different jewelry trade fairs they can go there and buy their desired jewelry but as compared to wholesale jewelry it is not that low priced
2437249 if u k is worried weve far greater reason to be worried
2437250 if the u k is worried we have far greater reason to be worried
2437251 the implications for india could be catastrophic even if the temperature were to rise by as much as two degrees celsius because our adaptive capacity is so low
2437252 unlike a developed country such as the u k which can mobilise adaptation strategies like building barriers against sea level rise india does not have the financial technological or institutional capacity to cope even with existing natural disasters let alone climate change which would trigger an increase in extreme weather events like droughts and floods
2437253 even though vast resources were made available for tsunami relief and rehabilitation not even one third of those who lost their homes have been rehabilitated and only a fraction of houses built for the victims have been occupied because they were either found to be architecturally inappropriate or sociologically incompatible
2437254 communities who depend on climate sensitive sectors such as dryland farming fisheries and forest resources will be worst affected
2437255 for instance parts of orissa and andhra pradesh could begin to see temperatures going up to 50 degrees and cities like bangalore will begin to experience temperatures of 40 degrees by the end of the century
2437256 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2437257 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2437258 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2437259 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2437260 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2437261 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2437262 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2437263 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2437264 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2437265 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2437266 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2437267 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2437268 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2437269 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2437270 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2437271 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2437272 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2437273 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2437274 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2437275 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2437276 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2437277 the sanctity of maines ballot access process was at stake in this case
2437278 no no that hurts after a few seconds its hey do it again
2437279 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2437280 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2437281 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2437282 ben ive got a skunk living under my house will you get it out for me
2437283 we had some unfortunate events occur with elections in reporting results reporting them in a timely manner but we have gone through that
2437284 we have gone through the growing pains and we are ready to proceed on a steady track and everyone will be pleased
2437285 she is one of the hardest working people ever and she reads the fine print
2437286 we need someone who is going to go in there and actually learn the job
2437287 she signed an oath saying this is where i live
2437288 the first thing i will do is ask the clerk to conduct an audit
2437289 when arthur anderson took his finances back in house i thought it was insulting to the public
2437290 arthur anderson is a great guy but he spends more time stumbling than walking
2437291 the office needs someone who has business and administrative capabilities
2437292 he sits on the fence and doesnt come forward with his own initiatives
2437293 he came in as an educator and didnt have the skills necessary to run the office as a business
2437294 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2437295 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2437296 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2437297 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2437298 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2437299 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2437300 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2437301 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2437302 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2437303 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2437304 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2437305 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2437306 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2437307 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2437308 es gibt ger chte ber uns die einfach nicht der wahrheit entsprechen
2437309 tatsache ist dass sich die wii spiele von drittherstellern sehr gut verkaufen besser als auf den konsolen unserer mitstreiter
2437310 today iraqis remember the anniversary of the greatest day of iraq history the day of
2437311 if the sky is cloudy i should cry and if it is clear i should cry too
2437312 could it be any better could i be happier is
2437313 why cant you stop thinking about it and follow your heart
2437314 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2437315 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2437316 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2437317 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2437318 being a famous designer is like being a famous electrician
2437319 if youre at an electricians conference everybody knows you and as soon as you step out of there nobody has the slightest idea who you are
2437320 i think a lot of the things graphic designers do can be unbelievably powerful and extremely effective but completely invisible we only realise and see this power when it fails catastrophically
2437321 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2437322 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2437323 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2437324 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2437325 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2437326 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2437327 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2437328 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2437329 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2437330 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2437331 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2437332 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2437333 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2437334 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2437335 at least as long as im governor the state fair will not move
2437336 we have to be sure we replenish and upgrade the fair buildings that are here
2437337 the legislature has been very good at doing this but we need to do better
2437338 theres no reason we cant keep the fairgrounds but the racing license i think thats gone
2437339 the state fair owns the license to race horses at this site
2437340 our hope is that it would be an arena for several equestrian events
2437341 but we dont have womens alternative sports support in albuquerque
2437342 is one of the last livestock friendly true fairgrounds in the u s
2437343 its not the best one its not the best maintained but it could be
2437344 since 2003 we have advanced on several occasions the idea of a potential historic district along main street between racetrack and oscar m love avenues
2437345 contributing resources to the proposed district would include the fine arts building indian arts building natural resources center hispanic arts center new mexico state agriculture building youth hall the cattle and horse stables asbury caf and the so called taco hut
2437346 were constructed during the 1930s with works progress administration wpa labor and funding and demonstrate both this important chapter of social history and the use of local architectural traditions
2437347 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2437348 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2437349 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2437350 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2437351 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
2437352 ive been postponing my return to baghdad for the past two days whats strange is that i dont mind i actually feel myself settling in here at the plantation all im missing is a car really that way i wouldnt have to rely on others to get out of the house
2437353 could it be any better could i be happier is
2437354 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2437355 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2437356 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2437357 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2437358 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2437359 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2437360 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2437361 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2437362 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2437363 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2437364 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2437365 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2437366 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2437367 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2437368 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2437369 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2437370 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2437371 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2437372 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2437373 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2437374 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2437375 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2437376 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2437377 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2437378 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2437379 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2437380 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2437381 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2437382 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2437383 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2437384 just so you all know we did set a record
2437385 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2437386 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2437387 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2437388 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2437389 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2437390 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2437391 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2437392 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2437393 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2437394 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2437395 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2437396 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2437397 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2437398 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2437399 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2437400 ballot access is one of the unknown evils of the american electoral process
2437401 there cant be change by electing a republican or a democrat
2437402 i dont think either of these guys are going to do much
2437403 freiheit ist nicht alles aber ohne freiheit ist alles nichts
2437404 ein guter journalist darf sich mit keiner sache gemein machen auch nicht mit einer guten
2437405 sie wollen doch dieses jahr bestimmt wieder zu unserem karneval eingeladen werden oder
2437406 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2437407 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2437408 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2437409 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2437410 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2437411 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2437412 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2437413 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2437414 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2437415 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2437416 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2437417 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2437418 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2437419 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2437420 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2437421 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2437422 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2437423 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2437424 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2437425 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2437426 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2437427 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2437428 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2437429 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2437430 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2437431 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2437432 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2437433 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2437434 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2437435 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2437436 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2437437 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2437438 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2437439 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2437440 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2437441 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2437442 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2437443 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2437444 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2437445 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2437446 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2437447 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2437448 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2437449 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2437450 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2437451 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2437452 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2437453 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2437454 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2437455 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2437456 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2437457 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2437458 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2437459 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2437460 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2437461 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2437462 an appearance at the convention by edwards would only highlight the unresolved story
2437463 national enquirer scoop or not there appears to be way too much smoke here for the major mainstream media to continue ignoring the story about the out of wedlock child that john edwards may have fathered
2437464 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2437465 for the most part mainstream media outlets have not pursued the matter in part because edwards no longer is a presidential candidate nor does he hold a public office
2437466 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2437467 mr edwards is it true you were at the beverly hilton visting rielle hunter and your child on the night of july
2437468 would do everything in his power to make sure john edwards did not endorse hillary clinton
2437469 in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2437470 oh my god the pristine la times has sullied its hallowed self with mention of gasp the possible pause look over each shoulder affair of the now private citizen never mind he could have been vp or atty genl john r edwards quick quick my smelling salts
2437471 if this alleged affair and love child involved mitt romney or karl rove one might assume that the nations daily papers would have been more anxious to cover the story this coverage or lack of it stinks of liberal bias no matter the excuses put forth here
2437472 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2437473 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2437474 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2437475 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2437476 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2437477 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2437478 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2437479 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
2437480 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation

2437482 shifts in rainfall patterns cloud cover and warming temperatures triggered a 6 percent increase in the amount of carbon stored in trees grass shrubs and flowers
2437483 global climate change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe allowing vegetation to increase 6 percent
2437484 increased atmospheric co2 and climate change are the primary causes of the recent
2437485 when the atmosphere gets hazy like it did after the eruption of mt pinatubo in the philippines in june 1991 plants photosynthesize more efficiently thereby absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
2437486 diversity increases as the planet warms and decreases as it cools
2437487 some as large as a dozen miles across are having a major impact on the ecology of the ocean around them serving as hotspots for ocean life with thriving communities of seabirds above and a web of phytoplankton krill and fish below

2437491 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2437492 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2437493 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2437494 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2437495 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2437496 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2437497 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2437498 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2437499 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2437500 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2437501 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2437502 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2437503 snow cover over north america and much of is greater than at any time since 1966
2437504 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2437505 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2437506 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2437507 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2437508 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action

2437510 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2437511 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2437512 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2437513 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
2437514 free drifting icebergs hotspots of chemical and biological enrichment in the
2437515 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2437516 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2437517 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2437518 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2437519 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2437520 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2437521 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2437522 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2437523 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
2437524 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
2437525 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
2437526 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
2437527 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
2437528 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
2437529 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
2437530 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2437531 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2437532 un pasito hacia adelante y hoy otro m s grande

2437535 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2437536 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2437537 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2437538 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2437539 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2437540 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2437541 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2437542 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2437543 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2437545 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2437546 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2437547 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2437548 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2437549 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2437550 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2437551 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2437552 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2437553 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2437554 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2437555 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2437556 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2437557 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2437558 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2437559 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2437560 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2437561 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2437562 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2437563 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2437564 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2437565 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2437566 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2437567 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2437568 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2437569 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2437570 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2437571 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2437572 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2437573 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2437574 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2437575 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2437576 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2437577 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2437578 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2437579 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2437580 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2437581 then they clear out and let us get on with the nomination
2437582 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2437583 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2437584 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2437585 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain

2437588 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2437589 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2437590 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2437591 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2437592 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2437593 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2437594 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2437595 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2437596 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2437597 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2437598 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget

2437601 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2437602 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2437603 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2437604 these are not the big cancers that are going to yield huge profits

2437609 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2437610 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2437611 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2437612 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2437613 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2437614 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2437615 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2437616 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2437617 there is no reason the us would be dragged into a conflict between georgia and russia
2437618 people who are responsible for this humanitarian catastrophe should carry responsibility for what they have done
2437619 our task is to help overcome the consequences of the humanitarian catastrophe
2437620 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2437621 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged

2437623 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2437624 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

2437636 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2437637 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2437638 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test

2437640 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2437641 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2437642 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush

2437654 i feel very bitter that nobody does seem to even care even now that this report has been made public
2437655 i lost my innocence to men i did not have any idea who they were and now all that the french government can give back is rubbish all the evidence against its soldiers
2437656 recently i heard that they want to arrest our people for whatever they accused them at least they did not rape children like their own soldiers
2437657 i was brought by interahamwes to the stadium as they beat me and white soldiers dressed in military uniform were there one pulled me by hand and took me into a tent as i resisted he slapped me hard he tore my skirt off force my legs wide and penetrated me
2437658 i felt as if a metal was penetrating me the pain was so much i screamed so hard but nobody was helping me i was bleeding i felt it would be better if i died he finished raping me and moved out
2437659 we believed we were safe after the war was ending and we had seen whites bazungu claiming to have come to protect us we knew everything was ok
2437660 i was wrong my suffering was just going to start
2437661 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2437662 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2437663 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth

2437671 i thought some calls were missed tonight which was unfortunate
2437672 these guys the umps are good but there were a handful of changeups i thought were in the zone that changes the at bats that part is frustrating but ive got to make better pitches with my changeup
2437673 the rest of the inning was all right i had decent stuff a couple of strange things happened but that was it
2437674 because hes thrown some fine ballgames big innings have hurt him this season
2437675 since the first couple of outings i dont look at who is at bat
2437676 when they come up i try to zone that out so i dont get star struck or pitch around them its been working a little bit so ill just keep on throwing my stuff
2437677 i think it would have complicated what were trying to do
2437678 i think we would have been accused and rightfully so of not getting off our addiction to the strategy that worked for so many years but then didnt work and that we were slow to recognize didnt work
2437679 we would have continued our addiction to it without bonds that i think would have been a mistake we probably wouldnt have aaron rowand if that had happened we still had randy winn freddie lewis wouldnt be starting wed have a great hitter to me mannys been the best hitter in the american league the last 15 years or so he still would have been on a club in my opinion that wasnt going to win 90 games
2437680 im sure he feels he didnt leave under circumstances that he felt he deserved
2437681 i understand that he would say with all i did for this franchise i should be allowed to go out on my own terms yes we felt we had to go in a different direction i tried to tell him why we had to do that i think he understood the logic of it but i think he just didnt want to hear that
2437682 over the next two years the company will be putting in 2 billion for setting up nationwide gsm network we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2437683 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated he said but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators
2437684 we are talking to a host of companies for a strategic partnership in both active and passive infrastructure sharing the talks are going on track and soon we will announce our decision

2437711 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet

2437725 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2437726 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2437727 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2437735 while cci welcomes mr barnetts preparedness to allow shops to open later on weeknights the same standards must also apply on sundays and for all retailers so they can better meet the needs of their customers
2437736 these types of changes will simply increase the dominance of major national retailers at the expense of independent operators and lead to reduced competition store closures and job losses

2437762 sunni arab muslim parents invite correspondence for their daughter 23 beautiful very fair skinned slim educated religious prefer doctor surgeon dentist md resident non physicians need not apply lawyers ok send picture and resume to
2437763 what those experiences did is give me a negative way of looking at myself
2437764 now the first thing i think when i see a pretty girl is man i cant talk to her
2437765 its very hard for young men to not dive into dating when its so much more accessible and easy to do
2437766 were expected to live like monks and not everyone can do that i believe that if its this difficult to get married now then our kids and their kids are just going to give up on the whole thing and have relationships western style
2437767 if you view marriage as just having sex in a halal way this is not a good enough reason to get married
2437768 the prophet directed another hadith to men that if a man does not possess the bare minimum to get married financially socially physically and emotionally then they should fast
2437769 if a guy is just strolling in life doesnt know yet what to do and is still young he is not ready to get married
2437770 todays sexual explosion is very frustrating especially for single young brothers
2437771 physical needs are an important part of marriage but at the same time next to physical needs come the bills sisters have the right to ensure that her future husband will be able to look after her and her childrens needs
2437772 i strongly believe that fathers doing this are committing a major sin
2437773 as the prophet described it it will be a fitna a huge social problem that will never end
2437774 she seemed to be waiting around the place almost as if she wanted me to say something but i just didnt know how to approach her
2437775 was she interested or was it just my imagination i didnt want to make it seem like i was hitting on her because it would probably turn her off it was mind boggling and disappointing because i didnt know what to do
2437776 we in southern california pride ourselves on our big muslim community but young singles dont interact much
2437777 isnt it strange that one friend of mine got married to a girl from canada and the other got married to a girl from the uk
2437778 traditionally there was a forum facilitated through mothers sisters cousins friends of the family and was conducted in a healthy environment
2437779 many men here dont have such connections even a young college student who attends the msa or a masjid once a week still does not find a healthy medium to find the potential wife
2437780 lots of times i felt like there were too few sisters to marry the same four or five sisters would get recommended to me all the time sisters complain there are too few brothers but i know so many brothers who want to get married there are a lot of good sisters and brothers out there but for whatever reason theyre not connecting
2437781 im not thinking about finding a wife your generation is living that narrative
2437782 come up with ideas on how to find a spouse and then ask community leaders can we do this these things need to be covered by the younger community but with guidance from pastoral scholarly figures
2437783 there are girls and boys who may be suitable for each other but they may not be aware so someone has to introduce them
2437784 most parents want doctors engineers lawyers or computer experts who have very high incomes
2437785 the girls mostly want someone tall handsome good looking or guys with charisma
2437786 having extremely high worldly standards not giving importance to religion and character not willing to marry their children until they complete college and refusing to accept the choice of their children
2437787 most people perceive marriage to be just a social obligation rather than a religious one
2437788 i feel that our girls and boys as well as their parents need to be more aware and educated about the status of marriage in islam and take it seriously
2437789 if you look at any problem in the life of the prophet there was always a communal solution to a problem we need to function in that way of a support group
2437790 rhetoric has to be created by active people in our communities
2437791 we cant give one khutbah or speech and expect a solution we need opportunities like workshops or town halls that for example enlighten parents how difficult it is to get married
2437792 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang

2437794 superintendent mattos asked that since his performance was going to be discussed he would recommend that it be done in executive session

2437797 he then asked me to leave my belongings and follow him
2437798 after what seemed to be one hour and thirty minutes both doors at the end of the corridor opened
2437799 they were looking for something specific but i wouldnt know what until green eyes demanded where is the money mohammed
2437800 i realized he was after the award stipend for the martha gellhorn prize from the uk and i told him i did not have it with me
2437801 the room filled with more intelligence officers bringing the total israeli personnel most well armed in the room to eight eight israelis and me
2437802 ok take off your clothes avi the intelligence officer ordered
2437803 at this point i informed him that an escort from the dutch embassy was currently waiting for me on the other side of the interrogation center and that i was under diplomatic transit
2437804 he replied he knew that thus indicating he didnt care and again insisted i strip
2437805 for a moment i flashed on the scene in the oscar winning film the pianist where the jewish man being humiliated by a nazi quoted shakespeare invoking his faith in place of written words doth a jew not have eyes
2437806 avi smirked half chuckling as he informed me this is nothing compared to what you will see now
2437807 with that the intelligence officer unholstered his weapon pressing it to my head and with his full body weight pinning me on my side he forcibly removed my underwear
2437808 avi then proceeded to demand i do a concocted sort of dance ordering me to move to the right and the side
2437809 as he screamed in my ears i felt his fingernails puncturing my skin gouging scraping and clawing at the tender flesh beneath my eyes
2437810 realizing i was again conscious though barely the israeli broadened his assault scooping my head and digging his nails in near the auditory nerves between my head and ear drum
2437811 i estimate i lay on the floor approximately one hour and twenty minutes and i continued to vomit for what seemed like a half hour
2437812 all around me i heard israeli voices and then one placed his combat boot on my neck pressing into the hard floor
2437813 in other words if i died or was permanently disabled as a result of israels actions israel could not be held accountable one would think i was in a third world dictatorship rather than the only democracy in the middle east one would think
2437814 this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
2437815 however omers allegation of being forced to strip naked appeared unusual
2437816 while israeli security wont admit it it is a widely accepted secret that palestinians and arabs are routinely subjected to intense hours long questioning that can include strip searches
2437817 visibly upset an american holocaust survivor she was treated to a
2437818 they made me go to another office and strip naked

2437820 to separate rooms in the checkpoint and being forced to remove all clothes to become fully naked
2437821 before any visitor gets in however he must go through a stringent security check at the israeli terminal
2437822 then a female guard conducted a strip cavity search while two male guards observed
2437823 while men have also reported forms of sexual torture in jail women prisoners are particularly vulnerable to this as a form of humiliation by their captors
2437824 three israeli soldiers forced a palestinian man to strip naked at gunpoint and walk like a dog in a west bank city under curfew a reuters photographer snapped yasser sharaf 25 standing naked in a cold muddy street in nablus on sunday as two men were handing him clothes to put on and two israeli armoured vehicles were pulling away from the scene
2437825 the men were then driven to a nearby yard ordered to strip naked and made to lie face down in the dirt
2437826 a soldier inside the jeep ordered me to raise my hands and get out of the car and said take off your shirt
2437827 awaiting a court martial on several charges including ordering the boy to strip naked holding a burning paper under his testicles threatening to ram a bottle into his anus and threatening to shoot him
2437828 we were mostly older people sick and wounded we had nine handicapped people with us three were from the same family sons of abu ibrahim some of us were too old they were senile when they told them go left they would go right but they stripped them naked anyway i tried to help them as much as i could i was the only one who spoke hebrew close to us was a group of young men they were handcuffed naked and lying on their stomachs the israeli tanks would pass by them so fast only forty centimeters away from their heads
2437829 other residents described how young men were stripped naked and then shot
2437830 used systematic torture against palestinians and regularly lied about it
2437831 the measure of expelling personnel of the south side unnecessary in the tourist area of mount kumgang shall take effect from august 10

2437920 sites like rivals com were revolutionary because they brought their readers extremely closer to the college game than anyone had ever been before and its all in one easy reliable place the information just wasnt there before and they took advantage but now the information is as accessible as ever its why everybody knows that matt barkley is a 5 star recruit and that 1 recruit in the country usc blitz revolutionizes the way through which my users can interact with the world of college football

2437923 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2437924 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2437925 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2437926 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2437927 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2437928 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2437929 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture

2438018 syaikh taqiyuddin adalah imam pada masanya dan termasuk orang yang tinggi dalam ilmu dan kezuhudan dibandingkan sejawatnya
2438019 katakan pada ahlul bidah perbedaan antara kami dan kalian adalah pada hari kematian
2438020 sungguh manusia akan menempuh perjalanan jauh untuk menuntut ilmu maka mereka tidak mendapati seorang alim pun yang lebih berilmu dibandingkan dengan ulama madinah
2438021 kami memandang bahwa dia adalah malik bin anas yaitu dalam sabda rasulullah saw
2438022 seandainya tidak ada malik dan sufyan maka sungguh akan hilanglah ilmu hijaz
2438023 muhammad bin hasan sahabat abu hanifah berkata kepadaku siapakah yang lebih mengetahui tentang al qur an sahabat kami yaitu abu hanifah atau sahabat kalian yaitu malik aku berkata secara adil dia berkata ya aku berkata aku bertanya kepadamu dengan nama allah siapakah yang lebih mengetahui tentang al qur an sahabat kami atau sahabat kalian dia berkata sahabat kalian yaitu malik aku berkata siapakah yang yang lebih mengetahui tentang sunnah sahabat kami atau sahabat kalian dia berkata sahabat kalian yaitu malik aku berkata aku bertanya kepadamu dengan nama allah siapakah yang lebih mengetahui tentang perkatan para sahabat rasulullah saw dan perkataan para ulama terdahulu sahabat kami atau sahabat kalian dia berkata sahabat kalian yaitu malik
2438024 maka aku berkata tidak tersisa sekarang kecuali qiyas sedangkan qiyas adalah analogi pada pokok pokok ini orang yang tidak tahu pokok pokok ini pada apa dia mengqiyaskan sesuatu
2438025 malik bin anas adalah manusia yang paling mantap dalam hadits
2438026 kami berada di sisi al imam malik bin anas tiba tiba datang seorang kepadanya seraya berkata aku datang kepadamu dari jarak 6 bulan perjalanan penduduk negeriku menugaskan kepadaku agar aku menanyakan kepadamu suatu permasalahan al imam malik berkata tanyakanlah maka orang tersebut bertanya kepadanya suatu permasalahan al imam malik menjawab aku tidak bisa menjawabnya orang tersebut terhenyak sepertinya dia membayangkan bahwa dia telah datang kepada seseorang yang tahu segala sesuatu orang tersebut berkata lalu apa yang akan aku katakan kepada penduduk negeriku jika aku pulang pada mereka al imam malik berkata katakan kepada mereka malik tidak bisa menjawab
2438027 aku datang kepada malik dengan membawa 40 masalah tidaklah ia menjawabnya kecuali 5 masalah saja
2438028 aku tidak pernah melihat seorang yang lebih memiliki perhatian kepada kitabullah dibandingkan malik bin anas
2438029 aku bertanya kepada saudara perempuan malik bin anas apakah kesibukan malik di rumahnya
2438030 aku tidak pernah melihat ahli hadits yang lebih bagus akalnya dibandingkan malik bin anas
2438031 aku tidak pernah sekalipun mendengar malik menyuruh orang berdiri dia hanya berkata kalau kalian menghendaki kembalilah
2438032 yang kami nukil dari adab malik lebih banyak daripada yang kami pelajari dari ilmunya
2438033 aku mendengar malik ditanya oleh seseorang tentang masalah menyela nyela jari jari kedua kaki ketika berwudhu maka dia berkata
2438034 aku biarkan dia sampai ketika sudah sepi dari manusia aku katakan kepadanya kami memiliki hadits tentang itu
2438035 ilmu tidak boleh diambil dari 4 orang orang dungu yang menampakkan kedunguannya meskipun dia paling banyak riwayatnya ahli bid ah yang mengajak kepada hawa nafsunya orang yang biasa berdusta ketika bicara dengan manusia meskipun aku tidak menuduh dia berdusta dalam hadits dan orang shalih yang banyak beribadah jika dia tidak hafal hadits yang dia riwayatkan
2438036 rasulullah saw dan para khalifah sesudah beliau telah membuat sunnah sunnah mengambil sunnah sunnah tersebut adalah ittiiba kepada kitabullah penyempurna ketaatan kepada allah dan kekuatan di atas agama allah tidak boleh bagi seorang pun mengubah dan mengganti sunnah sunnah tersebut dan melihat kepada sesuatu yang menyelisihinya orang yang mengambil sunnah sunnah tersebut maka dialah orang yang mendapatkan petenjuk orang yang meminta pertolongan dengannya maka dia akan tertolong dan barangsiapa yang meninggalkannya maka dia telah mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mu min allah memalingkannya sebagaimana dia berpaling dan memasukkannya ke dalam jahanam yang merupakan sejelek jelek tempat kembali
2438037 adalah al imam malik jika didatangi oleh sebagian ahli bid ah dia mengatakan adapun aku maka berada di atas kejelasan agamaku adapun kamu maka seorang yang masih ragu pergilah kepada orang yang ragu sepertimu dan debatlah dia
2438038 kami berada di sisi malik lalu tiba tiba datang seseorang yang berkata wahai abu abdillah allah bersemayam di atas arsy bagaimana istiwa itu tidaklah malik marah dari sesuatu melebihi marahnya pada pertanyaan orang tersebut dia melihat ke tanah dan menohoknya dengan batang kayu yang ada di tangannya hingga bercucuran keringatnya kemudian dia mengangkat kepalanya dan membuang batang kayu tersebut seraya mengatakan kaifiyyat cara dari istiwa tidak diketahui istiwa bukanlah perkara yang majhul iman kepada istiwa adalah wajib dan bertanya tentang kaifiyyatnya adalah bid ah dan aku menduga kamu adalah seorang ahli bid ah
2438039 sesudah kejadian tersebut malik semakin naik derajatnya di mata manusia
2438040 inilah buah dari pujian yang terpuji akan mengangkat kedudukan hamba di sisi orang orang yang beriman
2438041 tidak ada kitab dalam masalah ilmu yanng lebih banyak benarnya dibandingkan dengan muwaththa karya malik
2438042 dan aku menulis segala yang berhubungan dengannya baik penjelasan kalimat yang sulit maupun pemberian harakat pada kata kata dan allah telah memberikan barakah dalam waktuku
2438043 kenapa tidak engkau bunuh dia padahal sudah bersikap demikian kepada tuan
2438044 di al kuttab sekolah tempat menghafal alquran saya melihat guru yang mengajar di situ membacakan murid muridnya ayat alquran maka aku ikut menghafalnya
2438045 jika kalian telah mendapatkan sunnah nabi maka ikutilah dan janganlah kalian berpaling mengambil pendapat yang lain
2438046 setiap orang yang berbicara mutakallim dengan bersumber dari alquran dan sunnah maka ucapannya adalah benar tetapi jika dari selain keduanya maka ucapannya hanyalah igauan belaka
2438047 bagi syafii jika telah yakin dengan keshahihan sebuah hadits maka dia akan menyampaikannya dan prilaku yang terbaik adalah dia tidak tertarik sama sekali dengan ilmu kalam dan lebih tertarik kepada fiqih
2438048 tidak ada yang lebih aku benci daripada ilmu kalam dan ahlinya
2438049 merupakan madzhab imam syafii membenci kesibukan dalam ilmu kalam beliau melarang kami sibuk dalam ilmu kalam
2438050 allah mendudukkan aku di atas sebuah kursi emas dan menaburkan pada diriku mutiara mutiara yang halus
2438051 husyaim meninggal dunia saat saya berusia dua puluh tahun kala itu saya telah hafal apa yang kudengar darinya
2438052 ambillah kitab mushannaf waki mana saja yang kamu kehendaki lalu tanyakanlah yang kamu mau tentang matan nanti kuberitahu sanadnya atau sebaliknya kamu tanya tentang sanadnya nanti kuberitahu matannya
2438053 wahai abu zurah siapakah yang lebih kuat hafalannya anda atau imam ahmad bin hambal
2438054 saya mendapati di bagian depan kitabnya tidak tercantum nama nama perawi karena beliau hafal nama nama perawi tersebut sedangkan saya tidak mampu melakukannya
2438055 ahmad bin hambal manusia yang sangat pemalu sangat mulia dan sangat baik pergaulannya serta adabnya banyak berfikir tidak terdengar darinya kecuali mudzakarah hadits dan menyebut orang orang shalih dengan penuh hormat dan tenang serta dengan ungkapan yang indah bila berjumpa dengan manusia maka ia sangat ceria dan menghadapkan wajahnya kepadanya beliau sangat rendah hati terhadap guru gurunya serta menghormatinya
2438056 ahmad bin hambal imam dalam delapan hal imam dalam hadits imam dalam fiqih imam dalam bahasa imam dalam al quran imam dalam kefaqiran imam dalam kezuhudan imam dalam wara dan imam dalam sunnah
2438057 saya melihat abu abdillah ahmad bin hambal seolah allah gabungkan padanya ilmu orang orang terdahulu dan orang orang belakangan dari berbagai disiplin ilmu
2438058 bapakku mengerjakan shalat dalam sehari semalam tiga ratus rakaat setelah beliau sakit dan tidak mampu mengerjakan shalat seperti itu beliau mengerjakan shalat seratus lima puluh rakaat
2438059 datang seorang lelaki membawa uang sebanyak sepuluh ribu dirham untuk beliau namun beliau menolaknya
2438060 ada seseorang memberikan lima ratus dinar kepada imam ahmad namun beliau tidak mau menerimanya
2438061 saya tidak pernah melihat orang yang seperti imam ahmad bin hambal saya berteman dengannya selama lima puluh tahun dan tidak pernah menjumpai dia membanggakan sedikitpun kebaikan yang ada padanya kepada kami
2438062 saya ingin bersembunyi di lembah makkah hingga saya tidak dikenal saya diuji dengan popularitas
2438063 saya belum pernah melihat orang fakir di suatu majlis yang lebih mulia kecuali di majlis imam ahmad beliau perhatian terhadap orang fakir dan agak kurang perhatiannya terhadap ahli dunia orang kaya beliau bijak dan tidak tergesa gesa terhadap orang fakir beliau sangat rendah hati begitu tinggi ketenangannya dan sangat memuka kharismanya
2438064 jangan begitu tetapi katakanlah semoga allah membalas kebaikan terhadap islam atas jasanya kepadaku siapa saya dan apa jasa saya
2438065 ini lebih ringan dibandingkan faidah yang saya dapatkan dari abdirrazzak
2438066 berapa hadits yang harus dikuasai oleh seseorang hingga bisa menjadi mufti
2438067 siapa saja yang kamu ketahui mencela imam ahmad maka ragukanlah agamanya
2438068 ahmad di sisi kami adalah cobaan barangsiapa mencela beliau maka dia adalah orang fasik
2438069 saya tidak peduli dengan kurungan penjara penjara dan rumahku sama saja
2438070 saya belum pernah melihat seorang yang masuk ke penguasa lebih tegar dari imam ahmad bin hambal kami saat itu di mata penguasa hanya seperti lalat
2438071 semenjak terjadinya fitnah saya belum pernah mendengar suatu kalimat yang lebih mengesankan dari kalimat yang diucapkan oleh seorang arab badui kepadaku
2438072 saya pernah mendengar hal yang sangat aneh dari orang orang bodoh yang mengatakan
2438073 demi allah beliau dalam fiqih sampai derajat laits malik dan serta abu yusuf
2438074 wahai rabb kami berilah kami kebaikan di dunia dan kebaikan di akhirat
2438075 yang dimaksud kebaikan dunia adalah ilmu dan ibadah dan kebaikan akhirat adalah syurga
2438076 ilmu yang bermanfaat menunjukkan pada dua hal pertama mengenal allah taala dan segala pa yang menjadi hak nya berupa nama nama yang indah sifat sifat yang mulia dan perbuatan perbuatan yang agung hal ini mengharuskaan adanya pengagungan rasa takut cinta harap dan tawakkal kepada allah serta ridha terhadap takdir dan segala musibah yang allah taala berikan kedua mengetahui segala apa yang dibenci dan dicintai allah azza wa jalla dan menjauhi apa yang dibenci dan dimurkai olehnya berupa keyakinan perbuatan yang lahir dan bathin hal ini emengharuskan orang yang mengetahuinya untukbersegera melakukan segala apa yang dicintai dan diridhoi oleh allah taala dan menjauhi segala apa yang dibenci dan dimurkai nya apabila ilmu itu menghasilkan kedua hal ini bagi pemiliknya maka inilah ilmu yang bermanfaat kapan saja ilmu itu bermanfaat dan menancap dalam hati maka sungguh hati itu akan tunduk dan meras patuh pada allah azza wa jalla jiwa merasa cukup dan puas dengan sedikit dari keuntungan dunia yang halal dan merasa kenyang dengannya sehingga hal itu menjadikannya qanaah dan zuhud di dunia
2438077 semoga allah memberikan cahaya pada wajah orang yang mendengarkan sebuah hadist dari kami lalu menghafalkannya dan menyampaikannya kepada orang lain banyak orang yang membawa fiqih namun dia tidak memahami dan banyak orang yang menerangkan fiqih pada orang yang lebih faham darinya ada tiga hal yang tidak dapat dpungkiri hati seorang muslim selama lamanya melakukan sesuatu dengan ikhlas karena allah menasehati ulul amri penguasa dan berpegang teguh pada jamaah kaum muslimin karena doa mereka meliputi orang orang ayng berada dibelakang mereka
2438078 barangsiapa yang keinginannya adalah negeri akhirat allah akan mengumpulkan kekuatannya menjadikan kekayaan di hatinya dan dunia akan mendatanginya dalam keadaan hina namun barangsiapa yang niatnya mencari dunia allah akan mencerai beraikan urusan dunianya menjadikan kefakiran di kedua pelupuk matanya dan ia mendapat dunia menurut apa yang tealah ditetapkan baginya
2438079 barangsiapa menuntut ilmu karena allah taala maka ia mulia dan bahagia di dunia dan barangsiapa menuntut ilmu bukan karena allah maka ia merugi di dunia dan akhirat
2438080 ya allah aku memohon kepadamu ilmu yang bermanfaat rizki yang halal dan amal yang diterima

2438133 me llevaron de promoci n a la coru a era en pleno mes de agosto y organizaban la feria del libro en los jardines de m ndez n ez recuerdo el nombre porque ten a un amigo que se apellidaba igual h ctor m ndez n ez de zihuatanejo
2438134 y basada en la obra de stephen king rita hayworth amp shawshank redenction
2438135 porque entonces mis novelas no vend an gran cosa aunque fui entrevistado por algunos de tus compa eros gente muy simp tica aunque algo t mida recuerdo que hab an llenado una calle a la que llamaban real y que estaba en pleno centro de la ciudad con peque as placas adhesivas colocadas en el suelo y en las que se extra an algunos p rrafos de obras en las que se hac a referencia a la coru a me sorprendi aquel intento de acercar a la gente a la literatura porque no vi a nadie detenerse para mirar lo que hab an escrito en el suelo crees que sirve realmente para algo
2438136 pero es una forma de hacer creer que se apuesta por la cultura y a los pol ticos les va esa forma de autopromoci n
2438137 mi representante y el jefe de prensa local de la editorial me llevaron por la ciudad para que conociese algunos de los bares t picos sobre las diez acabamos en un local de las afueras del que me hab an contado maravillas se llamaba o faiado y cada jueves tocaba un grupo fue all donde compr mi primer sombrero

2438143 when i go out i like to wear very tight tops with no bra so my tits can bounce i like to look good so i wear something that will show my cleavage off i had a great time fucking xls stud he has one of the biggest cocks ive ever had you know a big girl like me appreciates a big dick for obvious reasons im passive so i need a guy who will tell me what to do and how to please him and your man did all that he showed me how to position myself to look my best while sucking and fucking his cock he told me that guys want to see a girls tits when she sucks cock porn sex isnt like regular sex where you orgasm at the same time i enjoyed being trained to be a dirty girl a plaything its just a fantasy ive had for a long time
2438144 if this happens then that might happen and then were all up the creek
2438145 weve said for a long time that a centralized network dvr is a better engineering solution than having hard drives all over everybodys home
2438146 if this particular court case is upheld we will deploy that
2438147 if you talk to a bunch of lawyers this is a lot more complicated than the headlines appear
2438148 it was a reminder of how bad they kicked our rear last year and that we needed to have good solid games against that team
2438149 we were up against a guy like jon lester who has tremendous movement on his pitches and mark buehrle was able to match him and give us a solid outing against a really tough lineup
2438150 it was just one of those things where wed given up the home run to pedroia and wed gotten hurt by a walk to j d drew and the last thing we needed was another walk
2438151 d j is a young pitcher and we just needed him to throw the ball over the plate walks really hurt us
2438152 it was a well played game it brings you to the next level when you play a game like that we need these types of games against a team like that
2438153 this is the mark we see most of the time when hes bad hes real bad but most of the time you know what youre going to get
2438154 its a challenge because the red sox come in here with a lot of their fans in the stands
2438155 im sure thats a huge factor for them in the end we have to take care of our own business thats a tough team tough lineup even without manny ram rez sure hes a first ballot hall of famer and hes no longer there but kevin youkilis j d drew jason bay these guys are having great years so theyre tough even without manny we just have to play good solid baseball to beat that team
2438156 hes a great player i think hes a very underrated player playing in that ballpark when i played there for two months i thought that if he played in a normal ballpark i would think hed be more successful but i dont know whats going on his head hes a good friend of mine and i wish him the best no matter what he decides
2438157 yeah of course you want to be in the thick of it its fun its fun being in the middle of this
2438158 hes got kids sure thats a consideration theyre going through some hard times in san diego but ive only text messaged him recently so we havent had any in depth discussions about it
2438159 there could be issues with playing time contract i really dont know it would seem like a great opportunity to play in a town like that but brian made his decision based on what he felt was right for him and his family
2438160 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2438161 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2438162 i worked pretty hard in the winter i didnt play really well in san diego it probably wasnt a great park for me to play in i gave it everything i had and i just couldnt get it done there i adjusted my swing and got back to my old ways and this park has helped me out a little bit
2438163 its just exciting to play on a good team in first place ive been blessed to play in the cities ive had a chance to play in like st louis and like chicago its just great to hear the fans so into it and the excitement of a pennant race
2438164 every day is like a playoff game here it does help your game when the games are more important ive always been able to calm myself down in big games and i guess that shows up sometimes
2438165 im like his mini me when hes out there i just get excited
2438166 since hes come over here hes been awesome you get a pitcher like that you want to give him everything youve got so you can make sure he gets the win hes doing his part

2438190 i agree that facts must be checked and analysis must be scrutinized but at the same time i do trust the work of the shankland wilcoxson llc group that has slaved away for nearly a decade now developing cornerstone theories in modern online gaming economy thinking
2438191 but not me and with the work of protzman saxby to guide us forward i think things will become a lot cleared in the online gaming economy community
2438192 i firmly believe that moving forward we must keep an optimistic view point and liberal stance in these online gaming economy matters if we lean back too much and stay conservative were going to remain in the dark ages forever and will not be able to continue to modernize our views i follow the comments of klas taccone and moselle schreyer from the second panel
2438193 i have nothing but respect for the work of arnoldi rodero in the online gaming economy field but we must proceed with caution and consider all ideas on the table if we blindly accept the work of a few thinkers without questioning the validity of their thought we are all wasting our time
2438194 the research from the valenzuela blackett inc group is ground breaking but at the same time solidifies a number of ideas that have been prolierated in the online gaming economy community now for years i for one am going to purchase the book attend the seminar and join in every conference discussion i can

2438198 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2438199 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2438200 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2438201 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2438202 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2438203 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2438204 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2438205 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2438206 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2438207 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2438208 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2438209 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2438210 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2438240 establishing order in areas that have been outside the control of government patrolling roads
2438241 georgian forces have played a key role partnering with the iraqi security forces to allow the iraqi people a chance to rebuild their lives and return to normalcy
2438242 we greatly appreciate the sacrifice and commitment of the georgian forces and their government in support of the coalition and the iraqi people
2438243 how to help the victims and the areas that have been badly affected by food crisis in chin state is the main agenda of the meeting
2438244 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2438245 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly

2438252 its been different in that i feel like a rookie all over again almost
2438253 its not something that im used to doing in my career but its something i accept and something i appreciate because it gives me another opportunity to show the coaches what i can do it gives me an opportunity to get better conditioning and an opportunity to learn the offense a lot better
2438254 the performance is important because im trying to make this ball club thats why i signed with the patriots
2438255 i wanted to come to a winning organization and get back to winning football and come somewhere where i felt like i had a chance to play and contribute
2438256 i survived a lot longer than i thought i would but i still have a ways to go
2438257 i dont feel like i was as explosive i dont feel like my footwork in the hole was as good as its been in the past conditioning wise i wasnt as bad as i thought i was going to be but im nowhere near where i would like to be
2438258 lamont did some real good things he had a lot of carries
2438259 i think there was some good teaching for him and he gained some good experience he showed up broke some tackles made some yards on his own and made a few plays it was good to see him out there and im sure hell get some more opportunities to build off those as we go forward
2438260 i wasnt as nervous as i thought i was going to be
2438261 i think this is a good spot for me to start to build on
2438262 my guess is that it will approach that in the nfl as well in time
2438263 whether it does right off the bat or not i dont know but it will take some type of extreme conditions or a very unusual situation to not do that if you win the toss
2438264 well defer just about every time unless there is some overriding circumstance that would cause us to do it differently so well start doing that now
2438265 hes a great player one of the best players in the last couple of decades he has just about every record you could have at the position he plays it speaks for itself
2438266 its always a big challenge playing the jets even more so now they have a lot of talent and im sure well have our hands full every time we face them but right now thats not at the forefront of our concerns we have a lot of other things before it would come to that and thats what well focus on but hes a great player there is no question about that
2438267 i just rushed up the field hard and the ball was right there so i stripped it and luckily i recovered it
2438268 im encouraged and glad they had the opportunity to play as much as they did i think it was a good experience for all those young linebackers

2438273 in principle those who want to leave leave and those who dont stay and pray that nothing terrible happens to them
2438274 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2438275 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2438276 we see panic rising among the population and the number of refugees trying to save their own lives and the lives of their children and families growing
2438277 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2438278 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2438279 i understand that the russian federation is a permanent member it is very hard to counter or oppose a permanent member in the security council but what i offer you is to have very solid statement to get to the government of the russian federation and as well the opposing parties that this kind of action should stop
2438280 the bombardment of the sovereign territory of georgia should stop and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2438281 pull back from the brink of a full fledged war

2438353 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2438354 lets put the past behind us and build the future that was a political issue and we took responsibility by paying compensation for the burning of the embassy
2438355 now we provide a guarantee to thai investors in order to make them more confident
2438356 yes investing in cambodia is risky and we knew that before we even decided to put our money in the country the first time around
2438357 all i want to say is if the country wants to see funds flow into the country it will have to avoid look at ways to avoid creating a situation where investors start to fear
2438358 the impact we have had is very minimal as the business size that we have there is very small and it is our firms policy to not invest too much in any single country that is new to us
2438359 i must say that we are used to these kinds of downturns as we have experienced them in burma too what we do is we wait and see how things shape up and then make a decision
2438360 they usually last for a short period and things go back to normal
2438361 yes there are risks and we knew it after the 2003 incident but cambodia is a market where everything is basically imported and how many markets in this part of the world can you find where there is such a huge potential
2438362 what we have to look at long term potential and overlook the short term issues
2438363 today despite all the perceived problems we are not experiencing anything there but then our project is not for mass consumption either and it would take years before we start to realise our returns
2438364 we are gathering here to pray to the souls of our ancestors asking for peace
2438365 we also pray for success in our defence of our territory
2438366 thai media reports said the mysterious black magic spells cast by khmer wizards would not only protect the temple but also weaken thailand some astrologers urged locals to wear yellow yesterday to deflect the spells
2438367 the anti government peoples alliance for democracy pad leaders last night led thousands of their supporters in a rival ritual to protect the country and block any ill effects from the cambodian one many thais believe some cambodians have expertise in black magic
2438368 to be accused of sorcery is regarded as a terrible insult by cambodians who regularly kill those accused of it
2438369 the only way is to oust the samak government and form a new government through whatever means or else the dispute over the preah vihear temple and thai cambodian border will never be solved
2438370 remember my words thai foreign minister tej bunnag will never be able to solve the dispute because the policy of this government is to betray the country
2438371 we cannot just carve out thailand to put in the sky or move our land away we will coexist for tens of thousands of years to come
2438372 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2438373 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2438374 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2438375 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2438376 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2438377 courtesy will go a long way because people dont get get it often everyone is free to be wrong only hold people to the level you can hold yourself lastly always do the right thing quit worrying about shit youve done its past so it doesnt matter just do the right thing keep that up and itll take you far

2438380 we dont have a daddy we had a sperm donar
2438381 we have located a number of sizable caches of insurgent weapons ied making supplies narcotics and money
2438382 the loss of these supplies is anticipated to significantly reduce insurgent capabilities in both kandahar and helmand provinces
2438383 we know that this area of maywand district is a theatre for other areas inside kandahar and inside helmand and we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we could actually cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other s
2438384 we know that we hemmed them in pretty well so anybody that couldnt escape the area has had to abandon their weapons to hide their weapons to try to blend in with the locals
2438385 they are actually starting to say you should maybe go and check out this particular area because there is some insurgents who are holed up and waiting for you to leave
2438386 hes wandering around looking like fifi hit paris in digby
2438387 this is like richard nixon and the dirty tricks department of donald segretti
2438388 i mean it makes no sense if the guy wanted to come into the room all he had to do is take off his secret squirrel outfit that kind of behaviour might work well in the bush world of reaganomics and republican politics but it doesnt work in canada
2438389 we are not going to sit in ottawa waiting to respond to trumped up attacks from liberal mps
2438390 i will let others judge the effectiveness or lack thereof of this approach
2438391 ageism seems to be the final frontier of acceptable discrimination imagine if mr
2438392 candidates nominated for a long time they are getting frantic
2438393 people have been on holding patterns for a year and a bit
2438394 this is a major hit and it reflects the total lack of comprehension of the government with regards to the role of arts and culture in representing the image of the country abroad
2438395 its not only athletes and businessmen who create the image of a country its also artists
2438396 it is more about having to trim spending i think like any canadian these days we have to make budget decisions and theyre not easy or pleasant ones
2438397 this is a gold medal performance in elitism and arrogance
2438398 i dont know what world the government and premier are living in but its not the world the people of this province are living in
2438399 first we had the 30 per cent mla pay increase then a variety of municipal pay increases and now huge senior level bureaucrat pay increases we are on a dangerous trajectory with no end in sight
2438400 there is room at the shelters our shelters run at about 90 per cent capacity
2438401 the issue is not really the shelter space it is whether the people will go into them or not
2438402 but if they cannot do that a tent city may be necessary
2438403 a place has to be provided where they can go people right now are stuck and need a place to stay
2438404 its not a long term solution but they have no other place to go
2438405 they decided to go back to the streets or back to the environment they had you do not have a 100 per cent success rate

2438437 thats why she really is a hero to all of us
2438438 i dont know if thats a genetic trait or not but i love to be challenged and thats exactly what this is
2438439 i would try to jump off a cliff if i had to go to an office and work 9 to 5 every day
2438440 she wasnt the best back court specialist to begin with and she just got better and better
2438441 i knew if she thought someone else could do it she could do it she took all of that to heart she was tenacious
2438442 ive learned so much about myself and changed so much during this process i keep pushing myself through volleyball to see where im going to go as a person

2438454 ich wusste schon vor dem zeittraining dass unsere abstimmung f r eine schnelle runde nicht optimal ist da wir konsequent an einem guten setup f r das rennen gearbeitet haben dennoch habe ich 110 prozent gegeben und war in der letzten kurve ein wenig zu schnell
2438455 unzufrieden bin ich deshalb nicht immerhin hat es trotz des kleinen ausrutschers noch zur drittschnellsten zeit in unserer klasse gereicht
2438456 heute hat man wieder einmal gesehen wie eng es in der alms zugeht ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir ein gutes auto f r das vierst ndige rennen morgen haben
2438457 und wer sascha und mich kennt der wei dass wir k mpfen werden
2438458 unser auto war nach einem umbau noch nicht optimal f r das qualifying
2438459 aber f r das rennen wird das ganz anders aussehen ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir um den sieg k mpfen k nnen

2438464 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2438465 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
2438466 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
2438467 it was so overwhelming not just to be here at the olympics but also to be playing emanuel and ricardo i just couldnt concentrate
2438468 i was worried i might be put off by the atmosphere but after the first few points i knew our preparation had paid off
2438469 the crowd was so passionate and they were cheering for both sides which was great beach volleyball is really growing in popularity here
2438470 esta noche te voy a cantar lo que siente mi alma por ti ven conmigo no te arrepentir s esta noche d jate llevar esta noche
2438471 our study provides compelling evidence that cancers hidden beneath the skin can be detected simply by dogs examining the odors of a persons breath
2438472 canine scent detection of cancer was something that was anecdotally discussed for decades but we felt it was appropriate to design a rigorous study that seriously investigated this topic to better evaluate its effectiveness
2438473 cancer cells emit different metabolic waste products than normal cells
2438474 the differences between these metabolic products are so great that they can be detected by a dogs keen sense of smell even in the early stages of disease
2438475 our biggest question right now is getting our life support systems working so we have enough for six person crew
2438476 right now were running kind of a water deficit and its being supplemented by the shuttle
2438477 by getting the crew quarters deployed well have extra bedrooms
2438478 that water is going to be used not just for drinking and food preparation but also for oxygen generation
2438479 and i think thats a key component of life support because i think were all addicted to breathing
2438480 the engineer and scientist in me say yeah its no problem
2438481 on the other hand its still kind of funny to know where that waters been its a good thing were a close crew
2438482 i heard squealing tires then boom saw the car flying off into the river
2438483 the first words out of his mouth were i was off to court to get a bench warrant lifted
2438484 it was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2438485 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2438486 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2438487 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2438488 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2438489 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2438490 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2438491 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2438492 its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2438493 incompatible with a civic vision of a dense walkable urban extension of philadelphia to the rivers edge
2438494 the next step includes a conversation with the casino folks about their locations and design issues
2438495 they are very large footprint buildings with large parking structures
2438496 the waterfront vision is about connectivity water access and urban amenities and theres a tension there
2438497 we wont be commenting on it today we havent read through it
2438498 we are in receipt of the report and will review accordingly
2438499 we have legitimate concerns and this report lays some of it out
2438500 these challenges lead to a conclusion that casinos of this program type do not work on these sites and by extension would be better sited elsewhere
2438501 anywhere but there how pathetic would that be going to my parents paper
2438502 so people who swim there should still be vigilant and operate under the assumption that there are no lifeguards on duty
2438503 the fact that the nra feels compelled to plant spies in organizations like ours borders on paranoia
2438504 it reminds me of the days when general motors spied on ralph nader when he was trying to make automobiles safer
2438505 by going ahead with construction youre basically cheating on the process
2438506 i got a couple of dogs and a granddaughter living with me now
2438507 i dont need no alligator i dont have a place for an alligator
2438508 faith was full of hope and full of the possibilities for the future
2438509 for some it will come sooner for others it will take time
2438510 we like the womens softball and basketball and the gymnastics
2438511 i have experience but the peak continues only on around 3rd
2438512 as the supreme court of new jersey has recognized for the executive branch to function effectively the chief executive must be free to receive consider and participate in candid communications
2438513 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2438514 that much of testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith need to be aired to the public and in the press
2438515 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2438516 with gods help and the prayers of many supporters we have and continue to endure it
2438517 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2438518 no alimony thats what im talking about its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2438519 ignored the publicity and grandstanding and focused on the facts
2438520 it was an ordinary case except for the two names on it
2438521 dealt with this as a couple splitting nothing more nothing less
2438522 not only is matos still capable of earning an income again after such a short marriage but the period during which the couple enjoyed an extremely high standard of living was inherently temporary
2438523 they would not have had personal assistants housekeeping managers groundskeepers and a residence provided them at no cost
2438524 it was apparent that he can rely on mark odonnell his partner to provide for him
2438525 he is underemployed because of his desire to return to school
2438526 during those four years hundreds of people who were privately experiencing the same pain reached out to me for support encouragement and guidance
2438527 in the future i will continue to help people who are victimized by those they once thought they could trust
2438528 now we will be getting started right away on negotiations for a new multiyear contract that has percentage wage increases and addresses the other contract proposals we made to the city that were not settled with this agreement
2438529 power and force of his position in a private setting when it may have consequences
2438530 he jumped off the atv or was thrown and runs from police
2438531 we catch up to him at the alley and he tries to go over the gate
2438532 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2438533 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2438534 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2438535 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2438536 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2438537 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2438538 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2438543 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
2438544 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
2438545 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
2438546 justice oconnor deemed the prayers at the council government speech and therefore determined that a requirement that prayers be nonsectarian not addressing any named deity is appropriate
2438547 by perverting the first amendment judges like oconnor prohibit something that the founders wanted to protect namely the freedom to pray according to your beliefs and sanction something the founders wanted to prohibit the government dictating how you can pray
2438548 the fourth circuit court of appeals today ruled that the city council of fredericksburg virginia had proper authority to require non sectarian prayer content and exclude council member rev hashmel turner from the prayer rotation because he prayed in jesus name
2438549 former supreme court justice sandra day oconnor writing the decision said
2438550 the restriction that prayers be nonsectarian in nature is designed to make the prayers accessible to people who come from a variety of backgrounds not to exclude or disparage a particular faith
2438551 gordon james klingenschmitt the former navy chaplain who faced court martial for praying in jesus name in uniform but won the victory in congress for other chaplains defended rev hashmel turner
2438552 the fredericksburg government violated everybodys rights by establishing a non sectarian religion and requiring all prayers conform or face punishment of exclusion

2438560 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2438561 a group of ten armed militants attacked a police checkpost in bunir and shot dead eight police officials deployed there
2438562 these militants came from swat valley to attack the post
2438563 our men attacked the checkpost and shot dead police officials
2438564 we will continue targeting all those police officials who are taking part in the ongoing military operation against us
2438565 over the years community shield matches have been between ourselves chelsea arsenal and liverpool
2438566 this is different it is good for portsmouth and shows the progress they have made
2438567 they are not easy to play against especially at their own ground and when you look at the progression in their team we know it will not be an easy game
2438568 harry brought peter crouch into his squad so you can see the direction of the partnership with defoe
2438569 those two will be a handful for anyone hopefully we can cope
2438570 the top four have enormous resources but over time it must be possible to compete with them
2438571 ive invested 250million in newcastle and so that and european nights of football must be the dream
2438572 we persisted so long because we were certain andy was the player we wanted
2438573 all transfer dealings these days particularly those involving a large sums of money do take time but i never had any doubts the transfer would be completed
2438574 any player that is at the age andy is and has played as many games as andy has is likely to have had some problems down the line
2438575 we wanted to get it right there was a lot of speculation but we reported early on we were trying to do a deal and maybe other clubs dont do that so i think thats what it was about
2438576 if someone feels unhappy about having to move down the pecking order of course well take that into consideration
2438577 fulham are a top team and have got a great gaffer and backroom staff and a great bunch of players
2438578 its where im from and fulham was my first choice so im happy to be here i was always confident the deal would happen
2438579 fulham were in a false position last year the gaffers brought in some top top players as well as the top players that were already here so we can do better than last year
2438580 i have a small family now and i think they settled better in london rather than up north
2438581 plus i think playing first team football was a factor behind the move
2438582 everton play with one up front home and away so you have four players fighting for one spot which is difficult
2438583 i only played a limited amount of games and when i did play i was up there on my own and could not get going
2438584 i have england ambitions playing week in and week out will help me get back into the england squad
2438585 england is still in the back of my mind i want to be in the squad and playing for fulham can only help that
2438586 i played for england when i was in the championship with crystal palace so i dont think being at fulham is a factor
2438587 we are fully aware of andys qualities and we will try to organise our team around that
2438588 his record of one in three goals in the premier league is a good record particularly by fulhams standards if he can do better than that well be delighted
2438589 im old fashioned to believe you need 11 players to work hard in your team and all four of the top teams have hard working players
2438590 i was not interested in signing a player whod be a liability to us when we did not have the ball
2438591 we want players who work had to get the ball and people like andy and bobby are team players
2438592 solitude is the furnace of transformation without solitude we remain victims of our society and continue to be entangled in the illusions of the false self
2438593 while consumers are using cell phones for mp3 players internet browsers tvs navigation devices and phones aoc determined that consumers deserved a display that would act as more than just an hd monitor or tv so we developed hd3 were very excited to be the first to bring hd3 technology to the market with the 2230fm aoc has taken over 40 years of display manufacturing experience to create this new way for consumers to enjoy a wide array of viceo options with a built in media player and top level performance regardless of whether its being used as an hd tv monitor or digital picture frame
2438594 wir m ssen eine zweite stufe einf hren damit nicht nur bei 30 prozent sondern erneut bei 50 prozent ein bernahmeangebot zwingend vorgelegt wird das schafft mehr transparenz und sicherheit f r alle leserbrief schreiben
2438595 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2438596 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2438597 wed love to get some money for the people who actually recorded this or perhaps even sir paul who knows
2438598 everybody knows were older than we were then but its just not important to have to go around wearing a little pin that has your age on it
2438599 when we first started if you were like over 25 that was it you know
2438600 you could accept jazz musicians in their 60s and 70s but you couldnt think of the beatles you know paul mccartney still doing it in his 60s or the stones the whole things completely changed
2438601 when you see some of the bands in there its a bit pathetic
2438602 everybody thought we were doing black magic and that crap onstage
2438603 i was saying the satanists were the politicians a lot of people misinterpreted that
2438604 everyone was sick of people coming on with flowers in their hair and peace man and all this crap
2438605 we were a different generation we rebelled against that because we knew it wasnt going to be peace man and all that
2438606 i think you have to use imagery thats going to sell your product
2438607 i dont think we ever set out to be dangerous we were just like musicians expressing what we were seeing around us
2438608 i mean raps completely different thats like theyre going around shooting people and raping women and dissing hos thats not what were about at all
2438609 were not here to espouse heroin use or crack use or anything like that because weve grown up and done all those other things and realized its very counterproductive for your lifespan of course and for your brain
2438610 but you know you gotta smoke a little pot thats part of life
2438611 it was different stuff then it was a different time
2438612 once we get one show under our belt ill feel better
2438613 touring is just very difficult especially when youd like to be home
2438614 weve done this all of our lives and after a while it just becomes very difficult to travel the physicality of it is very difficult at times but its such a joy to be able to play the music that it just washes away all that that hour and a half to two hours a night just makes it all worthwhile
2438615 theres still rock and roll but the sex and drugs
2438616 whats it like being a young boy stuck in an old mans body
2438617 making a record now is more a means to give people a taste of what theyll get if they come see me live
2438618 where before playing live was more to give people a taste of what theyd get if they bought your record its probably turned right around
2438619 yeah weve built up a bit of a repertoire now
2438620 a good few hours of stuff its good though we can make a very strong hour set
2438621 in england and europe im known as much for playing guitar as organ because on the early hits i had over there which werent hits here i was playing guitar
2438622 being a jack of all trades might work against me i suppose i get forgotten sometimes
2438623 i suppose i shouldnt undersell myself ive been very lucky
2438624 i do try i think in rock n roll at the moment lately it can be very dark i try and lift peoples spirits rather than dampen them
2438625 esa canci n es justamente la que me hace vivir emociones o recordar cosas
2438626 its about commitment to the future we have a loyal band of fans and they need to know we are committed and planning ahead
2438627 swinton are a very big set and last week will have given them a lot of confidence they have picked up mike wainwright they have martin moana wayne english is back so they are going to be a handful
2438628 its about us now making sure we progress and keep doing the little things right a win will probably seal a play off place for us which is another big bonus its something we will address in training and make sure our heads are screwed on all right and be ready for the job on sunday
2438629 we had a tough week last week but i gave the players four days off and those who have been carrying knocks have had rehab i think we are on top of everything i think the only doubt will be ian sinfield who has a tight hamstring well have a look at him and see how we go
2438630 it was certainly a relief it takes some doing to come out of a seven game run like that and im very pleased for the players
2438631 weve now got an opportunity to go and enjoy ourselves for the last three weeks
2438632 its a fabulous opportunity for the lads and everyone in whitworth little old spartans playing an international side not many players get the chance to travel abroad to play and it would be a great honour for spartans to represent their country i just hope we can get a sponsor to allow this to go ahead
2438633 we are very pleased to see that more children and young people are in school this represents a lot of good work by staff in schools by the education welfare service and by parents
2438634 as part of this we have issued penalty notices and taken more court actions where there have been individual long standing problems
2438635 i have a client who is buying a property for 200k but it is appraised for 350k can you do a 200k ltv is only 57
2438636 schools dont play rugby as it is regarded as a barbaric sport which i found amusing as ice hockey which isnt the gentlest of sports is very popular
2438637 training sessions were held on heated pitches surrounded by six foot snow drifts i even managed to get to visit an olympic venue to watch snowboarding and ski ing after one of the rugby players said i was a member of the fijian bobsleigh team
2438638 we want to keep the best and brightest in rochdale as well as attracting students from across the country
2438639 no timescales are in place but we are looking at a five year project at least this has to be right for the future of students in rochdale
2438640 we are still in the early stages but we are looking to work with one of the manchester universities
2438641 we are very hopeful because there is a real opportunity under the university challenge scheme
2438642 if you went back 15 years the matron was on the ward and cleaners were employed by the hospital and there seemed to be a lot of pride on the ward
2438643 contracts then went out to the private sector and cleaners are now earning the minimum wage
2438644 they are not being encouraged or motivated to take their jobs seriously theres a high turnover of staff and that needs to be examined
2438645 we carry out regular environment inspections on all our hospital sites to identify potential problem areas and we take pest control and eradication very seriously
2438646 the systems we have in place are designed to identify and then deal with any issues we do not have a pest problem and indeed the aggressive approach we take whenever concerns are raised prevents this
2438647 we actively encourage our staff to report any issues directly to our specialist contractors who investigate and carry out follow up checks
2438648 these figures are a serious cause for concern and its crucial that standards of cleanliness are at the highest possible levels
2438649 these figures show that currently this is not the case and i will be calling on the health minister ivan lewis to order an inquiry
2438650 the governments strategy for delivering clean safe care is working
2438651 nhs bodies are required to have a pest control policy and it is simply good practice for pest controllers to make routine visits but there is no evidence that pests are spreading healthcare associated infections
2438652 we are extremely disappointed and think that a huge mistake has been made
2438653 the community needs these vital services and with lowerplace post office being currently closed i am very worried that customers will have to travel more than a mile to their nearest branch
2438654 im happy that spotland road has been saved but all the branches should have been saved the community has been let down
2438655 i am devastated for the post offices that face closure i hope that our unique plan to save the branches will mean a lifeline for the threatened branches
2438656 i am pleased for the team at spotland road but feel for the others it is my view that the consultation team have ignored the arguments we set out
2438657 for all intents and purposes many of the decisions that the team made were a sham they had already made their minds up
2438658 i am delighted this popular post office will remain serving the people of rochdale for the foreseeable future
2438659 i am sorry that many others are not so fortunate and their post office faces an uncertain future i know that the council is working hard to find a way to save them

2438685 wir rufen russland auf die luftwaffen und raketenschl ge gegen georgien einzustellen die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu respektieren und seine verb nde vom territorium georgiens abzuziehen
2438686 ranghohe us offizielle und ich haben mit beiden seiten gesprochen und arbeiten mit diesen weiter um den kampfhandlungen ein ende zu setzen die usa arbeiten aktiv auch mit ihren europ ischen partnern daran eine internationale vermittlung zu initiieren wir bitten russland uns bei diesen anstrengungen dringend zu unterst tzen
2438687 wir betonen die unterst tzung der internationalen v lkergemeinschaft f r die souver nit t und die territoriale integrit t georgiens innerhalb der international anerkannten grenzen was in zahlreichen resolutionen des un sicherheitsrates einschlie lich der j ngsten resolution 1808 vom april 2008 verankert ist

2438692 einem chauffeur der in seinem bereitschaftsraum darauf wartet dass er gerufen wird kann man ganz sicher nicht unterstellen dass er durch fernsehen seine arbeit vernachl ssigt
2438693 schlie lich sollen sie nach dieser ruhezeit auch noch arbeitsleistungen verrichten
2438694 auch eine verk uferin in einer boutique wird einmal keine kunden haben doch k nnte es f r das gesch ft betriebswirtschaftlich sch digend sein wenn sie l mmelnd in der ecke vorm tv sitzt
2438695 bei all diesen fragen befinden wir uns in einem wechselspiel zwischen grenzen der auslebung der freien pers nlichkeit der arbeitnehmer und den rechten des arbeitgebers
2438696 solange keine kunden oder andere arbeitnehmer gest rt werden hat der arbeitgeber kein recht derart schikan se methoden anzuwenden
2438697 we were able to determine that the aircraft came into the trees next to the river at a very steep angle
2438698 on examination of the wreckage its damage is consistent with the aircraft not being in control just before impact
2438699 we know there was a mechanical problem because of the loss of control but it was not a problem thats associated with ongoing maintenance or design
2438700 the aircraft was damaged by equipment thats not normally on the aircraft when its in flight
2438701 well likely get a propeller expert to join us in the disassembly of the propeller hubs and from there well determine whether we need to go into the engines
2438702 in my failure to perform my public duty i have brought shame and disgrace to myself and my loved ones
2438703 i am prepared to pay my debt to the community
2438704 a bizarre and situationally driven form of self destructive behaviour
2438705 he indicated he was in toronto the police have not advised me the details of the negotiations
2438706 im sure you know thats why hes trying to negotiate he is facing extradition and a six year sentence and additional sentence in respect to these new charges
2438707 i dont expect that i will be asking for the maximum sentence but i will be asking for a substantial sentence
2438708 we cant really talk about anything that were doing with this file
2438709 i have no idea why mr tahvili is negotiating now
2438710 its ongoing were still following up leads and its a sensitive investigation and there isnt anything at this time that we can say publicly about it having said that were still asking for help from the public in order to locate him
2438711 were not in a position to make public what information we have
2438712 viable and important source of affordable housing throughout the province
2438713 one bedroom units in kelowna and im talking about basement suites are going for 850 a month and so 20 000 doesnt go very far
2438714 we have situations where landlords are trying to do bogus evictions
2438715 the right of first refusal would just cut off that kind of eviction at the knees
2438716 it could not have been the intent of the legislature to provide such a
2438717 im not willing to give up rental housing in the downtown
2438718 it removes the mix of incomes and really starts us on the road to gentrifying the downtown
2438719 its a grey area where the landlords arent taking care of the buildings but is a crappy building better than the street
2438720 your landlord writes you and says im the new owner i get to increase the rent and you dont know the law youve signed the thing and youre hooped
2438721 if you have a congested corridor like this and the signals are not coordinated its nuts
2438722 essentially its like walking down a hall and somebody opening a door here there and everywhere especially if you cant do any other kind of improvements like were not going to be able to widen this part of highway 9 any more you start looking outside the box
2438723 a queue of traffic will be able to move in what we call a free flow down highway 9
2438724 the signals will be able to communicate with each other so as a platoon of cars is moving down highway 9 the signals would keep on changing
2438725 i think the people of boiling springs will be anxious to see this come

2438727 what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition

2438729 to put it out as news just two days after the lambeth conference appears to be trying to scupper the whole lambeth process we are insisting that the lambeth process was a good process and we do not want it to be damaged

2438731 he is not currently receiving any medication or antibiotics but should be
2438732 he cannot afford this surgery or even pay for the surgeries he has already had
2438733 we currently have 32 personnel with injuries that we are not able to treat in military facilities
2438734 the soldiers are forced to go to civilian medical clinics and pay out of pocket
2438735 they perform their duties selflessly and dont worry about themselves
2438736 after issues like this arise though they always look back to coalition forces for help
2438737 the isf continue to come to us with their hands out but are slowly beginning to realize their own ability to solve problems
2438738 the ia patrols are now taking medics with them to provide immediate care if somebody is injured
2438739 this is a new practice they have adopted in the last nine months under u s advice
2438740 the iraqi armys medical care is not as thorough as what we are accustomed to in the u s military this is why they are forced to go to civilian health care facilities when wounded on duty
2438741 engineers provide our force with a flexibility to accomplish tasks spanning the full array of lethal and non lethal options in a counterinsurgency fight trained and equipped to execute independently or in concert with maneuver forces engineers often find themselves accomplishing their engineer tasks while providing their own security
2438742 it is incredible to see the progress made every day by iraqi citizens in their efforts to better their lives its something the news back home never reports on every day we see new schools soccer fields and parks being finished
2438743 the earth movers have always been a close platoon and this mission has made us even stronger we are developing that unique bond created during combat often described as becoming family each soldier can tell how the other one thinks and acts its our camaraderie and dedication to excellence that made it easy to transition to this mission

2438748 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2438749 i get nervous because its game time you can get as much as you put in
2438750 i think people would look at this and say wow an indian film exotic location it looks really interesting why dont we go see what this is about and then you find its about you
2438751 i think when youre in a place that does seem exotic youre willing to suspend your disbelief a bit more
2438752 one guy e mailed me right after the san francisco festival and said that based on feelings the movie evoked he went home and proposed to his girlfriend
2438753 i said to richie at the first couple of events last year this is weird were actually allowed to be here but now we have this go get it type of attitude and nothing can stop that
2438754 the idea was we want to appeal to the art house crowd but also the indian suburban crowd
2438755 obviously itd be nice to make money but the goal is sustainability
2438756 i got to make the movie i wanted to make
2438757 growing up i loved movies more than anything i wanted to be a moviemaker i just didnt know how to do it
2438758 i wouldnt say yes to every city that would call because youre committing yourself to writing a script that works in the city and living there for three months or something
2438759 but wed been to barcelona several times and my wife loves it and its a great place for the kids its right on the water
2438760 when i finish a film and im in the room at home and ive got to think of another film
2438761 then i got a call from penelope cruz who i didnt know from a hole in the wall she said i understand youre making a film in barcelona and i would like to participate so great that was a good start i wanted to have some spanish people in it otherwise just to put an american film in barcelona is nothing
2438762 they want to find me in it they want to find whats autobiographical in my movies they always fall into the fallacy of that movie was funny were you in a good mood in your private life then or that movie was sad were you in a dark place personally but going back when i made take the money and run and bananas this was not a happy time of my life at all whereas when i made cassandras dream and match point it was one of the best times of my life i was completely happy but people need with many filmmakers but certainly with me to a great deal to find a correlation with my mood in the film and the characters
2438763 i know who you are youre the angel who made me go back
2438764 is there a single person on whom i can press belief no sir all i can do is say heres how it went heres what i saw ive been there and am going back make of it what you will
2438765 those who maintain that article 140 of the iraqi constitution is dead are instigating public unrest
2438766 i was in the dining room doing paperwork and having a cigarette
2438767 it was closed as a hotel at the time and was therefore my private home there were no guests i only had a friend staying
2438768 the officer came across as vicious and a person with attitude
2438769 the defendant returned from the kitchen with a cigarette which she continued to smoke in the bar area she confirmed it was a smoke free hotel but said it was her home and she was free to smoke
2438770 the officer said smoking in her quarters was ok but not in the bar
2438771 seeing the people that need help there are a lot of children in vietnam and the different places that we give chairs to they get a smile most of them do
2438772 some children crawl on their bellies to get to the place where the wheelchairs are going to be handed out
2438773 the reports that come back say that they are very appreciative
2438774 the good lord promotes it to my way of thinking
2438775 im going to miss him i hated to lose him he was an excellent attorney
2438776 he adapted well to every position he was placed in and successfully transitioned from misdemeanor to felony without any problems
2438777 comes with a wealth of experience including an interest in taking a hard look at domestic violence cases and reviewing how theyre handled and her acumen in charging decisions comes from her experience in municipal and felony cases
2438778 i believe that she has an excellent reputation with law enforcement
2438779 from the time i was 12 i wanted to be an attorney and help people i hope i do that
2438780 im looking forward to working with law enforcement again and to the excitement of working on a case and having the pieces come together and the confidence to go into trial
2438781 overall im very proud of the staff i have now it is one of the most collectively experienced staffs i had in my career as prosecutor
2438782 its nice to get respect like that but polls dont mean much
2438783 id much rather be ranked high at the end of the year
2438784 we werent accustomed to being where we were last year after four games
2438785 we were pretty fragile to our guys credit i think they really did a great job of bouncing back
2438786 we felt like we got a whole lot better as the season went on our expectations are high and were certainly not happy about what happened last year
2438787 sheppard is as healthy as hes ever been after battling injuries the last few years and holter really started getting more and more comfortable last year as a first year starter
2438788 we have a lot back from last years club and thats exciting
2438789 well strive to be balanced on offense and be great tacklers on defense
2438790 most of the other coaches in the league probably know our strengths and weaknesses better than i do at this point because i havent been able to spend a lot of time coaching the team yet
2438791 i think im at an advantage to take over a good program coach creighton and his staff did a great job and i just want to build on what theyve done
2438792 so other people dont go through what shes going through
2438793 we will defend the boards decision and we will be defending the statute as constitutional
2438794 we took zimmerlys deposition only because he is another candidate running for sheriff in november
2438795 the question is what about other candidates are candidates being treated equally in how the requirements for what is full time for a peace officer is applied
2438796 i would like to thank all the track staff race fans drivers sponsors the local community and everyone who made it possible for hilltop to make it this far and put on so many spectacular races
2438797 every day until she brings us back until the speaker brings us back every day
2438798 you cant thwart the will of the american people our system of government doesnt allow it
2438799 one person cant stand up and just block the will of the american people she may be trying to protest harry reid and barack obama but the speaker is gonna get rolled the only question is when and you can take that to the bank
2438800 cultures of the now infamous ames strain of bacillus anthracis
2438801 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2438802 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2438803 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2438804 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2438805 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2438806 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2438807 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2438808 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2438809 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2438810 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2438811 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2438812 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2438813 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2438814 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2438815 i woke up for morning prayers on 4 march and there was gunfire everywhere we were very frightened so we stayed in the house and hoped it would stop but then in the early afternoon my brothers children came running to our house screaming and crying they told us the forc s arm es centrafricanes faca the army trained and equipped by the french on behalf of their friendly neighbourhood strongman president fran ois bozize had gone into their house they wouldnt calm down and explain so i ran there and i saw my brother on the floor outside dead his wife explained they had forced their way in and rounded him up along with three men who lived nearby they took them out on to the street and shot them one by one in the head
2438816 we could see the villages burning and the children were screaming and really scared so we ran two kilometres out into the jungle from there we could see our whole city on fire we fled along the river and stayed out there we ate fish but there werent many some days we couldnt catch anything and we starved the children were so terrified still when they hear a loud noise they think there are guns coming and they start shaking
2438817 on the fourth day we saw the french planes come they each had six rockets that they fired the explosions were loud we dont know what they were targeting or why then the french soldiers arrived
2438818 when it rains we are cut off from the world because the roads turn to mud we have nothing all the rebels were asking was for government help
2438819 hes been sick for a long time we tried to get him to a nurse but there arent any we think it is malaria but there is no medicine here we dont know what will happen we are all weak and feverish were exhausted because we work all day every day i have not eaten for days now
2438820 i watched my parents forced to work in the fields when i was a child
2438821 when they got tired they were whipped and beaten and made to go faster it was constantly like this
2438822 it is common to meet long files of prisoners naked and in a pitiful state being dragged along by a rope round their necks they are famished sick and fall down like flies the really ill and the little children are left in the villages to die of starvation the people least affected often killed the dying for food
2438823 a troglodyte subsisting wretchedly on roots until he starves to death rather than accept these terrible burdens
2438824 only a few months ago been rich populous and firmly established in large villages
2438825 nothing happens in this country without somebody pulling a lever in paris
2438826 they tried to kill my son they are trying to assassinate me
2438827 we have been described by the magazine foreign policy as one of the worst failed states in the world after iraq and afghanistan
2438828 local people in these regions are rebelling against the government because the government provides them with nothing there are no services there arent even roads so the rebels rise up to get attention and the government retaliates by rampaging through the area killing civillians and burning homes
2438829 call me back i am running out of credit on my mobile phone
2438830 in jail you were given rotten fish to eat i got gout the toilets
2438831 it is very likely somebody from the presidential clan will kill me every morning when i wake up i think there are three beds i could end up in tonight back here at home the hospital or the morgue
2438832 i will not be afraid it is when you are afraid that you lose
2438833 it was through watching him that bozize got his taste for power
2438834 they pissed in his mouth they broke his ribs they really mistreated him for three years
2438835 the presidents are selected by france not elected by the people the presidents do not serve the interests of this country they serve the interests of france
2438836 the country will only be able to develop when france stops putting in place these dictators and the people choose
2438837 the car will only progress when the president is scared of his people not the french
2438838 there have been a few undisciplined elements but we have dealt with them
2438839 i had an officer who went to the market when he was not supposed to i disciplined him
2438840 show me the villages i will show you how we have done good
2438841 the policies here in the car are part of a much bigger approach by france towards africa
2438842 we call this system franceafrique and it was set up by charles de gaulle to replace the former colonial system there is clear continuity from the imperial system to the present day
2438843 the overarching goal is to take african resources and funnel them towards french corporations
2438844 the car itself is a base from which the french can access resources all over africa that is why it is so important they use it to keep the oil flowing to french companies in chad the resources flowing from congo and so on and of course the country itself has valuable resources car has a lot of uranium which the french badly need because they are so dependent on nuclear power at the moment they get their uranium from niger but the car is their back up plan
2438845 yes but also a lot of this money has been funnelled through corruption straight back into the french political process say somebody needs a road built here in the car the french government will insist on a french company and the french company back home donates a lot to the right french political party
2438846 the french were totally complicit in the genocide there were french troops there before during and after the genocide backing the most extreme hutu forces as they murdered the tutsis you know the identity cards that divided the rwandan population into hutus and tutsis in preparation for the slaughter they were printed in paris
2438847 and the french government deliberately destroyed any attempt at a peace deal
2438848 even at this point mitterrands real aim was to recapture kigali and restore the hutus to power
2438849 children would bring us the severed heads of their parents and scream for help
2438850 if he wants the french to crush his rebellions and keep him in power he has to do what they say
2438851 the kind of dog that leads you which we have had in the past
2438852 bozize is burning our villages a country shouldnt burn its own countrys villages it is like a mother and a child a mother does not burn her child it would be madness
2438853 france is the mother of central africa and we are the child
2438854 the french must now change sides and support us not bozize the french are our parents we want them to be good parents
2438855 o universo n o foi feito medida do ser humano mas t o pouco lhe adverso lhe indiferente

2438860 si les parents nous font trop chier on se tirera hein
2438861 me dites pas que vous lavez jamais fait a je vous croirais pas
2438862 we have russian tanks moving in we have continuous russian bombardment
2438863 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2438864 its like the attack into afghanistan in 1979 its like czechoslovakia when the soviet tanks rolled in if they get away with this in georgia the world will be in trouble
2438865 o melhor carnaval brasileiro continua sendo o do rio a bahia faz o melhor carnaval africano
2438866 aquele que luta com monstros deve acautelar se para n o tornar se tamb m um monstro quando se olha muito tempo para um abismo o abismo olha para voc

2438869 sempre que te perguntarem se podes fazer um trabalho responde que sim e te ponhas em seguida a aprender como se faz
2438870 a felicidade o subproduto do esfor o de fazer o pr ximo feliz
2438871 quando nasci fiquei t o surpresa que n o falei durante ano e meio
2438872 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2438873 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2438874 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2438875 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2438876 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2438877 were all born somewhere on that continuum but all the training in the world can only move you a little bit
2438878 nutrition is key in anybodys life whether were professional athletes or working at a desk
2438879 people stress about the calorie content of protein but they should be stressing about sugar
2438880 you want to keep your body running so efficiently that everything youre using is converted to energy and your body doesnt store anything
2438881 if your clothes fit great and you like the way you look in the mirror does it matter what the scale says
2438882 its like age you could be 45 but feel 30 age and weight are just numbers that we get obsessed with but they dont mean were healthy
2438883 the more intense the training is the more youre going to reach your potential
2438884 you will not find an olympic athlete who is not highly highly trained they dont roll out of bed and win the 100 meter sprint or the 50 freestyle they spend hours and hours of training of all sorts
2438885 people are hesitant at the beginning to spend the money with a personal trainer but after a month when theyre tightening their waistband and their shorts are loose they really see the results
2438886 after a while you adjust to the expense and it becomes part of your lifestyle
2438887 we might all be better off if we used less salt and pepper and focused more on herbs and spices
2438888 ive started putting oregano in my eggs thats not a big change
2438889 at first we thought it was the apples but it soon became clear that it was the cinnamon
2438890 taking cinnamon supplements for the purposes of either improving glucose control or improving cholesterol levels is not supported by the evidence that is currently available
2438891 larger studies may show that supplementation is beneficial but it seems unlikely
2438892 we showed that herbs and spices are powerful sources of antioxidants and anti inflammatory agents
2438893 about a teaspoon of cinnamon for example is plenty to get these beneficial effects
2438894 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the calorie content
2438895 it is an opportunity for the companies to continue to put products on the market without a pre market evaluation by the fda
2438896 here was our concern lets say i launch a product today thats a straight up the gut traditional cigarette
2438897 the big fear was you go out there and the fda comes out with regulations and says oh thats not a registered product
2438898 what we found is that neither of these popular and commonly used treatments offered a higher birth rate than no treatment at all
2438899 what weve shown is that neither of these first line treatments is better than the couples trying themselves
2438900 although it may seem a bit counterintuitive this is the one area of medicine where doing nothing could be as effective as going for any of these treatments
2438901 in the u s generally higher doses of clomid are used typically 100 milligrams a day
2438902 if anything the take home point from this study is in the group where they did insemination alone without any fertility drug there wasnt a significant increase in pregnancy
2438903 just doing insemination alone is probably not going to really increase a persons chance of pregnancy
2438904 if you have a patient with good results on the ovarian reserve testing then expectant management no treatment might be something the patient might desire
2438905 in the united states the indication of unexplained infertility is definitely managed more aggressively than it was in this study
2438906 usually after a year of trying and not succeeding the last thing a couple wants to hear is go home and try again
2438907 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2438908 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2438909 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2438910 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2438911 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2438912 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
2438913 and they had her cover the one eye and she did just fine and then when they covered the other eye it was shocking i think anytime that you find something is wrong or not normal its devastating
2438914 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
2438915 shes gotta live with the decision that her mom and dad made for her when she was seven years old
2438916 and were just hoping that weve made the right decision that this is something that will be a long term benefit for her
2438917 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
2438918 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
2438919 since it was first identified in new york city almost a decade ago
2438920 theres been a steady westward migration of this west nile virus
2438921 apparently this is may be a sign of the times there has been as more and more homes are passing into foreclosure and many of those homes have backyard pools these are being neglected theyre not being maintained this can become a ripe feeding ground and breeding ground for these mosquito populations
2438922 viruses are infinitely adaptable and they the tougher types may be pushing out the weaker strains but whats of great concern to the california officials specifically is that historically the more virulent strains have been causing a very small percentage of the cases but more recently in this year of the cases that have been identified 70 percent are caused by this more virulent more aggressive strain and this is the one that actually invades the brain and spinal cord the central nervous system
2438923 clearly if you just have the viral symptoms as many of us have the symptoms of the west nile virus in approximately 20 percent of cases are just like any other viral illness the nausea vomiting fever chills rashes those dont need to be treated
2438924 but when you become disoriented or you notice your friend or family is becoming disoriented having severe muscle weakness fatigue even paralysis in the more severe cases obviously before these signs come about you need to seek medical care
2438925 i am aware of it when i am driving i am aware of it when i am playing with my kids
2438926 the patient loves that because it really takes tremendous pressure off their shoulders
2438927 theyve never approached us to warn us of anomalies of that nature
2438928 much more if is men public figures with such important positions
2438929 its regrettable that this occurs our men and women gamble their lives every day confronting narcotics traffickers despite that one or two agents sometimes fall into temptation but to say the dncd serves drug trafficking is irresponsible
2438930 because when we uncover something when we suspected an agent accepts money from someone they are dismissed on the spot and even brought up on charges
2438931 the way were going to improve this situation is by education not only in latin america but here
2438932 when we build the academies we have to continue to invest in education
2438933 she is not entitled to a lifestyle commensurate with that of the first lady of new jersey
2438934 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2438935 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2438936 as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2438937 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2438938 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2438939 why i bought the sunshine kids radian 80 car seats for my kids
2438940 we put a pretty good emphasis on it for the first two to four weeks of the summer
2438941 its assaulting the eardrums and most of it is offensive
2438942 your windows literally rock i want to shut the car off and go over but thats the kind of thing that will get somebody jammed up
2438943 i guess people understand the dollar id like larger fines right off the top and the ability to remove the equipment from the car
2438944 de situatie op de kredietmarkten overschaduwt de resultaten en het feit dat dit bedrijf goed draait
2438945 we hopen dat de afdeling in nederland eerder kan overgaan maar dit hangt vooral af van de automatisering
2438946 rbs heeft met de onderdelen van abn een veel betere spreiding van risico en inkomsten
2438947 musici willen communiceren dat kan wat mij betreft nooit kleurrijk eerlijk ontroerend en extreem genoeg zijn
2438948 het stift festival genoemd naar de abdij waarin we spelen is een combinatie van kamermuziekconcerten en masterclasses
2438949 in het concertgebouw val ik vaak in slaap omdat er bijna geen momenten meer zijn van totale muzikale overgave die hoor je nog wel in het spel van de vioolvirtuozen uit het verleden je hebt natuurlijk slechte oude violisten en goede nieuwe maar in het algemeen werd er in de vorige eeuw beter muziek gemaakt
2438950 hij heeft in de jaren zeventig geweldige opnames gemaakt van bartok chausson sjostakovitsj en tsjaikovski zijn vulkanische temperament vind ik een grote inspiratiebron
2438951 ik wilde hem zijn geheim ontfutselen maar hij had het vooral over streek vingerzettingen en langzaam studeren
2438952 voor hem is de stok een middel voor het bereiken van een eindeloos kleurenpalet van het heeste gefluister tot de helderste klanken gitlis stamt nog uit de tijd dat musici grote persoonlijkheden waren hij is iemand die ramen open kan zetten die anders gesloten blijven
2438953 voor mij is het stift een gewijde plek kort na mijn geboorte zijn we op stift 23 komen wonen mijn ouders zijn in het kerkje getrouwd ik heb er mijn eerste concerten gespeeld en mijn vader david rowland die componist was ligt er begraven hij schreef zijn leven lang avant gardemuziek zijn oeuvre is indringend nooit zoetsappig tijdens het vorige stift festival speelde hij voor de laatste keer piano
2438954 maar het vervelende is dat de muziek van bach vivaldi en piazolla beter verkoopt dan sch nberg en berg
2438955 van ver zijn onze vrienden gekomen hoe gelukkig zijn wij
2438956 wij de mensen van ping an zijn in iedere hoek van het land hand in hand met ons hele hart werken wij voor een veilig china en een groot ping an
2438957 klinkt het in de duizenden kantoren en kantoortjes van het tweede verzekeringsconcern van china
2438958 onze investering in fortis is een langetermijninvestering we volgen natuurlijk de turbulenties in de financi le industrie en er heeft zich een grote aanpassing van de aandelenprijs voorgedaan maar we zijn ervan overtuigd dat de financi le status van fortis stabiel is
2438959 ping an wil niet alleen meer een verzekeraar zijn maar ook vermogensbeheerder en bank oprichter ma heeft eens gezegd dat hij de citigroup van china wil worden gezien de financi le positie van ping an zal hem dat lukken ook hoewel chinese beleggers en analisten vragen stellen over de wijsheid om in fortis te stappen
2438960 zelfs zijn jaarsalaris van 66 miljoen yuan 5 3 miljoen euro red is openbaar
2438961 de klantenbasis van ping an is nu 40 miljoen terwijl al 200 miljoen chinezen tot de middenklasse gerekend kunnen worden er wordt bovendien zeer strategisch gedacht in shenzhen
2438962 leerde confucius ons niet dat als de rijken vermageren het de armen zijn die van de honger omkomen
2438963 there have been claims in various published technical articles and newsgroup postings that windows xp always reserves 20 percent of the available bandwidth for qos these claims are incorrect one hundred percent of the network bandwidth is available to be shared by all programs unless a program specifically requests priority bandwidth
2438964 within the first year i lived there four houses a combination of victorian colonial revival and craftsman were moved into french park
2438965 there was one guy who came back four or five times
2438966 he just wanted to look at the artistry of how the home was designed and built
2438967 its a tucked away neighborhood that not everyone knows about
2438968 in most cases owners want to bring the home back to its original glory
2438969 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2438970 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2438971 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2438972 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2438973 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2438974 zeker toen arsenal een tandje bijzette dit team is verder in de voorbereiding dan wij maar in de eerste helft heeft ajax mij aangenaam verrast
2438975 ik wacht rustig af anderen moeten zich binnen de club maar met deze kwestie bezighouden
2438976 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2438977 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2438978 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2438979 une commission denqu te militaire a t mise en place et tous ceux qui sont impliqu s dans cette tentative de coup detat sont interrog s afin de faire la lumi re sur cette affaire
2438980 some members of the dup have alluded to the fact that they want rid of partnership government
2438981 that they want to get back to some form of majority rule but thats not going to happen
2438982 we either make progress as it is at the moment or the two governments have to take up their responsibilities and make progress by other means
2438983 franchisen afh nger egentlig af om jeg finder p en god id

2438985 the new elite philanthropists are more likely to give globally and to social sector causes and leaders drawn from disadvantaged communities
2438986 a n astonishing statement for which i can find no evidence at all
2438987 the researchers note that the simulation does not model any forms of normal matter such as stars or planets
2438988 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2438989 that much of testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith need to be aired to the public and in the press
2438990 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2438991 with gods help and the prayers of many supporters we have and continue to endure it
2438992 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2438993 no alimony thats what im talking about its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2438994 ignored the publicity and grandstanding and focused on the facts
2438995 it was an ordinary case except for the two names on it
2438996 dealt with this as a couple splitting nothing more nothing less
2438997 not only is matos still capable of earning an income again after such a short marriage but the period during which the couple enjoyed an extremely high standard of living was inherently temporary
2438998 they would not have had personal assistants housekeeping managers groundskeepers and a residence provided them at no cost
2438999 it was apparent that he can rely on mark odonnell his partner to provide for him
2439000 he is underemployed because of his desire to return to school
2439001 during those four years hundreds of people who were privately experiencing the same pain reached out to me for support encouragement and guidance
2439002 in the future i will continue to help people who are victimized by those they once thought they could trust
2439003 no one wants to see a closed historic theater on chestnut street
2439004 this is a building built in the new art deco style before construction had even started on the chrysler building
2439005 for a long time china dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2439006 however the actual event exceeded all my expectations this was an unprecedented and grand success
2439007 there will be a lot of people pulling for you
2439008 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot and i know youre excited about marching into the stadium representing our country so i guess all we have to say is go for it give it all youve got and god bless you
2439009 i have been to many games and many opening ceremonies
2439010 but this is by far by far the most sensational of them all bodes well for the rest of the games doesnt it mate
2439011 right now its comfortable for the dealers this is the first time all year its been that way
2439012 i would tell you that most margins today are in the 20 plus range
2439013 retail margins are as good as any retail margins weve seen since probably the third quarter of 2006 so very very strong
2439014 this is the first time in a while were seeing some profits in the end instead of breaking even
2439015 this is a very hard place to sail and consistency is going to be the key to a good results
2439016 the racing is going to be very exciting to watch
2439017 on a personal note it is the most important development in the 30 years i have been caring for these patients

2439218 the overuse of toxic drugs another thing to watch out for if you have to visit an eye doctor is the use of dangerous drugs to dilate the pupil
2439219 now ask yourself who has a vested interest in preventing myopia the doctors the big optical manufacturing companies the schools the government the fact of the matter is that no one has a financial interest in preventing myopia except the unfortunate person who suffers from it

2439351 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2439352 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2439353 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2439354 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2439355 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2439356 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2439357 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2439358 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2439385 seit monaten haben beobachter vermutet dass moskaus prokovationen in georgien den zweck hatten einen krieg im kaukasus auszul sen nun sieht es so aus als h tte russland bekommen was es wollte georgien repr sentiert genau das was moskau an seiner grenze nicht sehen will ein land das sowohl unabh ngig als auch zusehends demokratisch ist moskau sucht stattdessen unterwerfung vorzugsweise unter autokratische herrscher die es manipulieren kann
2439386 mit seiner entscheidung s dossetien zu befreien oder wie er sagte die verfassungsordnung wiederherzustellen hat der georgische pr sident saakaschwili einen riesigen fehler begangen wie fr her slobodan milosevic hat er nicht begriffen dass sein land nur zwischen dem abschied von den abtr nnigen republiken abchasien und s dossetien und dem zerfall des landes infolge blutiger konflikte w hlen kann wahrscheinlich hat georgiens pr sident listig darauf gesetzt dass am freitag als die olympischen spiele begannen russland neutral bleiben w rde das erwies sich als naiv weil moskau eine solche gelegenheit niemals verpassen w rde saakaschwili ein politiker auf den der westen und polen gesetzt hatten wird eher fr her als sp ter f r seinen fehler bezahlen
2439387 gelingt es nicht die waffenruhe von 1992 wieder herzustellen droht ein balkan szenario die s dosseten w rden eher nach russland abwandern als die georgische oberhoheit anzuerkennen
2439388 der georgische pr sident michail saakaschwili stemmt sich gegen die einsch chterungsversuche der russen und setzt auf die hilfe westlicher l nder doch er macht sich illusionen die nato wird kaum einen krieg gegen russland riskieren um georgien zu retten jetzt muss die eu unter franz sischem vorsitz die initiative wieder ergreifen um zu verhindern dass die beziehungen zu russland sich unwiederbringlich verschlechtern
2439389 michail saakaschwili hat in einem seiner ruhigen augenblicke s dossetien die autonomie innerhalb georgiens angeboten dies muss die grundlage dringender diplomatischer bem hungen sein um beide seiten vom abgrund zur ckzuziehen
2439390 zu lange haben die beteiligten akteure am pulverfass kaukasus gez ndelt jetzt ist es explodiert irgendwann h tte ein kluger kopf stopp sagen m ssen aber keiner tat es die russen verhinderten st rrisch jede l sung des konflikts die usa ihrerseits haben den georgischen pr sidenten saakaschwili bedenkenlos unterst tzt mit waffen mit experten und mit internationaler r ckendeckung doch nun hat sich der georgische zauberlehrling selbstst ndig gemacht und einen krieg vom zaun gebrochen in seiner selbstverblendung hoffte saakaschwili wohl auf einen schnellen sieg er hat sich verrechnet

2439449 it seemed like i couldnt get away from them that they had their own life they were demanding to be written you know it was like i had to keep my catchers mitt on all the time to get these songs and that was a great great feeling
2439450 it was a multi layered education to tour with him right after high school because you know i not only got to sock in this time with my dad but i also watched him from the wings every night for a couple of years and that was an education in itself
2439451 i mean at that time i didnt think about becoming a performer myself but i think in some way i assimilated what i saw you know his natural way with an audience
2439452 these songs are from black cadillac and this is a record where the past the present and the future are like mixed parts and all come together
2439453 it was very well balanced and he wasnt self referential to any great degree

2439455 oh mercy i thought it was such an achingly beautiful love song
2439456 now its here as a folk version and something that sounds like dylan with brian eno and the edge to hear the way the songs and lyrics develop is fascinating dylan comes across as a folk singer a blues musician and a jazz artist
2439457 the songs and performances are of such strength and diversity they will appeal to new fans and longtime fans

2439484 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2439485 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2439486 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2439487 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2439488 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful

2439502 every tyranny has at hand one of those learned men to think and write to justify to extenuate and to disguise sometimes it has many of them because literature is often coupled with an appetite for luxury and with the latter comes a willingness to sell oneself to whomever can satisfy it
2439503 he is perhaps the best new songwriter weve heard in the last 15 years
2439504 a master of introspective ballads filled with understated yearning and an exquisite sense of metaphor
2439505 lyric based folk pop with a whole lot of small town idealism and one devastating break up thrown in for good measure
2439506 meg hutchinsons songs have a way of making us believe shes telling the truth at least as she sees it in a brooding sea of inscrutable urban songwriters her whispery knowable voice feels like its sharing her secrets with us set to elegant free floating melodies that feel both modern and rooted her lyrics are always seeking if not actually finding hope at the end of lifes dark tunnels
2439507 i was working on getting over some difficult things in my life during those months there was this small sign pavement ends and then youd hit the bridge and be airborne the songs on this album grew out of this work of getting beyond
2439508 what if i woke up tomorrow and i couldnt love the truth is that is something i am petrified of but maybe id be relieved to find out that grieving is what loves about
2439509 i really enjoy finding fellow artists in the city who are still in that place where the idea of reaching a new audience for their work however large or small is what gets them out of bed in the morning basically its the reason i still live here and probably always will
2439510 however what i really liked is in the past year hes made a concerted effort to be a better rebounder and use his size inside to take advantage of matchups
2439511 he was always a shooter but hes made an effort to drive to the basket to attack the rim
2439512 i think that was a good move on his part
2439513 coach barnes said he needed a bigger version of a j
2439514 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2439515 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it
2439516 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2439517 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is
2439518 i just have the feeling theyre with me all the way
2439519 this is something for me thats very tough because its end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
2439520 but these guys are good enough to compete with anyone else in the world
2439521 chinas athletes have better tolerance to the polluted air he said
2439522 an amazing addition to our staff her r sum is simply put mind blowing
2439523 weve known him since he was knee high to a gopher
2439524 terms that you heard back then when you hear them now they just pop back into your head
2439525 hes been around those kind of people all his life
2439526 a lot of people dont have that opportunity to have someone who knows the game around them all the time
2439527 pressures just what you put on yourself if you just go out there and do it its not a big deal
2439528 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2439529 how cool how good is it that were going to play in a game that might be the most viewed game in the history of sport come on
2439530 i remember growing up inner city of chicago shooting at a basket in a schoolyard hoping that one person would watch me and now im going to have a chance to coach my countrys team in front of a billion people are you kidding
2439531 the energy the one thing about these games is that they are shorter games than nba games teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2439532 i love the chinese people and i love the fans here so hopefully they wont hate us too long
2439533 when he got hurt i was more concerned with him being healthy than anything because i know how big and how important playing in front of his country is to him
2439534 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2439535 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2439536 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2439537 in 04 i hated every minute of it i didnt enjoy it
2439538 it will rip my heart out when i have to sit there and watch that race the 200 here on the sidelines
2439539 i have been aiming for a result in the 58 seconds i want to show a battle at a high level
2439540 i left athens with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder
2439541 he has his coaches come to my pool and kind of watch how i train
2439542 but i could care less about how he trains i know what it takes for me to swim fast and i know what it takes for me to win the gold medal
2439543 i win that race by a body length it was just a really bad day at the office and a really important day at the office like i said before im past it im over it ive got a really good thing going on here and ive having the time of my life
2439544 if anyone can make a mistake its him because everybody is watching him if he makes a mistake slip right on by him like you did me
2439545 thats the best way to explain it having fun all this makes everything that i did to get here worthwhile
2439546 i just thought if i kept working hard everything would finally fall into place
2439547 mikes not the kind of guy who comes out here looking for personal gain
2439548 he comes out here and tries to do the best he can every day to help the club win he works hard and gets his work in in the last home stand he made a base running mistake the next day he was out there trying to get it straightened out
2439549 im playing in the big leagues now and they know how long ive worked at it to get here
2439550 every player i dont care how mean he is if he hits a foul ball in the stands and somebody gets hit they feel bad
2439551 when they get back in the batters box i pretty much guarantee you that theyre not all 100 percent like they were before that pitch
2439552 the danger of being injured by thrown bats fragments thereof and thrown or batted balls
2439553 you still think about it at night wondering how that kid is doing or how that man is doing that i hit you feel sorry about it
2439554 you know the fans are vulnerable these people that are coming to watch the game theyre not trained to get out of the way of a ball
2439555 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2439556 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2439557 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2439558 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2439559 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2439560 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2439561 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2439562 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2439563 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2439564 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2439565 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2439566 the olympics to me is a benchmark for how fast weve gone with technology
2439567 thirty months ago no one was talking about youtube now its a verb
2439568 chris has been here forever and he knows it about as good as anybody hes tremendous in the blitz pickup game and has great hands
2439569 vondrell is a little more of a downhill runner hes a move the pile kind of guy
2439570 fozzy has unbelievable lateral quickness he would remind our fans somewhat of hodges mitchell where he has the ability to jump lateral and then pick speed up really quickly
2439571 in this time in college you need more than one running back mcgee said
2439572 all three of the guys bring a different aspect to the game individually and when you put all of that together it makes us a dangerous group collectively ogbonnaya said
2439573 we feed off one another and it makes us better
2439574 i think he just does it to make sure we know whats going on
2439575 im pretty sure he always knows exactly whats going on on the field
2439576 the first thing that jumps out at you is the team speed
2439577 the maturity level is always the no 1 concern when youve got a lot of young guys
2439578 how are they going to react under pressure how are they going to act in a tough situation how are they going to react when a negative play happens how are they going to act when a positive play happens can you move onto the next thing
2439579 i really noticed the first day that it was pretty smoggy we landed on the plane and i think we were all like wow is this weather is this smog is this fog what is it it was kind of surprising to see that
2439580 the air quality i think its good it looks a little bit misty you cannot judge the air quality by its appearance you have to trust the scientists
2439581 i dont know i just kept going with what i had
2439582 do what they used to do when they traveled around in the old days
2439583 i had me a long vacation not saying that i wanted it
2439584 its football season and im happy to be back to work
2439585 taking the train where the players can move around and relax a little bit will give us some time that i think we need at this point to get ready for a game
2439586 ive never really gotten nervous for preseason games but im sure i will because im in a new uniform
2439587 im doing everything that im supposed to do to make sure i get reinstated
2439588 im not even worried about that right now im worried about playing football staying out of trouble and making sure i know my plays
2439589 i have had lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center and flatten out at the end
2439590 i had got some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
2439591 he gave me cortisone and steroids which were very painful and it was annoying and difficult to be to trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time
2439592 its like i forgot how to play golf i looked like a 20 handicap
2439593 i didnt three putt a single green with the hybrid and that was after five three putts with the regular one
2439594 i might bend my putter to an 18 degree loft tonight maybe thats the way to putt these greens
2439595 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2439596 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2439597 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2439598 hugest thing thats happened to leadville since we discovered gold
2439599 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited
2439600 a race like this takes a lot of experience and endurance he has that so i guess hes the odds on favorite
2439601 i would reiterate that ill be happy if im top five i dont think im in it to win it as they say
2439602 i dont think lance does anything on a lark i think hell be prepared
2439603 i dont know how prepared floyd was last year what im saying is if we were equally prepared i just cant see where those guys wouldnt pummel me
2439604 dave wiens is super human hes just as fantastic on mountain bikes as lance armstrong is on road bikes
2439605 hes got plenty of creativity if youve got great players though you can beat most of the teams if you just execute
2439606 i might should have redshirted looking back quarterback is a tough position
2439607 if i wanted to be i was ranked no 2 in the nation as a receiver when i transferred in as a junior at dallas summit at the end of the day it crossed my mind this summer but i feel most at home at quarterback im a leader and i like to be at quarterback when its fourth and 10 and we need a touchdown i want the ball in my hands
2439608 ive never seen such a big facility in my life you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are and they did an awesome job building it
2439609 its exciting when you just walk into the pool and you sort of imagine the whole thing jam packed and having it be loud
2439610 if it had continued on it would be an issue
2439611 brett favre great player hall of famer makes them tougher always a tough game when we play them all games in the national football league are tough
2439612 maybe it helps that way focuses on the pain more than oh i need to hole this putt and i dont want to make a double or make a bogey
2439613 you just follow the process and routine and you make the putt for par or birdie
2439614 he was short on about six putts under 8 feet
2439615 youve got a group of guys malcolm williams made a great play yesterday in a team situation youve got brandon collins youve got james kirkendoll youve got dan buckner
2439616 weve got some really good competition going on there and i feel like by the time that we break camp well have five or six guys that well feel really good about
2439617 hes really got unique speed for his size and thats going to help him a lot plus he loves the game and hes always trying to learn i think thats probably my favorite thing about him hes really personal and ready to learn
2439618 i like throwing the ball deep to malcolm he does a good job of not letting the defense put their hands on him hes big and strong and gets off the line
2439619 hes coming along every day hes catching a lot of balls we spent a lot of time together in the summer working on his hands playing with tennis balls and things like that
2439620 dan has a lot of talent and body control plus hes fast
2439621 you definitely could see him being a deep threat there are a lot of young receivers with a lot of talent
2439622 i dont have a timetable for figuring out the receivers
2439623 there are plenty of guys capable of making plays and weve just got to get the right ones out there weve got two guys right now who we know we can count on in jordan shipley and quan cosby
2439624 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the online gaming industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
2439625 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
2439626 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
2439627 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
2439628 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
2439629 because weve noted a huge demand for online gaming transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for online gaming companies and many others
2439630 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase online gaming items but choose to do offline
2439631 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
2439632 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy online gaming stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
2439633 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
2439634 paying online for most online gaming purchases is quite easy just join a payment solution or e wallet and then shop till you drop
2439635 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
2439636 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
2439637 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
2439638 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
2439639 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
2439640 imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge is limited imagination encirles the world
2439641 in everyones life at some time our inner fire goes out it is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being we should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit
2439642 ive read what you wrote me i just dont have a response but feel free to continue talking
2439643 there are now 660 designated safe cities across the country
2439644 you have probably never heard of l 1 but there is every chance that it has heard of you
2439645 the paper was mined for ideas by the u s government as well as by private companies hoping to grab a piece of the suddenly booming market in spy tools
2439646 roll down your window and place your hands out so he can see you are not sporting a gun dummy

2439649 im not going to give you a ticket but the traffic cam nailed your ass and you will be getting one in the mail
2439650 what you arent leaving are you i was really hoping you knew a large black man with a sour temperment that you could put me in a cell with for a few hours
2439651 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
2439652 many years later as he faced the firing squad colonel aureliano buend a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice
2439653 the past is a foreign country they do things differently there
2439654 as gregor samsa awoke from a night of uneasy dreaming he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect
2439655 there are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world those who are afraid to try themselves and those who are afraid that you will succeed
2439656 slechts n keer moest de prins vanwege ziekte verstek laten gaan en daarover had hij behoorlijk de pest in

2439659 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2439660 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2439661 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2439662 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2439663 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2439664 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2439665 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2439666 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2439667 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2439668 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2439669 i am not fond of that phrase either but it is the popular one that everyone understands
2439670 it was literally what it sounds like burgers then drive a few blocks over get your divorce and go back to work couples should be encouraged by courts to try and work it out first
2439671 i will pop your butt if you say that again you do not talk about your parents that way
2439672 there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear involves torment but he who fears has not been made perfect in love
2439673 we received a call that someone was smelling fumes in the area and we investigated with the coast guard and found oil in the canal between the power plant and the barrier
2439674 it didnt get into dickinson bayou and was stopped in the canal but there was an impact to coastal waters
2439675 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2439676 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2439677 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2439678 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2439679 fueled by an illegal marketing campaign designed to promote the powerful drug for unapproved uses for children for seniors with dementia and for sleeping disorders to name a few
2439680 patients like wanda bernal of claymont who has taken seroquel for two years for her sleeping disorder said she was diagnosed six months ago with diabetes a disease linked to antipsychotic drugs
2439681 because if i do i wont be able to sleep at all
2439682 we do believe its critical for people with mental illness to get the treatment they need
2439683 because if i do i wont be able to sleep at all
2439684 theres something very unique about this compound that has been proven through clinical studies to work across a wide range of mental illnesses
2439685 you had 10 to 15 years of marketing in which the companies controlled the journal publications controlled the speakers bureaus controlled the dinners controlled the patient advocacy groups all of which communicated these drugs were a breakthrough
2439686 from the outset defendants recognized the need to promote nonmedically accepted indications and nonmedically necessary uses as the key to blockbuster success for their respective antipsychotic drugs
2439687 astrazeneca strenuously denies the allegations in these lawsuits most of which have been brought by private personal injury lawyers and will defend itself in these lawsuits
2439688 fda and the courts have recognized that off label prescribing by doctors is not only lawful but may be essential to giving patients optimal medical care
2439689 the decision to treat a patient using a medicine outside the scope of the labeling is a medical judgment made by the physician
2439690 we can acknowledge that we are part of a multistate investigation of the drug
2439691 astrazeneca intends to litigate these cases on the merits and will defend the cases vigorously
2439692 a large part of the legal problems attributed to zyprexa if they exist are arguably due to the failure of the responsible federal agencies to prevent abuse
2439693 because of my particular experience with my illness it was absolutely a miracle drug and ive been on it ever since
2439694 ive never been this big and ive had four kids
2439695 that particular use of it i dont think was marketed heavily as an off label indication by the company
2439696 docs have got to be judicious in using this and really look at how it works in the long term
2439697 i fear that the leaking of dr williams letters even if they are from eight years ago will give more comfort to those who see the church as a leftover from the past than to those who would like to see it stand up boldly for the values on which it was built for a while the traditionalists will rally around that charismatic conservative the archbishop of york dr john sentamu but the fellow travellers will drift away leaderless with neither a church nor a political party prepared to champion their views and beliefs of course the grubby british national party will attempt to pose as a home for the moral majority promising a return to the traditions and certainty of the past fortunately its gruesome pedigree means that it has no credibility among the vast majority of people so who is left watch out for the challenge from the mosques an islam with a modern face will soon begin to present itself as the natural home for those who long for moral certainty and a new sense of discipline within society the calls for a caliphate a religious state based on sharia law will be toned down the firebrand preachers will be done away with by the moderates and there will be talk of the founding of a secular muslim state as in turkey and with no other options on the table they may soon find that they have an awful lot of fellow travellers with whom to bolster their ranks the task for the imams will be to exploit the fatal weakness of the multicultural society and replace a christian church that has lost its sense of history and direction with a mosque that has a strong ingrained sense of both for islam that would be a justified

2439706 it is most important to note that they are mentioned almost simultaneous to gods statement that he would destroy the earth by flood and it seems from this association that their affect upon mankind was one of the primary justifications that brought the destruction

2439734 it was nice to get ahead of the game early i had a couple of chances on the back nine which would have been nice to convert on holes 11 and 13 but it was hard

2439800 this kind of incident is really sad but its also something that will be used to really examine how we can avoid this in the future
2439801 will look at three things the man the machine and the environment
2439802 theyll look at the pilots flight training experience and did he have adequate rest and was he under any particular stress
2439803 and do a stem to stern evaluation of the helicopter components and the engine to see if theres any malfunction

2439814 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2439815 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2439816 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2439817 what the fuck does this have to do with anything
2439818 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2439819 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2439820 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2439821 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2439822 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2439827 tell vera vasilevna that my storm is rumbling along and she may run the risk of hearing it at the russian musical society
2439828 in the summer of 1864 petr ilich had to write a large overture for which he chose himself the programme of ostrovskiis the storm the orchestra he employed was heretical with bass tuba cor anglais harp tremolo and divided strings bass drum and cymbals he was probably optimistic in nurturing the hope that the requirements of the programme would exempt him from any punishment for failing to follow the usual guidelines in any event by the start of term or perhaps somewhat earlier he finished his work i cannot recall the reason now but he asked me to stand in for him and sent me the score by post with a message to show it to anton grigorevich a few days later rubinstein told me to come and listen to his judgement never in my life did i receive such a dressing down for my misdemeanours as on that day as i recall it was a beautiful sunday morning listening on behalf of someone else

2439833 in talking to our folks they do not have any imminent concern that

2439835 last night the people were afraid and families on tractors trucks and taxis fled the area
2439836 from a strategic military point of view arghandab is a very good place for the taliban
2439837 arghandab is close to city allowing the taliban to launch ambushes and attacks more easily than any other place in the province secondly its covered with trees and gardens they can easily hide from airstrikes
2439838 they told us we want to fight until the death
2439839 weve occupied most of the area and its a good place for fighting now we are waiting for the nato and afghan forces
2439840 they told us to leave the area within 24 hours because they want to fight foreign and afghan troops
2439841 but within a week we should be harvesting and we were expecting a good one now with this fighting we are deeply worried the grapes are the only source of income we have

2439847 those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves
2439848 be generous give to those you love give to those who love you give to the fortunate give to the unfortunate yes give especially to those you dont want to give you will receive abundance for you giving the more you give the more will have
2439849 to do something however small to make others happier and better is the highest ambition the most elevating hope which can inspire a human being
2439850 there are no great things only small things with great love happy are those
2439851 wherever there is a human being there is an opportunity for kindness
2439852 see to do good and you will find that happiness will run after you
2439853 the flower of kindness will grow maybe not now but it will some day and in that kindness will flow for kindness grows in this way
2439854 have you had a kindness shown pass it on twas not given for thee alone pass it on let it travel down the years let it wipe anothers tears till in heaven the deed appears pass it on
2439855 when you carry out acts of kindness you get a wonderful feeling inside it is as though something inside your body responds and says yes this is how i ought to feel
2439856 so many gods so many creeds so many paths that wind and wind while just the art of being kind is all the sad world needs
2439857 little kindness will broaden your heart and slowly you will habituate yourself to helping your fellow man in many ways
2439858 be kind everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle
2439859 kindness is the golden chain by which society is bound together
2439860 a kind heart is a fountain of gladness making everything in its vicinity into smiles
2439861 giving is so often thought of in terms of the things we give but our greatest giving is of our time and kindness and even comfort for those who need it we look on these gifts as unimportant until we need them
2439862 to cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life
2439863 let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile
2439864 if you have not often felt the joy of doing a kind act you have neglected much and most of all yourself
2439865 those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves
2439866 one can pay back the loan of gold but one lies forever in debt to those who are kind
