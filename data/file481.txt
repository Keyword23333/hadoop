4810127 when you lose your most experienced and best receiver coming back it certainly hurts you especially when you are trying to find a quarterback

4810199 this is a viral campaign with people saying dont support vodacom the black empowerment deal is racist because white people cant participate if people want to be racist to that degree its a war we cant win
4810200 it is a great sadness to read that the proposed empowerment deal will only be to the benefit of all black sa citizens
4810201 personally i find this to be blatant discrimination and totally unfair to your loyal white customer base
4810202 to blatantly exclude white citizens is a hugely unfair decision
4810203 vodacom sells products to businesses government and groups which require the presentation of acceptable empowerment credentials
4810204 we can only invite black people and black groups to participate
4810205 there are always disgruntled people we got some e mails and a number of phone calls
4810206 some were genuinely unhappy because they had been excluded and they felt we have had enough time to change things around in the country so everybody should be entitled now
4810207 a couple were hardliners we spoke to them very gently to explain that this is the new sa and we are planning to make a meaningful contribution in redressing the past
4810208 we had overwhelming support for the deal from all levels of the community
4810209 these offers are only for black people so it is racially exclusive but its mandated by law the companies are doing deals to meet the legal requirements
4810210 they dont even think about empowerment until it affects them directly and releases their resentments its understandable because people have been customers for years and believe they should also be given an opportunity to buy shares
4810211 but thats not the point its black empowerment and thats about empowering black people
4810212 in the end these companies stand and fall by their services and their prices obviously vodacom doesnt want to lose any customers and its white customers probably have money but it is forced to do a deal and by offering shares to the black public it is doing it in the most participative way possible at least it is trying to spread the shares around as much as possible
4810213 we are firmly committed to the process of achieving transformation in sa and specifically ensuring that a broad spectrum of black south africans and black women benefit

4810247 ahora es tiempo de mirar y trabajar la ingenier a colectiva del futuro de paraguay no ser f cil pero no ser imposible
4810248 asumimos el compromiso con los hombres y mujeres de nuestra historia que nos interpelan hoy a no desperdiciar refuerzos a no fallar el rumbo a no bajar los sue os del altar de la esperanza
4810249 este proceso no tiene vencedores ni vencidos sino que es el cambio para asumir el proceso de convertir a paraguay en una de las democracias consolidadas del mundo
4810250 hoy termina un paraguay exclusivo secretista y con fama de corrupci n
4810251 no sabemos cu nto nos demoraremos para aliviar esta inequidad no s si lograremos tumbar el monstruo de la miseria pero el paraguay cambiar trabajando evaluando y construyendo por nuestro pa s
4810252 vos tienes un ladrillo en tus manos de este nuevo edificio llamado paraguay ac rcate no importa a qu sector pol tico respondes en este pa s se acabaron las afiliaciones pol ticas para lograr un puesto de trabajo en la funci n p blica
4810253 mi propuesta de gobierno cree en la poes a de la patria sin murallas cree en la ecuaci n de fronteras f rtiles antes que oclusivas
4810254 damos la bienvenida y el respaldo a diversos esfuerzos de integraci n ya vigentes o en proceso
4810255 la democracia est avanzando en el paraguay hoy vivimos un momento hist rico por primera vez se produce la transferencia de poder de un partido a otro en un clima de esperanza
4810256 estoy seguro que el presidente lugo y su equipo continuar n con el camino de quienes escogimos la pol tica como convicci n y como decisi n
4810257 hoy tenemos la posibilidad de reafirmar los pilares de la democracia con mejores resultados sociales con mayor integraci n de los bienes pol ticos
4810258 en estos 5 a os como un hombre de familia quiero expresar con absoluta sinceridad que puse todo mi empe o por la patria es una tarea dram tica diaria en la que algunos cuando llega el alba encuentran mas derrotas que victorias
4810259 nos pareci un programa de gobierno que desafortunadamente el pueblo dominicano no tuvo conocimiento para las elecciones del 16 de mayo del 2008
4810260 es decir los dominicanos tuvimos un presidente que habl de que tenemos una ley que sanciona el fraude el ctrico pero es el mismo presidente leonel fern ndez que promovi que la referida ley no se cumpliera
4810261 los cambios han impactado en los mun cipes de la ciudad de santo domingo creando un sentido de pertenencia de la ciudad la base de sustentaci n de este progreso evidente obedece principalmente al proceso de consolidaci n que han tenido las pol ticas que recogen el plan estrat gico del plan de desarrollo
4810262 ahora rusia necesita hacer honor a este acuerdo retirar sus fuerzas de georgia y por supuesto poner fin a sus operaciones militares
4810263 el tema principal es que la lucha de rusia por las regiones de osetia y abjasia no debe formar parte del futuro de georgia estas regiones son parte de georgia y la comunidad internacional ha repetido hasta la saciedad que seguir n si ndolo
4810264 estas resoluciones est n basadas en la premisa de que osetia del sur y abjasia permanecen dentro de las fronteras de georgia y que cualquier conflicto internacional sobre este tema se debe resolver mediante negociaciones internacionales
4810265 los suministros est n siendo repartidos entre el pueblo georgiano y en los pr ximos d as llegar n m s

4810268 a lot of religious voters are trying to make up their mind about how theyll vote
4810269 a lot say they have some preference for mccain but a lot of that preference is soft and many are still open the candidates faith and how they connect to issues is important to those voters
4810270 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4810271 some secularists think i am going to make this a christian or religious litmus test for the presidency while many religious people assume i am going to wimp out and not ask about issues involving sanctity of life and the family including abortion stem cell research and traditional marriage neither is reflective of my position or purpose in this process
4810272 i will ask all the tough questions but this is a conversation not a confrontation and i am going to be civil in our discussion people know where i stand on the critical issues however this forum is not about me and what i believe but to give a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership
4810273 hey i can run real fast to the store and make this dish hubby would love it

4810323 were a community of older folks and people say old folks dont change but many of my supporters were older men
4810324 all the other cities in our area were flourishing and we were seeing ours deteriorate

4810330 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4810331 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4810332 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4810333 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4810334 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4810335 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4810336 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4810337 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4810338 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4810339 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4810340 my plan is to stay connected to space in some new capacity i am very excited about exploring that and seeing where it takes me i am fully committed to this industry and have much still to contribute
4810341 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4810369 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots

4810444 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4810471 many studies have asked how terrorist groups are born relatively few have described how such groups are best put out of business a recent effort to do the latter by rand corporation an american think tank is therefore welcome it considers the fate of some 650 groups defined widely between 1968 and 2006 asking in particular what put an end to them in the process it casts some useful light on a hoary old question of counterterrorism whether military force or smart policing is the more effective method for tackling terrorists and insurgents proponents of military force have quite a bit to cheer at the moment most notably there is the success of the military surge in iraq in tackling al qaeda and other insurgents other changes such as a shift in allegiance of sunnis have helped too in sri lanka in january president mahinda rajapakse formally scrapped a cease fire agreement that had been signed in 2002 with the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the campaign against the separatists has been growing more intense with the government forces claiming that the tigers will be defeated next year on friday august 15th sri lankan soldiers said that they had killed 26 rebels in fighting in the far north of the island colombias president alvaro uribe has similarly pursued the military option against the farc managing to kill thousands of the groups members including several leaders in march colombian forces with american training and a heavy dose of intelligence work bombed a jungle camp in ecuador killing raul reyes an important figure in the movement and recovering computers containing valuable information then in july colombian forces freed ingrid betancourt a former candidate for president and 14 others who had been held hostage by the farc for several years mr uribe had resisted calls for negotiations to secure their release according to rand some 20 of the insurgencies it considered have been ended through the use of overwhelming military might but such force seems to tell only in particular situations where opponents are large organised like armies and occupy territory military methods are likely to be more effective insurgencies however are a specific set of conflicts comparable to civil wars where hundreds or more have died on both sides involved when it comes to terrorist groups more broadly military might is less useful as the rand study points out the vast majority of terrorist groups have fewer than 100 members it considered groups ranging from the tiny such as the oklahoma city bombers to the massive such as aum shinrikyo the movement responsible for a nerve gas attack on tokyos subway in 1995 for isolated cells and other groups conventional military weapons are unwieldy and often ineffective the think tank says that military action put an end to only 7 of the terrorist groups that it looked at rand concludes that police sleuthing and more intelligence work are often more useful methods when tackling smaller groups and organisations perhaps including al qaeda that operate in the shadows of the 268 terrorist organisations that folded the most common reason was a change of method in favour of a political process this happened in 43 of cases and was mainly possible where groups had specific goals that might be accommodated a similar number of groups some 40 were dismantled with the help of police and intelligence work the think tank which regularly conducts research for the defence department therefore suggests that the current american strategy against terrorism is flawed the reports authors urge a fundamental rethinking of policies against al qaeda arguing that americas campaign should no longer be waged as a war on terror but instead conducted as a counter terrorism mission the authors say that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism saying intelligence and policing should get more attention
4810472 what exactly do you mean by a calculation of interests in muslim western conflicts the choice to engage in violence or peace isnt the projection of any ideological cultural or religious factors but instead a strategic calculation or a calculation of interests a group opts to use violent approaches or peaceful methods depending on each approachs incentives or disincentives who is considered the enemy and what confrontational method will be used is often determined more by a calculation of interests than of ideology religion or culture for example lets consider relations between what we commonly refer to as the afghan mujahideen and the united states these various afghan opposition groups were allies of the united states while fighting against the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s at that time the united states considered them freedom fighters or heroes now however some of these same groups are fighting against the united states the new occupying force and are therefore indiscriminately called terrorists it is the perspective of each party how it sees its challenges interests and positions that influences whether it becomes allies or enemies with the other does this mean the clash of civilizations is nonsense i think its a forced terminology what really happens is a polarization and it has occurred in many forms throughout the history of mankind there are polarizations in culture ideology race and religion polarization has become an innate part of life itself samuel p huntingtons clash of civilizations is too forced as if there is a specific religious cultural conflict between the muslim world and the west there isnt throughout history conflicts pitted as clashes between civilizations werent solely about religion for example the crusaders also had interests in land and politics what about ideological or religious motives behind muslim western conflicts do you deny such motives i dont deny them ideological or religious motives of course exist however they only occur at the micro or individual level religion or ideology is just a tool that is hijacked to recruit and motivate people and to create solidarity with the perpetrators to whom it gives an air of legitimacy these conflicts are presented as ideological or religious campaigns in order to inspire followers legitimate the war as a just war and attract allies etc that is why we need to use rational strategic analysis to enable us to acknowledge potentially violent conflict that is about to arise so we can find a way to prevent it but if we only employ a cultural framework an approach that sees the psycho religious cultural variables influentially shaping the actions of a person or a group we would walk in circles without ever learning how to solve the conflict dont you think that hijacking ideology culture or religion for such strategic interests shows that they could be lethal weapons exactly ideology culture and religion are all excellent weapons for creating solidarity because of their transcendental and messianic values but as weapons they are used for external interests not for themselves when the external interests are achieved they might be used for other strategic interests which in the case of geopolitical change could turn allies into enemies what do you think about the future of muslim western relations today the situation is fascinating islam grows and exists in prominent civilizational centers such as in the capital cities of america and europe as a minority muslims there have to express their religious nature and negotiate muslim values through the language and structures of the host country becoming part of its civilizational treasure the same thing is also experienced by westerners that live in the muslim world it is in the hands of these ambassadors that the future of muslim western relations lies for they are in the privileged position of being fully a part of both muslim and western societies

4810492 it led me to wonder why exactly singaporeans would want to have kids if they are treated as merely an economic necessity
4810493 purely economic the aim is to generate a steady stream of future workers for singapore inc
4810494 its not because having kids will provide a happy family life
4810495 its to bolster our economic competitiveness and indeed our economic survival after all no babies means no workers for the future right no workers means our economy will be affected
4810496 as long as we have a dynamic economy we can solve our problems
4810497 i work 15 hours a day and i still am not sure if i will be able to retire so why have kids just do what we can eventually die and thats it

4810514 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4810515 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4810516 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4810517 it would be good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4810518 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4810519 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4810520 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4810521 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4810522 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4810523 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4810524 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4810525 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4810526 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man

4810565 the heroes are less likely to provide excuses for themselves and one of the common excuses is everyone is doing it or for some reason or another i am entitled to do it
4810566 i think that the basic honesty of the heroes extends a little bit to other people in that they may think that theyre more honest than others but they dont see other people as extremely dishonest or willing to cheat
4810567 even at schools that have extensive cheating based on what other students are telling me theres always a group of students who will wonder why im bothering to do this survey on their campus because they never see any cheating and they dont think anybody else cheats
4810568 as a result of that if theyre hanging out in groups or cliques that dont cheat therefore they dont see a lot of cheating
4810569 to me those are the people who have met the requirements of what theyre doing and to call that heroic is i think to minimize our basic expectations of students
4810570 we expect them to perform on these assignments and other things without cheating so when they do that thats great and i dont want to minimize that but at the same time im not sure they should be called heroes
4810571 for people that assert that they are definitely going to cheat and people who assert that they are not at all going to cheat it might be difficult to influence their behaviour but people who assert theyre uncertain suggests a population that might be more amenable to interventions
4810572 its a matter of having students involved having faculty administrators families peers anyone who could possibly be involved should be

4810592 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
4810593 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
4810594 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally
4810595 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone

4810634 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
4810635 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
4810636 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
4810637 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
4810638 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
4810639 this wasnt a visit it was telling me to go away and never come back
4810640 we are seeing more investment in social and supportive housing than ever in the history of the city
4810641 the downtown eastside will be for many years a place you find people of low incomes
4810642 there has been an effort to keep all the social problems in one neighbourhood and i do not think that serves the people who have those problems very well
4810643 we find that when they can move outside the downtown eastside a lot of problems go away
4810644 when you start having numbers of people camping out you start moving into personal safety issues
4810645 before anyone could be harmed a solution even short term needed to be found
4810646 it was a public relations disaster to have 40 people in tents just a couple of blocks from gm place where olympics events will be happening
4810647 no one is being pushed out of any area because of the olympics
4810648 certainly you cannot handle all their addiction and mental health issues in the downtown eastside some people would do better if they were given opportunities we are not going to take them and force them to go anywhere but certainly the options have to be there for them
4810649 were certainly open to helping anyone who wants to do that
4810650 were looking at the entire province not just the downtown eastside when were looking at housing
4810651 we said you guys find the land in the communities and we are there with capital and thats what weve been doing
4810652 if we can get somebody in an environment where there are other supports around them their success rate is definitely higher than if we leave them isolated in the downtown eastside
4810653 theyre told they can get a one way ticket either to some other part of canada or some other part of the province
4810654 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4810655 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4810656 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4810657 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4810658 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4810659 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4810660 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4810661 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4810662 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4810663 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4810664 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4810665 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro de hoy es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4810666 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores que las de hoy y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4810667 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4810668 no estoy feliz ellos han jugado con mucha m s intensidad y no hemos sido capaces de jugar con la misma intensidad veintiocho robos de bal n es un n mero con el que no puedes tener posibilidad de ganar

4810806 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4810807 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4810808 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive

4810810 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4810811 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4810812 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4810813 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4810814 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4810815 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4810816 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way

4811125 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4811126 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4811127 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4811128 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4811129 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4811130 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4811131 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4811132 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4811133 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4811134 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4811135 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future

4811137 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4811138 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone

4811151 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4811152 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong

4811400 i just felt the time had come to tell the story of my lifetime achievements and mishaps
4811401 i didnt mind the negativity i felt it was all part of the story and hopefully it is something young singers and performers can learn from
4811402 i also wanted to do it for my two sons so they can see it and relate to what their daddy is all about
4811403 he wrote that song and i didnt ask for that
4811404 this song came on and a lot of other stuff came in the door for example id be riding my bike to the local dairy and the little kids would come out and throw stones at me
4811405 its only in recent years and ive come to appreciate that its quite a lovely thing to have a song named after you and its also a beautiful song

4811409 i respected very much the feelings which he expressed in his poems the anger the longing the hope and the hope for peace between two peoples
4811410 i yearn for my mothers bread and my mothers coffee
4811411 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanise and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
4811412 i would not have returned a good morning to many of those who now say they are my friends

4811414 georgia and russia have stumbled into a war that need not have happened the price of their political calculation and folly is being paid by civilians on both sides

4811418 once again we have worked well together as a team bridgestone have given us some excellent rain tires and were on pole so that is very satisfying
4811419 the points are not dished out until tomorrow and anything can happen especially in the wet so well just stay focused stay relaxed and hope the weather stays dry
4811420 i hope that we are in good shape for tomorrow if its wet or dry
4811421 for sure though like everyone else i hope it will be dry because the conditions today were really terrible
4811422 i am pleased for myself but also for kawasaki as huge improvements have been made on the bike since i last rode it at assen the bridgestone tires are working really well too at this circuit and i feel confident for tomorrow whatever the conditions our aim is for a top five finish as i want to be realistic about what we can achieve but weve definitely put ourselves in a great position for the race

4811425 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4811426 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4811427 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4811428 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4811429 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4811430 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4811431 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4811432 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy
4811433 omg look baby traffic lights lets take a picture so cuteeeee
4811434 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4811435 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4811436 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4811437 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup
4811438 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
4811439 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
4811440 bases its claims on breaches of their organisational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery
4811441 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4811442 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4811443 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4811444 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4811445 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4811446 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4811447 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4811448 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4811449 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4811450 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4811451 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4811452 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4811453 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4811454 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4811455 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4811456 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4811457 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4811458 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4811459 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4811460 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4811461 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4811462 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4811463 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4811464 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4811465 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4811466 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4811467 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4811468 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4811469 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4811470 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4811471 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4811472 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4811473 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4811474 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4811475 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4811476 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4811477 i will show how to view others comments before they are edited spell checked etc
4811478 my incorrect words are underlined with a dashed red line to show the word is misspelled but i cant click on the word to check for correct spelling
4811479 like most of the gop you were taught at an early age to never admit mistakes and if caught in one lie your ass off to cover it up no matter how petty the error
4811480 gregg i believe there is an ideology of hate bent on having its own way no matter who it hurts or who it kills and no matter what it costs it is called the gop and you are just the latest in a long line of local spin doctors attempting to twist the past to influence the future
4811481 figuring my 3rd grade teacher ms shyster wasnt grading spelling but cling to whatever helps you feel superior it is an important part of being a good liberal
4811482 step four never admit to pure dumb error at this point lash out call names
4811483 why dont we come up with a new term that is wholly little bushs i suggest association of the bullied or maybe gang of the bought
4811484 you are un american and a communist marx engels chairman ho lenin and chairman mao would be so proud

4811489 i believe there is an ideology of hate bent on having its own way no matter who it hurts or who it kills and no matter what it costs it is called the gop
4811490 if youre going to call names at least be accurate
4811491 i remember a time when rush went off and called chelsea clinton ugly on national radio

4811493 he calls himself a talent on loan from g od
4811494 hypocrite any number of shows ranting about drug addicts criminals
4811495 either you believe that there is an ideology of hate bent on murdering innocents by the thousands or you dont
4811496 really sean ok then tell me what was the joke rush said the clintons have a cat and he put up a picture of their cat then he said they had a dog and put up a picture of chelsea clinton but if that picture of chelsea was a mistake what picture was supposed to go up there what other picture could he possibly have put up that would have made that funny
4811497 were going to let you destroy your life were going to make it easy and then all of us who accept the responsibilities of life and dont destroy our lives on drugs well pay for whatever messes you get into
4811498 im appalled at people who simply want to look at all this abhorrent behavior and say people are going to do drugs anyway lets legalize it its a dumb idea its a rotten idea and those who are for it are purely 100 percent selfish
4811499 if surgeon general jocelyn elders wants to legalize drugs send the people who want to do drugs to london and zurich and lets be rid of them
4811500 what this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug use too many whites are getting away with drug sales too many whites are getting away with trafficking in this stuff the answer to this disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because were not putting others in jail who are breaking the law the answer is to go out and find the ones who are getting away with it convict them and send them up the river too
4811501 david hinckley of of the new york daily news wrote this and what he has hes got its very strange he says in a cute kid in the white house that would be chelsea out cute dog in the white house that would be millie the bushs dog could could we see the cute kid
4811502 as reported nation wide rush said everyone knows the clintons have a cat picture of socks socks is the white house cat but did you know there is a white house dog
4811503 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
4811504 rush had to have a section of his tailbone removed from pain it didnt work
4811505 most of these things on the in out list are not even funny but a couple of them one of them in particular is
4811506 there is almost no difference in correcting a persons spelling or grammar on a blog than it is in a face to face conversation pronunciation it makes you appear to be an ass with limited knowledge in the conversation or pompous enough to not have respect for others opinions you feel superior to an elitist
4811507 gentry said ive seen shysters posts baron munchausen is far more believable august 5 2008 5 04 pm

4811509 maybe the university of paris i teach western civ and there would be plenty to keep me occupied in one of the worlds longest enduring universities if not the longest
4811510 the heroes are less likely to provide excuses for themselves and one of the common excuses is everyone is doing it or for some reason or another i am entitled to do it
4811511 i think that the basic honesty of the heroes extends a little bit to other people in that they may think that theyre more honest than others but they dont see other people as extremely dishonest or willing to cheat
4811512 even at schools that have extensive cheating based on what other students are telling me theres always a group of students who will wonder why im bothering to do this survey on their campus because they never see any cheating and they dont think anybody else cheats
4811513 as a result of that if theyre hanging out in groups or cliques that dont cheat therefore they dont see a lot of cheating
4811514 to me those are the people who have met the requirements of what theyre doing and to call that heroic is i think to minimize our basic expectations of students
4811515 we expect them to perform on these assignments and other things without cheating so when they do that thats great and i dont want to minimize that but at the same time im not sure they should be called heroes
4811516 for people that assert that they are definitely going to cheat and people who assert that they are not at all going to cheat it might be difficult to influence their behaviour but people who assert theyre uncertain suggests a population that might be more amenable to interventions
4811517 its a matter of having students involved having faculty administrators families peers anyone who could possibly be involved should be
4811518 running through the finish had he done that he might have run 9 60 or even into the 9 5s
4811519 he can probably run his fifth or sixth best race and still win former sprinter ato boldon of trinidad and tobago a double bronze medalist at the 1996 olympics said of bolt
4811520 i may need more races i dont have any excuses my hamstring felt good it was no problem i wasnt overwhelmed by being at the olympics im pretty upset my family is here praying for me i feel i let them down i did my best everybody knows that
4811521 my leg is healthy 100 percent my fitness is not there my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i felt i ran out of time to prepare it just didnt come together
4811522 i was comfortable relaxed it just wasnt there i had a good start i got a little tight in the middle and tried to relax i tried to get to the finish i couldnt see anybody from lane 9 then at the end i went dang
4811523 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4811524 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4811525 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4811526 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4811527 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4811528 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4811529 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4811530 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4811531 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4811532 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4811533 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4811534 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4811535 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4811536 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4811537 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4811538 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4811539 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4811540 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4811541 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4811542 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4811543 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4811544 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4811545 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4811546 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4811547 we support the flyer fully we think drug dealers should be behind bars and addicts should be in rehab thats our approach
4811548 what they attempt to do is play on peoples fear
4811549 a veiled attack on the concept of safe injection sites
4811550 it speaks of being out of touch and not understanding the issues
4811551 saying that the junkies shouldnt be near our children is stupid because the junkies are our children
4811552 the day that we dont need to use that word and we can escape it and rid it from our vocabulary ill be a very happy individual we cant hide from the problems that we face in our communities
4811553 no child in the whole of canadian history has got aids from being jabbed by a rig in the park
4811554 im a family guy i dont want drug pushers in my neighbourhood
4811555 i think were forgetting that everyone has a right to live in this world
4811556 they only have one solution in terms of crime thats lock them up and throw away the key
4811557 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
4811558 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel
4811559 virgin hair can be waxed so successfully that growth can be permanently stopped in just 2 to 6 sessions save your child a lifetime of waxing and put the money in the bank for her college education instead
4811560 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4811561 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4811562 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4811563 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4811564 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4811565 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4811566 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4811567 all i can tell you is were dealing with a state senator for 12 years who knows the rules and chose to violate them
4811568 i would never intrude on a place where people are voting
4811569 i am appalled at the lack of respect for the sanctity of the polling place
4811570 im not going to listen to any accusations he may make
4811571 i dont even want to hear them he can make any kind of accusations he wants the fact is i won the election its time to move on
4811572 its been a week now you think you would have heard
4811573 as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4811574 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4811575 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4811576 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4811577 i dont have an ego and everyone that knows me here realizes it i know im not the best nascar driver i probably never will be because i didnt grow up racing this stuff i care a lot about it but i keep it in perspective were entertaining fans
4811578 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4811579 you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces are engaged in
4811580 have demonstrated that they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor and i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4811592 bipartisan effort will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards
4811593 raising taxes will ultimately hurt consumers by forcing them to pay even higher gas prices and republicans will oppose them
4811594 largely more of the same failed proposals theyve been trotting out for months
4811595 designed to give political cover to vulnerable democrats who are losing ground
4811596 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down on whether or not we should proceed with offshore drilling and not insert any legislative poison pills
4811597 those would be provisions that they know will never be enacted and are added only for the purpose of killing the effort to open up the outer continental shelf to drilling
4811598 rehashes washed up garbage that didnt have the ability to pass this house and theyre going to try to couple that with limited offshore production
4811599 un sue o que jam s imaginamos que podr amos lograr
4811600 joe elliot said that he thought that we have more substance than bands like poison and m tley cr e and i agree with him
4811601 it is more hard edge its kinda more alternative by just reading the reviews you get anything from the clash the sex pistols the police to the foo fighters its a three piece so its just a lot of energy and even lyrically its a lot different from what def leppard has done so far
4811602 i dont know i guess so i mean the energy and me playing guitar and me singing if you like that you will hear that all over the place
4811603 its vh1 in north america and we will actually release it in the uk in november december so we want to come back and do some tv stuff and tour
4811604 yeah absolutely we have a member from the sex pistols in the band and the pistols are on tour right now so we are waiting for a break to tour
4811605 i think we are gonna be touring again next year as well
4811606 yeah maybe we are recording a lot of cool stuff from this tour
4811607 well i was sitting next to him when this supposed feud happened and nothing happened joe said that he thought that def leppard has more substance than bands like poison and m tley cr e and thats all he said and i agree with him you know its not a feud i think if you ask the other guys in poison and you say ok do you think that def leppard has more substance than you do as a band they would probably say yes so none of this is a feud its just headlines by the media i was sitting next to him and he didnt say anything wrong
4811608 okay but if joe had said something nasty great but he didnt he didnt say anything nasty at all
4811609 the governor returns from a short hiatus to bring you another mighty episode of the governors ball
4811610 the lga is a voluntary lobbying organisation acting as the voice of the local government sector and an authoritative and effective advocate on its behalf
4811611 the thing is i cant just hug a stranger when i win singles
4811612 in singles youre all alone on the court you win you sit down this is quite a surreal moment its a joy sharing this victory with somebody else who i like very much who we had a great two weeks with its quite different to anything ive ever gone through
4811613 i told myself let me try for a big second serve because i know i have it in my game otherwise ill have stanley at the net finishing it off himself
4811614 its a dream come true moment it comes around maybe once in a lifetime
4811615 they play with a purpose and thats to show everyone else theyre superior thats the bottom line
4811616 when we get everybody on the same page its kind of hard to beat us
4811617 its a moment you never want to forget in your life
4811618 its not just about five players we had 18 000 fans with a very strong power behind us
4811619 we survived the group of death china will bring more surprises it feels like we won a medal already
4811620 when i rode into the arena i thought this runs like sliced bread and i was very relaxed but then later i needed to get every point that was still out there for me
4811621 i dont care which colour the medal is but i must not ride like this with two such big mistakes everybody knows i never give up until the end
4811622 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4811623 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4811624 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4811625 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4811626 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4811627 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4811628 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4811629 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4811630 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4811631 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4811632 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4811633 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4811634 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4811635 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4811636 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4811637 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4811638 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4811639 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4811640 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4811641 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4811642 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4811643 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4811644 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4811645 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4811646 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4811647 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4811648 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4811649 not having to deal with a computer is a big thing
4811650 theres going to be an education issue with consumers some people wont understand what checkpoint friendly is
4811651 his 1996 run for the florida state senate came unraveled when it was revealed that hed named his campaign committee for his 1986 congressional run
4811652 a substantial number of lawsuits of a vexatious frivolous and scandalous nature
4811653 at his behest at his direction or instigation or in concert with him
4811654 an incessant stream of frivolous or meritless motions demands letters to the court and other documents
4811655 holy crap im getting fat and were sending all our oil money to some places that arent our friends
4811656 to talk of many things of shoes and chips and gingersnaps of cabbage and of rings and why the tub was boiling hot and the best of all weddings
4811657 dont you call me if you dont want nothin i aint here to make friends im here to make money
4811658 im sorry i didnt know it was this kind of
4811659 i must ask then why are you throwing starfish into the ocean
4811660 the sun is up and the tide is going out if i dont throw them in theyll die
4811661 but young man do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile you cant possibly make a difference
4811662 agenda 2010 noch vor erreichen des magischen datums vergessen lassen erstmals hat der greise politrentner mit den malerisch zerknitterten z gen jetzt erkennen lassen dass er nach dem tod seiner frau bereit sein k nnte
4811663 a spoof of the far left focusing on michael moore played by kevin farley the late chris farleys brother
4811664 but its not a big problem i will just have to walk a little extra to get to my house i guess
4811665 the projects been in planning for 10 years we are here today to answer questions and provide information
4811666 after the self park stalls are filled we will give people the option to leave their vehicles with a professional parking operator who will park their vehicle in parking lot aisles or behind the self parked spaces
4811667 when they come back from work they will give the attendants the claim checks and get their cars back since there will be no attendant parking on weekdays and the flea market will continue to operate there will be limited parking then
4811668 the whole east side of the parking lot is going to close
4811669 people who live or work on that side will have to cross adeline and come in through the other side
4811670 there will be three spots on the west side for three taxis but what about the other 10 or 15
4811671 its a very big problem for taxi drivers i dont know what to do earlier we could park on woolsey but the city stopped us from doing that two months ago
4811672 you have a whole lot of cabs but only three can park at the station
4811673 we have got a game plan on how to accommodate access but we will keep looking at the challenges and address them
4811674 a few people are asking us to clarify the parking but most are curious about how the building is going to look since the west side is more congested it will take a lot more time for people to adjust we expect confusion on the first day but we will have extra bart staff out here to make sure people understand the process
4811675 right now its got a one hour parking limit but the city will be eliminating parking restrictions except from 1 to 4 a m so that people will be able to park all day
4811676 we will allow people to use the curb area adjacent to the station entrance while actively dropping off and picking up other bart riders
4811677 once construction is complete they will be able to access the station through a new elevator and stairs the building will level with adeline street we will basically be excavating the parking lot
4811678 right now i barely get a spot on the east side when i get here
4811679 there are far less spots on the west side theres no way i will find a place to park there
4811680 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
4811681 i just wanna get home and go to bed and touch myself and drink a beer and why are you wearing three rings i hate you die
4811682 this semester go out and get yourself a football player
4811683 weve got a lot of work in front of us
4811684 some players only started training very late after euro 2008
4811685 th e perseids is a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet swift tuttle the perseids are so called because the point they appear to come from called the radiant lies in the constellation perseus meteor showers occur when earth moves through a meteor stream the stream in this case is called the perseid cloud and it stretches along the orbit of the comet swift tuttle the cloud consists of particles ejected by the comet as it passed by the sun most of the dust in the cloud today is approximately a thousand years old
4811686 we have had two fourth positions in the brc on the last two events and so i think we have got to be aiming for a podium in ireland
4811687 we were getting quite close to david higgins pace on some of the stages on the manx and it would be nice now to get in front of him on some of the tests on the ulster
4811688 it is a very tough event though it is not that different to the manx in terms of how difficult it is to finish but to be honest it has always been the event i have done the best on in the last two years in the british championship i am really looking forward to it
4811689 it has not been as bad as i thought to be honest we had quite a few tests before the season started and before the pirelli we really got into the car straight away okay at times i made some silly little mistakes on the pirelli but i quickly adapted
4811690 i really love the car now and i am getting use to it geoff jones motorsport prepares a fantastic car and we are just having a great run i cant complain i am really really enjoying it
4811691 we knew that as long as the rain kept coming as it did then nobody was going to be able to go much quicker because the track conditions were so difficult once again we have worked well together as a team have given us some excellent rain tyres and were on pole so that is very satisfying
4811692 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4811693 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4811694 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4811695 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4811696 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4811697 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4811698 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4811699 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4811700 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4811701 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4811702 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4811703 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4811704 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4811705 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4811706 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4811707 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4811708 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4811709 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4811710 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4811711 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4811712 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4811713 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4811714 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
4811715 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4811716 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4811717 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4811718 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4811719 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4811720 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4811721 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4811722 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4811723 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4811724 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4811725 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4811726 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4811727 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4811728 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4811729 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4811730 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4811731 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4811732 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4811733 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4811734 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4811735 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4811736 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4811737 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4811738 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4811739 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4811740 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4811741 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4811742 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4811743 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4811744 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4811745 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4811746 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4811747 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4811748 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4811749 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4811750 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4811751 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4811752 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4811753 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4811754 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4811755 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4811756 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4811757 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4811758 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4811759 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4811760 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4811761 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4811762 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4811763 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4811764 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4811765 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4811766 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4811767 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4811768 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4811769 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4811770 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4811771 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4811772 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4811773 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4811774 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4811775 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4811776 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4811777 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4811778 who are open to doing something on the production side
4811779 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4811780 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4811781 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4811782 ich habe schon lange auf ein nasses qualifying gewartet um einmal weiter vorne zu stehen heute haben wir vom vormittag an gut gearbeitet ich hatte gro es vertrauen in mein motorrad und so konnte ich auf nasser strecke zeigen wozu ich in der lage bin ich bin auch zuversichtlich f r das rennen denn ich habe f r die front ein gutes gef hl ein guter start wird wichtig sein keine positionen verlieren und dann ein gutes rennen hinlegen
4811783 es ist nicht einfach bei solchen bedingungen ein neues motorrad zu testen aber ich war mit den rundenzeiten in der ersten session zufrieden als die strecke noch nicht so rutschig war
4811784 die dritte startreihe ist nicht schlecht aber ich muss einen guten start hinlegen und so gut wie m glich fahren mein ziel ist ein gutes erstes resultat mit diesem motorrad zu erreichen und ich will honda und meinem team viele daten liefern

4811788 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4811789 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4811790 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4811791 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4811792 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4811793 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4811794 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4811795 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4811796 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4811797 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4811798 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top
4811799 what other city in the world has pernicious wildlife running around in its city parks

4811802 we terminated those employees for walking out of the plant
4811803 we dont know why they walked but its our policy that if you walk off the job and out of the plant youre not eligible for rehiring
4811804 employers are put in a position where theyre charged with enforcing immigration but were very limited on the tools that are given to us to allow us to do that
4811805 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4811806 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside the country await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4811807 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region

4811851 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4811852 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question

4811869 it feels good to be here to be part of history

4811872 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more

4812061 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4812062 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4812063 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4812064 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4812069 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4812097 the russian president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4812098 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4812099 the document signed by the georgian president differs from the one which was agreed
4812100 it totally omits the introductory part saying that these principles are supported by russia and france and calling on all sides to sign them
4812101 additional numbers of monitors should observe the security zone we will carry out our obligations under the deal depending on how other parties carry them out
4812102 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority

4812106 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4812107 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4812108 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4812109 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4812110 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4812116 michael phelps is the greatest ever there is no doubt about that
4812117 he would have been first in the race no matter what the question was whether he shared first place

4812121 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4812122 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4812123 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4812124 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4812125 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4812126 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4812127 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4812128 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4812129 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4812130 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4812131 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4812132 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4812133 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4812134 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4812135 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4812136 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4812137 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4812138 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4812139 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4812140 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4812141 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

4812144 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4812145 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4812146 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4812147 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4812148 das hat mir sehr gut getan vor allem weil ich im vergleich zu meinen teamkollegen noch gar nicht so weit bin
4812149 in der ein oder anderen situation merkt man das schon
4812150 nat rlich werden solche aussagen nach zwei tore bel chelt aber ich sehe bei mir noch luft nach oben
4812151 es war ein sch nes spiel wir haben gut kombiniert und sind als mannschaft stark aufgetreten
4812152 es ist schade dass so viele stammspieler zum saisonstart verletzt sind aber wir konnten alle sehr gut ersetzen nur wenn eine mannschaft funktioniert kann man solche ausf lle verkraften
4812153 jeder wei dass einige mannschaften stark aufger stet haben und nun sehr gut aufgestellt sind aber das sind wir auch wichtig ist dass wir stark starten und den willen haben zu gewinnen
4812154 der wille und der zusammenhalt in der mannschaft stimmen einfach wenn wir weiter so als team agieren k nnen wir sehr erfolgreich in dieser saison sein

4812178 babymoons were very expensive and enjoyed by only those who could afford to spend 1 000 a night in a hotel since the concept has trickled down to bed and breakfasts as well as small inns theyre affordable for everyone
4812179 we wanted to visit someplace on our wish list before the baby was born
4812180 the boston area provided a good mix of culture as well as the beach we were thrilled for this opportunity to travel before our lives would be changed forever
4812181 babymoons are all about nurturing yourself and your relationship rather than seeing the sites
4812182 while babymoons are traditionally taken by first time parents were finding that its the second and third time parents who also take them and truly appreciate the time away
4812183 theyre a little older with more disposable income and probably traveled the world
4812184 these parents want to take one last trip before their baby is born and they become really grounded
4812185 it can simply be a weekend at a spa where the mom to be can be spoiled and indulged
4812186 expectant couples are looking primarily for resorts where they can get the ultimate in pampering
4812187 interestingly im also arranging some post baby trips for couples who want to travel with their newborns they know that traveling with an infant is easier when the baby isnt crawling or walking so im planning trips for them some as far away as hawaii even before their baby is born
4812188 your doctor may be interested in the kind of technique used before giving his or her approval
4812189 pregnant women should not fly past 28 weeks as changes in the barometric pressure in the airplane cabin can bring on uterine contractions
4812190 its also easier for women who are pregnant for the first time to travel as their labors will most likely be longer than with subsequent pregnancies giving them more time to get to the hospital in case of early labor
4812191 since it was summer we also didnt want to go somewhere really hot
4812192 we did a lot of online research and selected the captain ferris house in south yarmouth a bed and breakfast on the cape the inn recommended a ferry ride to nantucket which gave us a chance to take in the breathtaking coast and enjoy the local crowd
4812193 the cape cod potato chip factory in hyannis is a must for any pregnant woman who loves crunchy salty treats
4812194 this is the kind of thing were seeing over and over again
4812195 inventory is shrinking and the prices are escalating supply and demand
4812196 with todays environment of low fares and high fuel all airlines are having a difficult time justifying the economics of flying to leisure markets such as some destinations in florida
4812197 any destination that isnt up by 10 percent is a good buy in this market
4812198 your store is completely disorganized and unable to put on a party
4812199 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4812200 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4812201 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4812202 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4812203 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4812204 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4812205 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4812206 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4812207 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4812208 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy
4812209 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4812210 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4812211 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4812212 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4812213 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4812214 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few

4812217 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4812218 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4812219 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4812220 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4812221 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4812222 not really we live together so its no big deal

4812230 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades
4812231 i met him and admired his music his unique singing voice was loved by so many people
4812232 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world
4812233 he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
4812234 ronnie is like the king of ireland and we are his subjects
4812235 fue como si hubi semos ganado la medalla de oro
4812236 nuestra uni n y nuestra determinaci n marcaron la diferencia
4812237 no creo que este partido nos haya ense ado una lecci n m s bien pienso que es un ejemplo de c mo podemos sobreponernos a la adversidad
4812238 el juega as haciendo bromas ri ndose y tratando de desconcentrar al rival
4812239 pero en el tercer set cuando nos pusimos 11 10 el se descontrol
4812240 fue como si hubi semos ganado la medalla de oro
4812241 nuestra uni n y nuestra determinaci n marcaron la diferencia
4812242 no creo que este partido nos haya ense ado una lecci n m s bien pienso que es un ejemplo de c mo podemos sobreponernos a la adversidad

4812245 yo no quiero blanquearme yo vivo orgulloso de ser como soy solamente quiero dejar de ser negro por un tiempo para ver qu piensan los dem s para ver c mo me tratan con qu cara me miran para comprobar si el problema es mi color o soy yo pero nicamente aceptar a cambiarme si me garantizan que pueda volver a ser negro

4812247 digamos que lo normal en europa cuando jugu en el parma y en el newcastle no faltaban los insultos y ese grito desde las tribunas imitando a los gorilas pero no me acuerdo de muchos casos concretos porque uno como que se acostumbra

4812249 si yo voy a la c rcel por este problema me ahorco
4812250 me he puesto a hacer tonter as para dejar de estar nerviosa y al ganar grit a mi madre hay que ir a por todas a por el oro porque el paso que hemos dado es el m s dif cil ha sido muy duro y hemos trabajado mucho
4812251 creo que ha sido el partido m s complicado ambientalmente al entrar fue impactante la pista estaba llena pero ya nos lo advirtieron
4812252 me alegro que viniera a vernos es bonito ver la gente que te apoya espero que haya una celebraci n doble para el tenis espa ol
4812253 el deporte femenino est a n un paso por detr s del masculino por eso una medalla ol mpica tiene m s repercusi n que un grand slam en el dobles claro lo vimos cuando ganamos roland garros
4812254 estamos en la final y hay que salir como si fu ramos a disputar otro torneo
4812255 nos hemos quitado un peso de encima con esta victoria que parec a que no iba a llegar nunca hemos salido muy concentrados en el partido y hemos jugado bien nosotros siempre hemos mantenido presente el sue o de la clasificaci n y ahora todav a es posible
4812256 jap n tiene un juego muy t ctico y fastidioso y ha sido complicado ganarles han sido tres sets muy ajustados pero hemos sabido encontrar el camino de la victoria
4812257 nuestra intenci n es salir a ganar a los b lgaros y despu s si lo conseguimos ya veremos lo que pasa queremos que por nosotros no quede
4812258 bulgaria es un equipo muy alto con un buen servicio y mejor bloqueo pero que no est pasando por su mejor momento y nosotros vamos a tratar de aprovecharlo
4812259 nuevamente nuestro campe n jefferson nos llena de gloria y orgullo as que felicitaciones a jefferson
4812260 rompe ese estigma de derrotismo de que no podemos tener presencia a nivel mundial lo destroza a ese estigma y demuestra que los ecuatorianos somos capaces de lo que nos proponemos

4812266 cuando se tienen las cosas m s claras todo funciona
4812267 hablar y dejar todo claro ayuda a que cada uno haga mejor su trabajo somos personas y podemos solucionar las cosas porque todo funciona cuando todo el mundo lo tiene claro
4812268 me da rabia porque sabemos que tenemos el nivel que exige esta competici n los partidos anteriores te hacen coger el ritmo y hoy se demostr con nuestro juego hablamos mucho en las ltimas horas y hoy nos dio fruto
4812269 a pesar de no tener ninguna victoria hasta ahora no est bamos teniendo una mala competici n perdimos 2 3 contra estados unidos y contra china y quiz merecimos m s en los dos partidos
4812270 aqu no somos ni andy ni hary ni cedeno somos un equipo con un pa s entero detr s y tenemos que dar lo mejor de nosotros mismos
4812271 casi no hab a tocado el bal n antes del gol pero un atacante siempre debe estar preparado
4812272 hemos venido aqu a por la medalla de oro lo dem s no importa
4812273 me da lo mismo la marca que sea pero s lo una
4812274 ha sido un d a muy malo pero hemos vivido d as como estos aunque no tan malos porque nunca hab a quedado en ltima posici n tampoco toda la culpa es m a en estos momentos es evidente la respuesta son los neum ticos eso est claro y todo el mundo lo ha visto los michelin no est n a la altura pero soy un profesional y me debo a yamaha y por lo tanto me debo a michelin y sigo confiando en ellos
4812275 hemos visto que no al contrario pues vamos peor en seco estoy un poco m s entusiasmado podemos hacer algo relativamente pero salgo el ltimo para acabar entre los diez primeros ser importante salir bien
4812276 no he temido por no correr porque la parrilla es muy peque a si ma ana s lo saliesen quince pilotos no ser a positivo para el campeonato durante los entrenamientos he decidido no arriesgar m s y no salir a la pista porque iba jug ndomela
4812277 los bryan ya nos advirtieron que el ambiente estaba caliente
4812278 yo ya estaba preparada porque los bryan cuando termin su partido ya me lo hab an avisado me dijeron que el ambiente estaba calentito pero los espa oles aunque eran menos tambi n se han dejado notar y nos han ayudado eso ha sido una ilusi n muy grande porque participas en los juegos por tu pa s y es agradable ver como vibran contigo
4812279 no me conformo con la plata que en atenas fue amarga y llor mucho tras perder el oro no quiero vivir lo mismo
4812280 hemos logrado la mitad del objetivo nos falta la otra mitad la final el oro pero ya esto es un reconocimiento al trabajo que ya empez con la conquista de roland garros
4812281 las williams son unas adversarias peligrosas ya perdimos en wimbledon con ellas y despu s le dije a anabel medina que a lo mejor eso nos serv a de experiencia para los juegos vamos a ver tienen un servicio muy potente sobre todo son dos jugadoras de individuales pero con un gran potencial juntas espero que la derrota de wimbledon se cambie por el oro
4812282 cuando lleg el momento de los 800 decid darlo todo fui combativa me super a mi misma estos 800 metros me dieron el r cord sudamericano gracias a dios

4812284 all sponsorship and multimedia rights for um athletics including coaches television shows certain televised events corporate hospitality print sponsorships and athletic event marketing
4812285 we felt confident when we made the move because we had a great university and good tradition in our football program
4812286 we did well when we went to division i aa and then the crowning jewel was moving to i a there is no doubt that it has paid off for our team but especially for the university
4812287 were proud of the progress weve made especially going to two bowl games in four years
4812288 now we want to move toward getting a home and home series with an sec or acc team
4812289 we would love to play in jordan hare or bryant denny stadium
4812290 but thats probably not going to happen in the foreseeable future its political more than anything and you hear the argument that those schools have nothing to gain and everything to lose by playing us i dont blame them but we would sure relish that opportunity
4812291 i played so great in college i was drafted ahead of larry bird
4812292 its not like we were trying to send a statement
4812293 as a student athlete you want to play teams that you kind of grow up idolizing and we just kind of thought itd be a neat experience
4812294 americans who said eloquent speeches were the most important factor
4812295 ask not what your country can do for you but what you should do for your country
4812296 ha sido uno de esos partidos en los que no consegu amos encontrar el modo de resolver la selecci n camerunesa es muy potente y vamos a tener que eliminar a m s equipos muy buenos si queremos ganar el oro
4812297 we just are not in a position to move up right now
4812298 so many teams in the football championship subdivision are constantly talking about it
4812299 at this point its just not a priority for us a priority for me
4812300 sometimes you kind of wish you had the answers but theres no reason for us to do anything right now because of our health and where were at right now
4812301 people say well what happens if we go 4 7
4812302 i chose to go to montana because first i wanted to go somewhere where i felt wanted
4812303 second i had the opportunity to play as a true freshman and i wanted to win
4812304 bet it favors at least 10 to 1 to stay where were at
4812305 id like to see our basketball programs get into a higher profile basketball conference so they would have a chance for a 6 or 7 seed in the ncaa tournament as it is in the big sky we were lucky to get a 12 a few years back and a 14 to 16 is the norm
4812306 obviously we wouldve liked to have been more competitive in our revenue sports
4812307 in the past ten years we didnt do the things we needed to do to prepare to be in this league
4812308 from 1982 until 2004 this athletic program did not do one facility enhancement had they been preparing for success over that twenty year span it wouldve been a lot easier
4812309 say that we havent spent more than one second trying to decide whether were going to move up in the near foreseeable future
4812310 right now you do your best to get your facilities in place because you cant be running scared
4812311 we will continue to improve facilities build the program and do our best to make um athletics the special place it has become knowing that some day we might have to make a decision that will affect the future of our athletics program and its fans
4812312 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4812313 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4812314 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4812315 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4812316 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4812317 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4812318 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4812319 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4812320 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4812321 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4812322 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4812323 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4812324 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4812325 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4812326 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4812327 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4812328 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4812329 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4812330 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4812331 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4812332 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4812333 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4812334 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4812335 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4812336 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4812337 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4812338 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4812339 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4812340 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4812341 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4812342 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4812343 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4812344 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4812345 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4812346 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4812347 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4812348 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4812349 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4812350 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4812351 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4812352 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4812353 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4812354 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4812355 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
4812356 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic
4812357 liberals are meaner cheaper more willing to steal than conservatives
4812358 so what is he saying theyre the white party and were the black party
4812359 we are the black party and republicans are the white party
4812360 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4812361 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4812362 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination
4812363 we used to be young but suddenly were not our thighs have gone wide but we used to be hot wubyah wubyah wubyah
4812364 how i stopped raising my children and started raising h
4812365 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4812366 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4812367 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4812368 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4812369 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4812370 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4812371 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4812372 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4812373 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4812374 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4812375 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4812376 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4812377 it is even more important now for people to have a professional looking resume since theres so much competition
4812378 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4812379 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4812380 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4812381 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4812382 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4812383 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4812384 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4812385 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4812386 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4812387 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4812388 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4812389 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4812390 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4812391 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4812392 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4812393 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4812394 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4812395 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4812396 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault
4812397 any time something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up
4812398 everything there is to know about me has been in the media ad nauseam
4812399 there are probably things out there about me that even i dont know
4812400 i lost the election in 2004 thanks to a certain group of people in the south end of the county
4812401 i think it was something that was planned ahead of time
4812402 things went from bad to worse to much worse it began my hell to be honest with you
4812403 i chose the touch screen voting machines they were the only equipment that every voter regardless of disability could use
4812404 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4812405 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4812406 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4812407 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4812408 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4812409 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4812410 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4812411 siempre voy a por m s en sta esta es nuestra prueba

4812419 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4812420 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4812421 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4812422 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4812423 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4812424 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4812425 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4812426 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4812427 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4812428 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4812429 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4812430 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4812431 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4812432 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4812433 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4812434 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4812435 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4812436 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4812437 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4812438 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4812439 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4812440 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4812441 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4812442 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4812443 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4812444 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4812445 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4812446 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4812447 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4812448 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4812449 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4812450 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4812451 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4812452 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4812453 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4812454 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4812455 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4812456 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4812457 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4812458 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
4812459 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
4812460 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4812461 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4812462 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4812463 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4812464 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4812465 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4812466 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4812467 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4812468 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4812469 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4812470 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4812471 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4812472 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4812473 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4812474 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4812475 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4812476 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4812477 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4812478 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4812479 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4812480 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4812481 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4812482 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4812483 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4812484 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4812485 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4812486 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4812487 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4812488 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4812489 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4812490 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4812491 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4812492 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4812493 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4812494 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4812495 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4812496 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4812497 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4812498 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4812499 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4812500 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4812501 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4812502 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4812503 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4812504 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4812505 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4812506 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4812507 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4812508 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4812509 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4812510 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4812511 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4812512 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4812513 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4812514 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4812515 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4812516 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4812517 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4812518 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4812519 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4812520 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4812521 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4812522 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4812523 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4812524 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4812525 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4812526 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4812527 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4812528 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4812529 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4812530 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4812531 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4812532 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4812533 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4812534 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4812535 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4812536 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4812537 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4812538 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4812539 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4812540 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4812541 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4812542 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4812543 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4812544 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4812545 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4812546 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4812547 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4812548 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4812549 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4812550 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4812551 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4812552 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4812553 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4812554 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4812555 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4812556 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4812557 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4812558 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4812559 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4812560 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4812561 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4812562 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4812563 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
4812564 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
4812565 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
4812566 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
4812567 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
4812568 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
4812569 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4812570 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4812571 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4812572 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4812573 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4812574 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4812575 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4812576 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4812577 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4812578 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4812579 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4812580 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4812581 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4812582 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4812583 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4812584 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4812585 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4812586 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4812587 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4812588 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4812589 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4812590 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4812591 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4812592 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4812593 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4812594 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4812595 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4812596 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4812597 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4812598 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4812599 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4812600 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4812601 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4812602 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4812603 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4812604 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4812605 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4812606 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4812607 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4812608 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4812609 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4812610 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4812611 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4812612 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4812613 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4812614 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4812615 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4812616 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4812617 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4812618 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4812619 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4812620 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4812621 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4812622 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4812623 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4812624 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4812625 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4812626 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4812627 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4812628 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4812629 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4812630 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4812631 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4812632 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4812633 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4812634 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4812635 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4812636 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4812637 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4812638 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4812639 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4812640 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4812641 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4812642 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4812643 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4812644 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4812645 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4812646 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4812647 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4812648 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4812649 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4812650 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4812651 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4812652 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4812653 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4812654 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4812655 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4812656 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4812657 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4812658 the real cool down will probably be felt on monday
4812659 the high the last three days was 103 but if you think about it thats not really extreme it probably feels worse because it had been so pleasant beforehand
4812660 but the little heat wave in mid july sort of tweaked the average the second half of the month was below normal
4812661 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4812662 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4812663 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4812664 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4812665 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4812666 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4812667 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4812668 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4812669 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4812670 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4812671 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4812672 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4812673 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4812674 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4812675 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4812676 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4812677 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4812678 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4812679 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4812680 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4812681 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4812682 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4812683 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4812684 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4812685 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4812686 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4812687 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4812688 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4812689 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4812690 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4812691 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4812692 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4812693 for the first time since 1991 russia has used military force against a sovereign state in the post soviet area the world will not be the same a new phenomenon is unfolding in front or our eyes a re emerging power that is willing to use force to guarantee its interests the west does not know how to respond
4812694 the georgia crisis shows that russia is in the process of testing how far it can go
4812695 this is part of a much bigger geopolitical game it is time for the europeans to decide what kind of influence it wants in the former soviet states that is the biggest strategic challenge the e u now faces
4812696 weve got a lot of work in front of us
4812697 some players only started training very late after euro 2008
4812698 i played well on the first nine holes but i missed a few fairways on the last nine
4812699 i think ive put myself a little bit too far back but if i win tomorrow ill change my mind about taking next week off
4812700 i want to give myself every chance of course you can feel pressure playing at home but i think its more inspirational
4812701 six guys could win it its just lovely to be in contention going into the final round
4812702 its awesome to be this fast right out of the box
4812703 we always talk about bragging rights here for ford motor company and roush and everybody this is a really big racetrack for us hopefully this thing will race like it qualified
4812704 i cant explain it the advantage for the freestyle is probably now for anky
4812705 im disappointed by my stupid mistakes but i have a real good freestyle and i dont give up until the end
4812706 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4812707 we will be gone at the end of the year
4812708 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4812709 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4812710 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4812711 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4812712 he got in a fright and it took me a while to get him back on track and then he continued without problems

4812773 they the diocesan authorities and the trustees of the diocese of leeds will have to decide what happens to it then whether it gets sold and so on
4812774 i am conscious of those among you who have invested so much of your lives and energy into these parishes which will no longer exist i am aware of your pain and your sense of bereavement at this time i believe these changes however to be necessary in order to put the church on a better footing to meet the missionary needs both of the present day and of the years to come
4812775 as you are aware the style of liturgy here at st johns is a little different from many of the surrounding parishes indeed radically different from st benedicts next door
4812776 we realise that there are those who think that the style of liturgy here has been imposed on us by fr mark this is patently untrue as a community we are wholeheartedly behind fr mark in his mission to serve christ his church and his people the parishioners comments appended to this proposal are genuine and heartfelt
4812777 he the bishop then opened a major period of consultation with all the parishioners in the pontefract and wakefield deaneries in september last year which ran until the end of november
4812778 he worked hard through the distribution of dvds the use of the website and the catholic post to put forward his reasons for adjusting the structures of his diocese and invited suggestions to ameliorate his proposals no such suggestions were brought forward this was announced in his pastoral letter of trinity sunday which described the changes he needs to make
4812779 take the red ones ive never been disappointed by the red ones
4812780 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
4812781 it is disappointing to see howard dean trying to use gender and race to divide voters
4812782 his comments are insulting inappropriate and have no place in this election
4812783 rejected from civil service positions at the justice department white house press corps hasnt asked perino about doj politicization

4812793 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4812794 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4812795 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4812796 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4812797 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4812798 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4812799 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4812800 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4812801 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4812802 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4812803 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4812804 we worked hard in pre season and it was rewarded with a win in this match
4812805 we have showed that we are an attacking threat and we have some strength in depth on the bench
4812806 this is a great platform on which we must now build for the first game of the season there is a lot of pressure but we delivered
4812807 its a particular shame that we led twice and still didnt win
4812808 we were caught sleeping and in those instances you get punished
4812809 i was saying to steve bruce before the game that ive made 19 other premier league managers pretty happy
4812810 ive been a manager for 20 years and ive usually looked down the list and been an outsider so now i know what it feels like to be the favourite ive just got to get on with it
4812811 we think we did pretty well in the second half and gave west ham a bit of a doing
4812812 their fans will go away thinking that wigan are a decent side
4812813 but were disappointed with the way we started we prided ourselves last season on being disciplined and hard to beat
4812814 we started very well but credit to hearts they made a game of it
4812815 i was pleased with our input but we were a little patchy just before and just after half time the penalty did it at the end it came when they were a little nervy
4812816 weve needed calm in the midfield everyone can see that hell be very important
4812817 well apply for a work permit and then we can only wait
4812818 we have an agreement with his representative and now we have to speak to davis
4812819 mendys a little magician in the midfield hes a new ray of light for us
4812820 we played a good game and took pole position with two early goals
4812821 the second half was less spectacular though i am happy with the performance after our midweek game and we are good condition physically
4812822 our organisation was still not 100 but i am happy with the three points
4812823 we had imagined quite a different start to the one we got we were unfortunately not at the races and were not able to counter schalke at the start of the game
4812824 it was typical that we conceded through two set pieces that was particularly annoying it showed that we still have a lot of work to do

4812876 i had her since i was fifteen and she was just this little bundle of brown and white speckled fur someone had dropped on the side of the road
4812877 she made it to twenty she was almost old enough to drink
4812878 she was drinking before i was legal chantal loved her beer
4812879 thats another reason i came out here its real hard for me to sleep without her on my pillow snoring in my ear

4812917 i think this is a knee jerk reaction to gordon campbells announcement that all the homeless will be taken care of
4812918 from a parks board perspective im happy to get people housed
4812919 but it just makes the point that you have to embarrass the government into action and thats how you get housed this could all be a dog and pony show
4812920 this isnt something that came about as a result of anything that happened in beijing theres always cynicism people dont realize how much work is put into finding housing
4812921 bc housing came in and told us were bringing new people in theres only one person on staff aside from the cleaner
4812922 its causing friction it puts a lot more responsibility on our staff without the resources
4812923 i have been living outside for 17 years so its going to be hard to live inside
4812924 i think gordon campbell got embarrassed in beijing for the homeless situation here

4812931 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their worldview and they want to hear it out

4812942 contrary to public perception it s not just college kids or bleeding edge internet users who are streaming videos
4812943 this creates a fantastic opportunity for advertisers to capitalize on what is now a mainstream audience
4812944 people want more than a two dimensional experience online and this powerful medium now reaches everyone with engaging and interesting content
4812945 it is impossible to counter the logic that paying 28 cents for a click on google by a targeted consumer who might engage in an electronic transaction is not preferred to paying 10 cents per reader for a national magazine print ad that might not be seen

4812999 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4813000 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4813001 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough

4813178 no treino t tico de hoje s bado j fizemos com que n o s o marques se aproxime dele mas o m rcio ara jo o pet
4813179 como o fluminense deve jogar com dois volantes e dois meias possivelmente o m rcio ara jo ter a fun o de jogar um pouco mais adiantado
4813180 o m rcio ara jo deve penetrar e estar pr ximo dele quando atacarmos e fazer a recomposi o bem r pida contra o botafogo tivemos no primeiro tempo uns tr s contra ataques muito bons e deixamos de aproveitar porque tinha s um homem isolado ou porque s vezes o passe n o foi bem feito estamos tentando corrigir isso
4813181 contra o botafogo a gente acabou marcando em bloco mais atr s j que recuava at pr ximo do meio campo nesse jogo com o fluminense acredito que a gente pode marcar quando estiver sem a bola ocupar espa o
4813182 at porque n s temos dois tr s jogadores que participam menos da marca o n o s o marcadores espec ficos tendo espa o menor para trabalhar na marca o seria melhor para eles
4813183 vamos marcar bem o fluminense que vem bem ofensivo e sair para jogar porque temos qualidade pelo lado direito temos marques frente com o renan um pouco mais preso porque puxa o contra ataque e sabe jogar

4813205 not only have these disruptions been cleared but it has also been categorically stated that free movement along the national highway will be ensured in fact there have been no bottlenecks after some initial disruptions for three to four days unfortunately due to calls for bandhs and other protests in the valley despite the fact that the highway is through there have been difficulties in full and free movement of goods and traffic
4813206 your excesses are shameful you are a part of this nation and you must support your nation in this difficult hour
4813207 therefore we will have to exercise great caution and display wisdom
4813208 during my sixty years of experience i have seen that whenever a mass movement arose here a few traitors altered its course and turned it in favour of india
4813209 but i assure you that this will not happen now and india will be told that there is no room left for it here
4813210 his martyrdom will certainly bear fruit and the kashmiri people will taste freedom
4813211 our struggle is not a hindu muslim conflict nor do we have any enmity with the people of india we believe in maintaining the geographical integrity of the state and want to carry our non muslim brothers along in our struggle
4813212 we have come to pay homage to the slain leader and other martyrs and i ask you not to despair because our goal is very close but we will have to move forward with strict discipline
4813213 the nation has risen united for its rights and on this occasion i counsel pro india leaders to distance themselves from indian councils by resigning their seats immediately and join the ranks of the movement
4813214 if they do not do so they will face social boycott by the masses
4813215 the opening of the srinagar muzaffarabad road is essential kashmiris must be able to drive on this route in their private vehicles and they must not require any permit except the state subject certificate
4813216 extensive consultations will also be held with the hurriyat g in this connection
4813217 this public movement has to safeguarded at all costs and the peaceful protest campaign has to be continued with strict discipline

4813245 it costs me 1 100 a week to feed the animals which i do not resent

4813250 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
4813251 actually the first time i actually heard of the ifl folding was when i was doing a taping for inside mma a couple of weeks back
4813252 they actually announced it on the show and thats when i found out
4813253 it really wasnt that tough just off the pure fact that with any business if your employers not really sound and they dont take very good business strategies i knew there were bigger and better things
4813254 if the ifl had the potential to go get a fedor emelianenko or a randy couture or a top 10 guy like an andrei arlovski then i would have been 10 times more happy but i knew that wasnt going to happen
4813255 i wouldnt be surprised if you even see me fighting with elitexc or something im always in talks with every organization the only organization that doesnt talk with fighters that want to talk with other organizations is the ufc
4813256 the biggest one for me is affliction it has the best heavyweights in the world for me the only way i can move up the ladder in the ranks is to beat the best in the world or the other way is to go to the ufc and have the ufc pr machine do the work for you and then you still dont fight anybody good
4813257 its just kind of the roger huerta type of thing like when ufc president dana white says im paying all of my fighters over 50 000 a year thats good if you work 20 years but you only work maybe six years so its not that good of a deal
4813258 if i could get fedor emelianenko first id take it
4813259 i want to be on the fast track the fast track to first is in a straight line instead of trying to go around
4813260 i think it would be a really good fight were both guys that are willing to bang with you but were also willing to go to the ground i think it would be an exciting fight just off the pure fact that i always tell people if fedor was 260 pounds he would look like me if i was 230 pounds i would look like him
4813261 just give paul buentello a warm up match just kind of like a freebie it looked like a glorified sparring match
4813262 youre going to see some good banging same from an entertainment standpoint
4813263 actually the fans actually know paul buentello from being in the ufc the pr machine everybody knows that pauls a guy thats legit if i can beat him then it kind of gives me a little more stature among the actual fans
4813264 the only people that kind of dont respect me or respect my ability is usually the fans
4813265 if youre a hardcore fan you know if youre the casual fan im slowly turning all those guys last time i fought i had guys out in the stands rubbing their bellies too its a cool thing

4813428 enquanto isso n o nos vamos desistir por isso de fato j estamos no mercosul mas falta essa passagem jur dica internacional que fundamental

4813431 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

4813458 youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything
4813459 the mall has something really positive to offer something that has nothing to do with shopping
4813460 i dont know thats what i moved there to find out
4813461 opaque gray oatmeal mixed with the contents of a lint trap
4813462 i felt this vacation like euphoria that ive never felt till then or since then
4813463 it was better for me than any nature walk ive every taken
4813464 but it only works if you dont bring any money or your cellphone
4813465 for so many people the mall was the first place they got to see the world
4813466 the first place they spent their own money the first place they met somebody who wasnt in their neighborhood the first time they saw things from music to fashion that previous to that their only connection to it had been on tv
4813467 were living on a planet thats going to hell in a handbag
4813468 at the mall you enter a condition of perfect climate control where its clean and orderly and you are not forced in any way to confront reality
4813469 we wanted to bring our child to have its birthday there we wanted to have the babys first steps in the mall
4813470 so intrigued by the apartment that they went to see it themselves
4813471 the panel has concluded that a presumption in favour of a community order is most likely to be appropriate in relation to the less serious offences of theft and dishonesty burglary and motoring offences where there may be clear advantages in requiring an offender to serve a sentence in the community

4813476 all lines of communication to the region are down and no further information is known at this time
4813477 the hospitals are packed and all the buildings have been evacuated
4813478 but the authorities dont tell us how bad it really is i think theres some kind of national pride going on
4813479 i was at the beverly hills hotel and i was lying on my sun lounger outside at night looking up then about 300 foot above me there was this square thing which just passed over my head silently and then shot off
4813480 the argument put forward by the government that large scale net immigration brings significant economic benefits is unconvincing we have found no evidence to support their position
4813481 we will have permanent pressure of people to move in our direction
4813482 there is no doubt whatever that the pressure will remain for half a century or more
4813483 this report is a welcome contribution to our huge immigration shake up and we are already acting on practically every single recommendation
4813484 it proves we were right to set up the independent migration advisory committee to tell us which workers our new australian style points system should keep out or let in
4813485 were glad to see the committee welcome the system as well as our ban on low skilled migration from outside
4813486 our points system will be enforced by a new border agency to give the
4813487 im not sure about getting 125 who knows for me i want to take it beyond that im very honoured to be in the same category as billy wright sir bobby charlton bobby moore and peter shilton
4813488 they are players i have always looked up to in my career but i want to take it beyond that
4813489 if coming off the substitutes bench means me carrying on in the squad of course i will i have been lucky for over 10 years to be in the starting xi quite a few times and of course things change
4813490 there are a lot of young players coming through good players and you have to accept sometimes that you are not going to start but you will accept anything if you are still part of the squad players have retired for
4813491 i am a very passionate person about playing for my country and i want that to continue as long as possible whether i am a squad player a substitute or a player who comes on and scores with a free kick
4813492 if i can play at the highest level i want to be a part of that still
4813493 there are plenty of young players coming through but i feel i can offer something its always better to look towards the future but still not overlook the past
4813494 we havent performed in competitions and its embarrassing to a certain extent after we have promised things and said how good we are
4813495 but we do have some of the most talented players in the world and its about fulfilling that potential now we have got a manager who knows how to get the best out of players
4813496 he is without doubt the right man for the job he has got his own ways he knows how to get teams playing thats what our country needs
4813497 we need to get the confidence back of the nation and start by playing some good games we have definitely got the right man for that
4813498 push up bras have become a wardrobe weapon for millions of women across the world
4813499 the underwear item not only makes women feel incredibly sexy but it creates the ultimate cleavage
4813500 im not surprised to see it in the top spot push up bras have revolutionised womens lingerie and remain a best seller
4813501 its good to see boot cut jeans and stilettos in the top five fashion inventions both are classic wardrobe items
4813502 as part of our settlement express newspapers have also agreed to pay damages by way of a donation of 550 000 to the fund that was established to help find madeleine we feel it is entirely appropriate that the search for madeleine will now benefit directly out of the wrongs committed against us as her parents we hope that the portuguese authorities lift our arguido status in the very near future so that everyone can focus on finding our beautiful little girl madeleine
4813503 express newspapers rightly acknowledge that we are innocent of all allegations that we may have been involved in madeleines abduction and we would like to reiterate that there is absolutely no evidence that madeleine is dead or has been seriously harmed we embarked on this course of action reluctantly indeed with a heavy heart as we did not wish the pursuit of it to become a distraction from our sole aim finding madeleine
4813504 the general theme of the articles was to suggest that mr and mrs mccann were responsible for the death of madeleine or that there were strong or reasonable grounds for so suspecting and that they had then disposed of her body and that they had then conspired to cover up their actions including by creating diversions to divert the polices attention away from evidence which would expose their guilt
4813505 many of these articles were published on the front pages of the newspapers and on their websites accompanied by sensational headlines
4813506 in addition to the allegations referred to above the daily star published further articles under the headlines maddie mum sold her and maddie sold by hard up mccanns which sought to allege that mr and mrs mccann had sold their daughter in order to ease their financial burdens a further article alleged that mr and mrs mccann were involved in swinging or wife swapping orgies

4813516 another example of a quiet wave of self censorship and cultural cowardice sweeping western art circles
4813517 this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community
4813518 at the same time the muslims want to kill me im pandering to them
4813519 when people talk about an offended muslim being the same as a violent muslim to me that sounds like racism

4813530 what russia destroys the eu and nato will help restore
4813531 just a few miles away there are still russian troops on the ground still doing damage
4813532 what ive heard is theres a real danger that the militias that are in the areas that the russians occupy may well be carrying out appalling atrocities
4813533 if atrocities have taken place they will be held to account for that

4813595 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life

4813597 when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates
4813598 once my condition had stabilized my interrogators resumed their work demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant pressed for more useful information i gave the names of the green bay packers offensive line and said they were members of my squadron when asked to identify future targets i simply recited the names of a number of north vietnamese cities that had already been bombed
4813599 for those who dont know the story were those nfl football players
4813600 that was the starting lineup of the green bay packers the first super bowl champions yes
4813601 concerns have been raised that if the controversy is taught and id is actually subjected to scientific criticism this may be more confrontational to students beliefs than most high school teachers feel is appropriate

4813616 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4813617 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4813618 it may seem like the perfect way to save calories and slash your sugar intake but studies show that diet drinkers actually weigh more than regular soda drinkers
4813619 the label may shout fat free and seem like a better alternative to chips but theyre made with refined white flour stripped of its vitamins and antioxidants theyre also dense so they pack a ton of carb calories for a very small amount and theyre not filling think of it this way one 15 ounce bag contains the equivalent of 24 slices of white bread
4813620 yes it has vitamins but at up to 200 calories per bottle 50 per serving with 4 servings per jug just one of these a day can cause a 20 pound weight gain in a years time if the calories arent burned off

4813663 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4813664 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4813665 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4813666 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4813667 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough

4813679 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4813680 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4813681 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century

4813683 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4813684 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences there have been universal concern within the eu the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4813685 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

4813766 i just saw the video last night of our illustrious prof shanahan i never took a class from bill but now i definatly know why he doesnt know how to communicate surely he knows the difference between debate and arguing arguing only leads to close the channels of communication in spite of his anti conformist ideals he has demonstrated his non committal to constructive communication for that inability he should not be teaching communication i could point out that he doesnt represent fhsu well or that hes tarnished the reputation of our debate team but i think the fundamentals suffice

4813778 people who are circumcised are not able to get aids
4813779 socially it is uniting and now it has also been proven medically that is gratifying and it is part and parcel of now the strategy for fighting aids

4813791 im doing good now it was nerve wrecking having to watch and sit around
4813792 i thought 51 41 was not going to be competitive enough however it turned out to be very competitive it was faster than all of the times in one of the other heats
4813793 i was in lane eight and youre out there by yourself and you feel like you are really running alone
4813794 i did not have anyone in seventh lane which made it even more deceiving to me i thought i was way out ahead but i really wasnt in the mix like i thought i was that was a little strategically error on my part
4813795 luckily it wasnt a slow heat because i would have been in the danger zone
4813796 i was already in the danger zone but at least i was at the top of the danger zone
4813797 i cant wait until i get my feet under me and get rolling
4813798 gee i just dont see it that way take a look at my analysis
4813799 i dont believe in ghosts and that kind of thing but i try to keep an open mind
4813800 ive never seen anything odd but ive heard strange noises but i always put them down to the fact its an old building
4813801 a number of cleaners have seen theyve seen someone going into the gents toilets but theres never been anyone there

4813804 we havent looked in depth as to what has gone on in the pub as we want to go in with an unbiased view

4813817 dare any of you having a matter against another go to court before the unrighteous and not before the saints do you not know that saints will judge the world and if the world will be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters do you not know that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge i say this to your shame
4813818 is it so that there is not a wise man among you not even one who will be able to judge between his brethren but brother goes to law against brother and that before unbelievers
4813819 now therefore it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another
4813820 why do you not rather accept wrong why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded no you yourselves do wrong and you do these things to your brethren
4813821 you were fine earlier and youve been crying tell me whats going on

4813825 did it ever occur to you that maybe i met someone else while you were gone or maybe i decided i wanted something different or even that maybe i just didnt want you anymore how many times do i have to say it before it sinks through that thick skull of yours
4813826 i just walked into my own department and asked a simple question

4813836 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4813837 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4813838 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4813839 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4813840 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4813841 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4813842 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4813843 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4813844 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4813845 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4813846 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4813847 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4813848 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4813849 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4813850 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4813851 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4813852 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4813853 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4813854 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4813855 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4813856 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4813857 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4813858 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4813859 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4813860 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4813861 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4813862 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4813863 mom why cant k c and i have those clothes too pleaseeee

4813875 arnold has to be the most determined and the most focused person ive met in my life and ive met people from about 106 different countries he has that challenge personality everything he said he was going to do he did
4813876 what impressed me most about arnold was that he was never afraid to ask questions i found that very enlightening about the man a lot of people never ask questions arnold searches for knowledge
4813877 okay get on with it weve been there done that several times already

4813892 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4813893 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4813894 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4813895 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4813896 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4813897 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4813898 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4813899 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4813900 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4813901 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4813902 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4813903 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4813904 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4813905 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4813906 establishmentarian religion serves to bless convene and otherwise hold a sacred umbrella over the community at large when consensus has to be built it is there to build it when a common goal has to be achieved it is there to hallow it nationally in the first part of the 20th century the presiding bishop of the episcopalians or the bishop of the methodists or the stated clerk of the presbyterians were there to do the job after world war ii a more interfaith approach came to the fore perhaps the greatest contribution of establishmentarianism in american history was to set its seal on the civil rights movement but the lesson mainstream religion took away from that era was not of its own role but of the prophetic one incarnated in martin luther king jr and ever since it is the image of the prophet not the priest that has mesmerized the imaginations of american religious leaders that goes of course for those evangelical leaders who modeling themselves on the black civil rights clergy they had once reviled created the religious right a generation ago
4813907 so who is the true prophet how do we decide
4813908 how can we know when a message has not been spoken by the lord
4813909 dont suppress the spirit and dont stifle those who have a word from the master on the other hand dont be gullible check out everything and keep only whats good
4813910 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4813911 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4813912 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4813913 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4813914 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4813915 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4813916 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4813917 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4813918 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4813919 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4813920 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4813921 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4813922 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4813923 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4813924 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4813925 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4813926 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4813927 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4813928 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4813929 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4813930 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4813931 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4813932 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4813933 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4813934 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4813935 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4813936 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4813937 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4813938 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4813939 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4813940 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4813941 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4813942 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4813943 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4813944 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4813945 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4813946 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4813947 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4813948 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4813949 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4813950 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4813951 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4813952 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4813953 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4813954 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4813955 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4813956 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4813957 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4813958 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4813959 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4813960 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4813961 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4813962 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4813963 im mai 2008 wurde an die dienstkr fte die bereits einen antrag gestellt haben rund 1000 dienstkr fte eine abschlagszahlung von rund 700 000 euro geleistet

4814032 we always tried to make games that anyone could pick up and play they may over time reveal a lot of structural and mechanical complexity but the first mission of more or less any rockstar game is very easy and engaging for a reason because new people playing the game have to be gently led into the world of 3d action games or open world racing games or whatever this is the way we try to cater for a mass market good games will usually sell and be popular bad games will struggle of any type or genre or style

4814115 this has created a challenging environment for our print and tv businesses which has been compounded by the current macro economic climate
4814116 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4814117 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4814118 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4814119 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4814120 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation

4814508 when coalition forces stood up this school they worked with the iraqis to set up goals they wanted to achieve within a certain amount of time

4814510 i feel proud to say im a lieutenant in the iraqi air force

4814516 the people of wasit need to know that the iraqi army is here to help maintain their safety and security and we are very fortunate to have our great friends the americans by our side in this mission
4814517 we began planning with our iraqi partners to take over the georgian mission as soon as we found out they may have to go home
4814518 brig gen abed was very supportive in sending iraqi army soldiers out to the different checkpoints to help fill the positions left by the georgians ensuring the safe and stable security situation in wasit remained the same
4814519 the relationships that we have fostered played a vital role in the cooperative effort to take on the immediate security mission in the province
4814520 the iraqi soldiers we have been working with have been very eager and professional in improving how they conduct their day to day operations
4814521 we were able to reposition our forces to enable the georgians to begin movement back to georgia in a very short period

4814780 yang berpendapat bahwa orang orang liberal adalah orang orang yang berpikir bahwa kekejaman merupakan hal yang paling buruk yang bisa dilakukan saya menggunakan kata ironis untuk menamakan orang orang yang menghadapi dengan kontingensi semua kepercayaan dan hasrat hasrat utamanya seseorang yang juga seorang historis dan nominalis yang mengabaikan ide bahwa semua kepercayaan sentral mengacu kembali pada sesuatu yang melampaui jangkauan ruang dan waktu
4814781 tidaklah dipikirkan sebagai pengakuan terhadap diri yang esensial di dalam semua manusia alih alih begitu solidaritas dipikirkan sebagai kemampuan untuk melihat semakin banyaknya perbedaan perbedaan tradisional dari suku agama ras adat istiadat dan sebagainya sebagai sesuatu yang tidak penting ketika dibandingkan keprihatinan terhadap kekejaman dan penghinaan
4814782 ia rorty dengan demikian berpengaruh dalam apa yang saya sebut sebagai lenyapnya kebaikan publik
4814783 adalah bahasa penciptaan diri individual bahasa dari ruang publik adalah bahasa dari penderitaan dan penghinaan bagaimana mengenali mereka siapa yang menderita paling besar dan bagaimana mereka dapat diringankan

4814785 novel film dan acara tv telah secara bertahap namun pasti menggantikan khotbah dan perjanjian sebagai prinsip untuk perubahan moral dan kemajuan
4814786 apa yang para pemikir romantik ekspresikan sebagai klaim bahwa imajinasi dan bukan akal budi adalah fakultas manusia yang paling utama
4814787 adalah suatu bentuk realisasi dari kemampuan orang untuk berbicara berbeda dan bukan berargumentasi secara baik yang sekaligus merupakan elemen utama perubahan budaya
4814788 mengubah cara kita berbicara dan dengan demikian mengubah apa yang ingin kita lakukan dan apa yang kita pikirkan tentang diri kita sendiri
4814789 sebuah kesadaran tentang sejarah manusia sebagai sejarah tentang metafora metafora yang diteruskan
4814790 akan membuat kita melihat para penyair dalam arti yang umum sebagai sang pencipta dunia dunia baru yang menajamkan bahasa bahasa baru dan sebagai barisan depan spesies spesies
4814791 dikutuk untuk menggunakan hidup sadar kita mencoba untuk melarikan diri dari kontingensi daripada seperti para penyair mengakui dan mengizinkan kontingensi
4814792 bagaimana kamu sampai pada pengetahuan atau bagaimana kita dapat sampai pada kebenaran
4814793 mengapa kita membicarakan pengetahuan dan kebenaran dengan cara cara yang kita gunakan sekarang
4814794 bakat yang yang luar biasa untuk membungkuk menghindar dan bersembunyi di balik asap
4814795 jika kita mencoba menarik kesimpulan penuh dari posisi seorang ateis yang konsisten
4814796 mari kita lihat apa yang terjadi jika kita mencoba dengan cara ini

4814831 it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations
4814832 in those days we were particularly strict about political balance but of course you could invite an opposition mp who were all labour during the time that i was there who was particularly plausible and attractive and put him up against a bigoted ineffective conservative and say that we had achieved political balance and in the same way you got your point over by choosing your subject and choosing the questions to ask because all the questions could be based on is it really just that such and such could happen
4814833 but if you look at whats happening in the region were continuing to see job losses in construction manufacturing and financial services and the losses are also continuing in retail trade its rather discouraging

4814859 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4814860 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4814861 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one

4814917 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4814918 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4814919 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4814920 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country

4815020 volem que qualsevol ciutad es converteixi en periodista i ens ajudi a difondre hist ries en text udio i v deo tot el material s revisat per la redacci abans de ser publicat nom s posem a portada els que som molt destacats
4815021 la gent no ha estat mai prou considerada com a font dinformaci el present i futur ens diu que el periodista t un paper important en la producci de la informaci per que ja no s l nic propietari daquesta
4815022 gent de qualsevol part del m n ens donava el seu punt de vista del per ode electoral
4815023 al principi eren una vintena i ara ja s n 60 i continuem amb lexperi ncia
4815024 amb el canvi hem incorporat dos elements diferenciadors 1 el reaprofitament de laudiovisual procedent de la televisi i la r dio que no s comparable a cap mitj digital del nostre pa s 2 lapertura a la participaci creant a portada
4815025 tant en aquest cas com en els comentaris a not cies tenim unes normes d s molt estrictes per assegurar una participaci de qualitat que s la que creiem que correspon als mitjans p blics
4815026 als estats units hi ha la mateixa febre per la participaci que a catalunya o a espanya
4815027 no obstant el que encara trobo a faltar s una connexi directe entre el periodista i el ciutad que envia la not cia no hi ha col laboraci que s el que crec que podria ser un canvi qualitatiu en la rutina period stica
4815028 apliquem el que anomenen periodisme en xarxa mirem la informaci que tenen els nostres periodistes la dels lectors i el que hi ha a internet sobre el tema despr s busquem la manera dinteractuar aquestes contribucions enriqueixen a tothom fins i tot els que nicament llegeixen
4815029 preferim potenciar els blogs on els nostres lectors opinen de manera m s reflexiva els comentaris s n pura vomitera un discurs irracional que no aporta res de nou
4815030 lusuari s lliure de dir la seva si es passa es penalitza com passa al carrer
4815031 no hi ha un equip dedicat especialment a la participaci sespera que cada periodista escolti i si s oport participi tamb en ells
4815032 aix s una moda vorem desapar ixer aquesta participaci o sinventar una nova f rmula
4815033 la participaci que sest fent ara no t cap sentit no sha plantejat com donar li vida ni com reaprofitar la li diuen al lector que parli per ning a les redaccions lescolta tinc la sensaci de que sels tracta com a hamsters no com a persones amb preocupacions i interessos particulars
4815034 nosaltres diferenciem crom ticament lespai dels usuaris de la informaci creada pels nostres periodistes
4815035 tot shi val si ho envia el lector a menys que toqui temes pornogr fics o clarament falsos
4815036 no coincideixo en deslligar la responsabilitat del mitj del que publica el lector
4815037 ning distingeix entre cirurgians professionals i ciutadans la gent que envia informaci no vol ser periodista el nostre problema s que estem fent mitjans de baixa qualitat que no es diferencien gaire del que fan els lectors
4815038 aixo del periodisme ciutad s la collonada m s gran que sha inventat els periodistes hem daportar m s qualitat informativa que un bloguer
4815039 s n una nfima part de la informaci de la xarxa en tot aquest temps no han innovat en res perqu tampoc mai han dedicat ni cinc c ntims en investigar com treballar a internet hi ha centenars diniciatives on es potencia la participaci de veritat i venen dexperi ncies ciutadanes
4815040 nom s dedico un 20 del meu temps a fer una ullada r pida als mitjans tradicionals hi ha molt bona informaci a internet al marge dells
4815041 el millor de les aportacions dels ciutadans s n noves ide es noves fonts i comentaris reflexius i no tant la publicaci del contingut informatiu
4815042 internet es la alternativa para dar una informaci n real de cuba

4815047 mitj de comunicaci n digital on els periodistes ciutadans informen de les sev es realitats
4815048 sha creat una xarxa social de periodistas ciutadans amb la intenci doferir not cies diferenciades que no subministren les ag ncies ni els mitjans tradicionals
4815049 creiem que el valor de la informaci saconsegueix amb la interacci de la gent la not cia comen a en els comentaris
4815050 escric el que els mitjans tradicionals no expliquen perqu no s not cia la meva satisfacci s saber que em llegeixen i interessa
4815051 ja tenim 2 000 usuaris registrats que han escrit m s de 2 500 hist ries nom s les millors 260 shan traslladat a portada
4815052 per qu fidelitza col laboracions m s valuoses exigim que els textos tinguin el mateix nivell professional que els dels nostres redactors
4815053 el nivell de participaci quan es demana qualitat s baix i sha danar animant
4815054 a les webs de tv3 i catalunya r dio fa anys que apostem per la interacci amb els usuaris lexperi ncia ens ha desmotrat que si fem una proposta atractiva responen
4815055 la clau est en incorporar les aportacions dels usuaris a la programaci televisiva fet que pot donar lloc a nous formats audiovisuals que fins fa poc eren inimaginables
4815056 el concepte de la programaci de les televisions tradicionals sest quedant obsolet la gent sest acostumant a veure episodis que poden seguir una freq ncia setmanal di ria o mensual
4815057 el 86 dels editors enquestats uns 700 creuen que en una d cada el consum majoritari de not cies es far via internet i per tel fon m bil
4815058 haurem de pensar menys com a periodistes i editors i m s com a antrop legs
4815059 totes les responsabilitats i control correspondran als autors i esperem incloure les opinions i punts de vista dels autors que han creat la seva reputaci a internet

4815079 i personally feel like it would have been a great opportunity for us to do some advertising because we have bars that are right across the street from the university
4815080 its kind of ridiculous to think that college students dont drink so to have advertisements from bars in the local area makes perfect sense
4815081 whoever photoshopped our poster must have done so at taser point with 3 minutes to fulfill their deranged obligations
4815082 the left side of my face seems to be melting off my skull i guess i am looking directly into the arc of the covenant are they going for a bells palsy thing here

4815086 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4815087 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4815088 i was in high school when she hit it big

4815091 keep up the great work i check your site very frequently
4815092 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement
4815093 come to a team that finished 5th a great manager happy fans has a full squad of great players a new stadium in the offing and had a great cup and euro run
4815094 come to everton desperate for players unhappy fans tragically bad in the transfer market this summer the manager hasnt signed a contract no stadium in the offing the old ceo quit there squad is so thin they had to put children on the bench and 2 defenders in midfeild
4815095 maybe after you finish it you can tell us how you liked it
4815096 dirty blond hair a skinny frame and clothes that always looked like hed stored them crumpled on the floor
4815097 i have a son who loves science fiction were going on a bit of a trip in the car and id like to get him a long book do you have any ideas
4815098 to help him come up with the questions to ask mccain and obama
4815099 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4815100 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4815101 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4815102 i absolutely cant believe that has happened i knew when i touched i had won and that was a great thing because i was just going for gold
4815103 i didnt expect that record at all it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time
4815104 i dont know where that last 250m came from i was in so much pain ive never been in that pain in my entire life
4815105 for the last four to five months our coach jurgen grobler has told us theres no one who can beat you but some days you dont feel like that
4815106 i didnt realise we were ahead until very close to the finish i just had a sniff that we could do it in the last 200m the last 10 15 strokes were phenomenal it was beyond skill it was just something primeval

4815110 even though taiwan enjoyed home field advantage many supporters were not optimistic about the teams chances especially when hung announced his final lineup composed of many young and inexperienced players but equipped with burning ambition and guided by hungs astute tactics the team of unproven youngsters eventually obtained respect both at home and abroad by making the publics wish of going to the upcoming olympics come true
4815111 its just like in history last night we lost to former colonial power japan and today we lost to the communist bandits
4815112 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
4815113 up through july we had seen weakness in italy greece spain and portugal and the investment communitys response was one of no big deal they are not the major growth regions anyway
4815114 but now theres signs of slowing in germany france and the united kingdom and nearly every demand side indicator is in retreat its a pronounced psychological shift no question
4815115 the us has no rational basis to be as committed to georgia as russia is and has very little moral standing to protest an invasion of a sovereign country
4815116 i was a little too mad at bush to express adequate sympathy for the plight of the georgians at first
4815117 russia is no longer the soviet union youd think conservatives would understand this distinction there is a difference between totalitarian states seeking world expansion and authoritarian petro states in demographic collapse bullying neighboring states because of perceived humiliations
4815118 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4815119 all you left wing bloggers who want to smear mr corsi
4815120 theres over 300 pages 700 footnotes and ill stand by the truth of every statement in this book
4815121 a large number of e mails were received from readers objecting that obama was not the messiah but rather the biblical antichrist prefigured in saint johns apocalypse
4815122 i had to read it about six times before i began to figure it out
4815123 why obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4815124 what is obama trying to hide and why would he do so
4815125 that obamas father was a polygamist and an alcoholic may or may not tell us much about obama
4815126 the document that was signed yesterday by mikheil saakashvili differs from the document that was agreed by presidents medvedev and sarkozy in moscow
4815127 so this issue has to be clarified through diplomatic channels
4815128 i have already stated that this withdrawal will take place when extra security measures have been put into place on the ground along the positions of the peacekeeping contingent
4815129 we insist that georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected
4815130 and moscow must honor its pledge to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4815131 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4815132 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4815133 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
4815134 very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia
4815135 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4815136 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4815137 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4815138 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals
4815139 ongelooflijk ik sta in de top tien van de wereld
4815140 ik heb het een beetje verkloot bij het speerwerpen bij het inwerpen gooide ik de speer over de 45 meter dan moet je dat in de wedstrijd zeker ook doen
4815141 shes also waaay soft and fuzzy i think she may be made of clouds clouds with a warm blooded heartbeat and other primal human goodness and she likes me she just wants me to be myself and share who we will become
4815142 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
4815143 i dont know how youve dealt with her nagging for so many years
4815144 although i am surprised that harry and ginny dont get more of her attention than you and ron
4815145 your mum went after ginny once a couple of years ago she started going on about living in sin and how she expected her little girl to settle down and start a family the entire time ginny just kept eating calmly while harry was wincing and turning red in the face when molly finished with her lecture however ginny just stated that she wasnt ready to get married and if the only options were marriage or breaking up with harry shed break up with him
4815146 of course not but that doesnt matter because the threat worked molly sputtered for several minutes trying to explain that she never wanted ginny to break up with harry she then told them that they shouldnt rush into anything if they werent ready to get married it was lovely to watch since that incident however ginnys been granted some sort of dispensation she gets no more grief about her personal life which means your mum has more time to focus on ron me and you i know ron tries to shield me from much of it but how to do you stand it charlie
4815147 well she is my mum so i have some natural immunity
4815148 im sure your disposition helps too being laid back and easy going must take some of the edge off
4815149 i suppose you dont get referred to as laid back very often
4815150 no i dont think that phrase springs to many peoples minds when they describe me
4815151 i might have a strategy that will work for you with mum at least it helps me when she really lays it on thick
4815152 is this some sort of secret dragon tamer skill for calming wild beasts
4815153 well women are much more vicious than your average dragon
4815154 you approach a woman when she is in the wrong mood and shell tear you apart no matter how gentle your touch or how much raw meat you chuck at her
4815155 it is a horrible personal failing but ive always been attracted to the fiery ones
4815156 naw couldnt yell at my mum instead i imagine telling her that ive just gotten my heart broken or that i was dating a great girl who recently got mauled by a dragon stories that will make her feel like shite for going off on me when it gets really bad i envision breaking down and crying at the dinner table because im worried that ill never find someone who really loves me
4815157 mind you i dont plan on ever tearing up over sunday brunch but just thinking about how i could respond helps me tune her out a bit
4815158 ill give it a try cant be any worse than just sitting there getting angry
4815159 i should have realised that you were a woman who enjoyed having a good plan
4815160 wouldnt it be wonderful if both ginny and hermione could have babies at the same time the children would end up at hogwarts together and be best of friends as well was cousins
4815161 what do i do now i dont think i can sit through many more family dinners pretending it doesnt bother me that im not pregnant
4815162 why dont you and ron come to romania the dragons will be breeding in a few weeks
4815163 and you think watching a bunch of dragons humping might inspire ron and me
4815164 annie i told you that it would make breakfast too awkward
4815165 his wife is an uptight swot though i mean seriously what kind of stick in the mud would choose to hang out with burlington all day when she could be working with the dragons
4815166 shes not uptight not really shes just interested in a diverse number of issues including how things run behind the scenes as well as on the ground
4815167 i would have thought by now luv that youd know i enjoy all types of women
4815168 he had his mind set on the same female that he was with last year but he failed to successfully attract her shes breeding with a younger welsh
4815169 she shouldnt have just tossed him aside because hes getting a bit older
4815170 ive volunteered to return to the reserve for two weeks at the beginning of march to conduct the ministrys biannual inventory
4815171 there is no medical explanation for why i cant get pregnant
4815172 i dont know i dont want to know i havent told ron about the tests
4815173 think about it for a few weeks im determined to have a baby and last spring proved we already have a connection
4815174 i know but maybe that means something genetically any child between me and one of rons brothers might as well be his maybe we shouldnt have stopped ourselves last april
4815175 im quite certain that abandoning ones sister in law in the face of possible danger breaks some sort of proper code of behaviour
4815176 why do we have to do this so late at night
4815177 a ministry representative was poking her nose around here today we need to move this stuff in case she comes back tomorrow and wants to inspect the closets
4815178 if the ministry hasnt figured out whats up before now i doubt some no name bureaucrat is going to uncover our operation
4815179 whats my problem whats my problem it shouldnt be any big mystery that my problem is you
4815180 what you have nothing to say now no more self righteous pronouncements
4815181 tell me this is more than just making a baby for you and ron
4815182 yo dont eat this fruit or uh youll die ok
4815183 not disobey god in what he tells us to do
4815184 each one of us and all of us are in a perfect state of constantly becoming perfectly imperfect in our own way
4815185 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4815186 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4815187 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4815188 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4815189 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4815190 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4815191 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4815192 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4815193 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4815194 its like an onion peel to get people to understand that these kids are still at risk
4815195 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4815196 we need to be able to be there for people who need us

4815203 the out building was approximately 4 500 square feet and was being used for storage and as a workshop summerland rcmp attended and it was determined that the fire was suspicious in nature
4815204 by the time we found out where he was it was too late he had been adopted by another family
4815205 they cant give me the name of the family that adopted chevy of course but they did contact them on friday and told them what had happened they gave the family my contact information and now i am just waiting hoping they will call me
4815206 i know that legally he belongs to this new family but i think its important that they know he wasnt abandoned or abused he is loved and we searched for him hes a great dog so im not surprised that some other family adopted him so fast but hes our dog and we miss him very much
4815207 i dont know if he just got out or if someone took him out i know he was found at a campground in peachland and thats how he came to be at the kelowna pound before being transferred to the spca
4815208 ill go on record saying it is a failure on the companys part my understanding is when chevys family moved from vancouver they were unable to remember what their password was which they needed to update the contact information on chevys chip the company wouldnt help them
4815209 they wouldnt give me any information about the old owners
4815210 im stepping down today after four years in charge of dublin
4815211 it certainly wasnt how we wished it to end today but thats football thats sport and we must accept it and move on
4815212 first how does this political choice play out for the marginalized second how does this political choice support global peace how did it come to be that we evangelicals have become the chief advocates of war of any demographic in the country we christians ought to be the hardest to convince we ought to require the highest burden of proof we ought to demand the most evidence before we support any military action the church is always a peace movement
4815213 it has not yet been decided if there will be an age limit on who can receive the pill
4815214 i sure am glad that things are good because they could be so much worse
4815215 wow i had it soooo good before if i get out of this i definitely wont go around taking everything for granted again life can improve
4815216 i think that without sadness happiness would have no meaning whatsoever
4815217 theyre in 6th grade and they dont even know the books of the bible
4815218 honestly i think that everyday life is a vision and that there is only a blurry line between imagination and reality
4815219 if you dont continuously focus on the mid term well also lose the short term game you regret what you did not do three years ago and you find yourself in deeper problems in the short term
4815220 targeted and focused searches based on specific intelligence and leads
4815221 aiyah bo pian nowadays very difficult to get good and reliable help leh
4815222 china huaneng is an established player with a strong track record in the power business its proposal through sinosing was the most attractive
4815223 it emerged as the winner based on clear considerations of price and acceptable commercial terms
4815224 in its goal to diversify its assets across geographies and technologies
4815225 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4815226 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4815227 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4815228 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4815229 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4815230 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4815231 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4815232 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4815233 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4815234 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4815235 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4815236 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4815237 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4815238 i was going to get patties at my local and just thinking that really the worst thing that anyone can say to someone these days is some shit like

4815240 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image

4815245 it is critical to have a better understanding of what is preventing women from using contraception consistently and correctly or even at all
4815246 the more we can remove the remaining barriers to consistent use the better we will be at ensuring that all women can avoid unwanted pregnancies and plan the children they want when they want them
4815247 mathematics and music have a strange connection music is the only art form where the form and the medium are the same mathematics is the only science where the methods and the subject are the same mathematics is the study of mathematics using mathematics music is only created and experienced as music thus there is a natural connection between mathematics and music both are experienced as pure objects of the brain and both have meaning outside of the brain only by artificial connections

4815257 yeah just because shes blue doesnt make her a peacock
4815258 current child support laws and regulations are deliberately or negligently skewed to maximize child support payments this is in contrast to a genuine calculation and sharing of the costs of raising children
4815259 the guidelines have resulted in a massive transfer of wealth a transfer unrelated to the purpose of child support child support payments have become a new tax a tax on being a father and divorced
4815260 this ignores the reality that there is a limit on the amount of money that can be reasonably expended on raising children
4815261 the degree of suffering that is going on in this country of non custodial parents is a disgrace
4815262 there is absolutely no accountability under the divorce act there must be accountability
4815263 eliminating the paying parents decision making role can devalue that parent in the eyes of the children the guidelines cause an involuntary transfer of familial authority from the paying parent to the state and through the state to the recipient parent
4815264 if you dont want to support a child use birth control or keep your pants zipped

4815270 all members of dpps work hard for our community and make a significant contribution to policing and the safety of our community
4815271 the fact that officers who attended the scene were also attacked is appalling and i am relieved that no one was injured
4815272 the people who are responsible for this have nothing to offer our society and such attacks achieve nothing
4815273 we can confirm that a petrol bomb was thrown at the shed at a property at the leckagh drive area of magherafelt at 1 30am yesterday morning
4815274 while attending the scene officers were attacked with stones and bricks
4815275 we started bad because of the long layoff and probably the players were looking at the team standing of nu they thought nu will just give the game to us
4815276 good thing we started being aggressive and defensive conscious we did what we were supposed to be doing in the first half its a good thing my players really responded well
4815277 we played good defense right from the start it was a total team effort
4815278 er hat sich irgendwie erschrocken da ging es dann nur noch um schadensbegrenzung danach ging es normal weiter aber da habe ich sehr viele punkte eingeb t an so einen erschrecker mit ihm kann ich mich nicht erinnern das ist schon jahre her
4815279 sehr zufrieden war kemmer die sich nun chancen auf bronze ausrechnen kann

4815281 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4815283 more of them are likely to have the baby rather than having an abortion compared to 1990
4815284 there have been some changes in behavioral and contraceptive use among teenagers who are sexually active
4815285 there is some evidence that contraceptive use for example at first intercourse and at most recent intercourse was increasing among teenagers through 2002
4815286 among older women birth rates have been going up thats something we have been watching for 20 to 30 years
4815287 i guess maybe it is changes in attitude and a willingness to have children when you are not married and that kind of thing
4815288 when you go to jamaica and you see how track and field is respected in the country they should have the olympic champion
4815289 they have given such gifts to the sprint world whether it be to the united kingdom or whoever
4815290 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
4815291 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
4815292 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so
4815293 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4815294 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4815295 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4815296 i havent managed to make the best time on every occasion but the last couple of times i have started to ease up on the gas a little with the next rally in mind
4815297 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4815298 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4815299 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4815300 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4815301 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4815302 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4815303 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4815304 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4815305 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4815306 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy
4815307 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4815308 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4815309 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4815310 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4815311 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4815312 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4815313 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4815314 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
4815315 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
4815316 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4815317 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4815318 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4815319 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4815320 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4815321 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4815322 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4815323 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4815324 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4815325 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4815326 brightening up this decidedly gloomy summer is illustrator james jarvis new installation at niketown in london a giant bird features in his window display for the oxford street store while inside the foyer theres also an eight panel vinyl artwork with the same avian character donning his nike windrunner jacket beanie brownjohn at make stuff sculpted the figure in the window display and free posters relating to the designs may still be available from the store youll have to run like the wind to get one mind
4815327 qatar as a state of strategic weigh in the region seeks to sponsor the mediation between hamas and fatah to end the internal split and reunite the two wings of palestine
4815328 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4815329 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4815330 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4815331 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup
4815332 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
4815333 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
4815334 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4815335 we tried to stick together as a group i tried to lead the team out but it was nearly impossible
4815336 the thing that saved us was we were prepared and we had the right equipment there was an enormous amount of snow it was burying and suffocating us
4815337 i jumped in the chopper and i could feel the tears starting and when we hit the ground thats when the tears really started to flow
4815338 at every point where there was danger like when we were climbing through loose snow and trying to make it to the hut my limits were tested
4815339 when you start going down to your neck in snow you know that you cant go any further
4815340 when we knew we couldnt get through to the hut and had to activate the beacon i knew that we were in trouble
4815341 they decided to hunker down and keep each other warm they did the right thing
4815342 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
4815343 as soon as i saw i had the field covered and i knew i would win i was very happy and i started to celebrate
4815344 i havent seen the replay so i really cant comment
4815345 i just came here to prove that im the best in the world and i did that
4815346 i dont think anybody could have been him with a run like that today
4815347 it was really tough but i am not afraid of any race

4815388 the company involved in the super exciting haynesville shale region which could be one of the largest domestic on shore natural gas fields ever
4815389 the stock has been coming on lately as more investors learn about the companys potential in the haynesville shale region
4815390 discovered in march of this year the haynesville field according to energy and capital could conservatively hold 168 trillion cubic feet of natural gas chesapeake energy has declared haynesville the most important find in its 19 year history
4815391 there was always a notion that a big find was in the space that the company currently owns 2 700 acres but when it was first explored back in the 1950 crude oil prices were much lower and there was no technology to get to the natural gas
4815392 recently the company announced a joint venture with petrohawk which until recently had the hottest stock in the entire market
4815393 most folks dont realize that there is a gold rush in domestic resources going on right now in part to new technologies to find and drill for crude oil and natural gas this has created a fantastic problem of no rigs and too few pipelines
4815394 this makes the deal with petrohawk so special another element to the arrangement is the fact that petrohawk will pay all expenses associated with drilling the first well the financial arrangement will be 60 40 with mainland getting the latter
4815395 that is a very favorable ratio for a junior resource company and it means they may not have to go to the public for additional funding that would dilute present shareholders there are some analysts that think this is a 9 stock but i think it could be a 13 stock by the end of this year
4815396 i interviewed the ceo of petrohawk in june when i anchored cavuto on the fox business network and natural gas is going to play a prominent role in our energy use for decades to come
4815397 in fact i spent time with t boone pickens last month in wyoming and his plan is more about natural gas to run our cars than wind mills to power our electric grid i also spoke with the ceo of mainland and his optimism is clear
4815398 of course this is a small cap play and cash flow may not begin until late in the year so there are greater than average risks
4815399 that may explain why the shorts have been on the attack right now im told there is a 20 million share naked short position that is a significant amount of folks that may have to cover in a hurry
4815400 ahora afirm bush rusia necesita hacer honor a este acuerdo retirar sus fuerzas de georgia y por supuesto poner fin a sus operaciones militares
4815401 el tema principal es que la lucha de rusia por las regiones de osetia y abjasia no debe formar parte del futuro de georgia estas regiones son parte de georgia y la comunidad internacional ha repetido hasta la saciedad que seguir n si ndolo
4815402 estas resoluciones est n basadas en la premisa de que osetia del sur y abjasia permanecen dentro de las fronteras de georgia y que cualquier conflicto internacional sobre este tema se debe resolver mediante negociaciones internacionales
4815403 los suministros est n siendo repartidos entre el pueblo georgiano y en los pr ximos d as llegar n m s
4815404 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4815405 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4815406 para comenzar a reparar las relaciones con eeuu europa y otras naciones y para comenzar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo rusia debe actuar y poner fin a esta crisis

4815413 el 60 por ciento de la superficie forestal valenciana es de titularidad privada
4815414 incluya una reducci n de tres millones de euros en las ayudas a propietarios privados y a ayuntamientos para la mejora del medio forestal
4815415 est claro que el conseller garc a ant n ha decidido abandonar a la buena voluntad de los propietarios el cuidado y la preservaci n de los montes valencianos despreciando el hecho de que son insustituibles para mantener el equilibrio ecol gico del territorio y para protegerlo de amenazas tan graves como la desertificaci n o el cambio clim tico
4815416 me he puesto a hacer tonter as para dejar de estar nerviosa y al ganar grit a mi madre hay que ir a por todas a por el oro porque el paso que hemos dado es el m s dif cil ha sido muy duro y hemos trabajado mucho

4815422 el plan no prev un nuevo estatus pol tico de abjasia y osetia del sur pues su contexto se basa en las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu que reconocen la integridad territorial de georgia

4815454 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4815455 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4815456 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4815457 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4815458 to have limited patrols in a prescribed area within the zone of conflict not to go into georgian urban areas not to tie up the highway
4815459 now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the ceasefire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4815460 president sarkozy told me that president medvedev had told him that the minute georgian president mikheil saakashvili signed that document russian forces would begin to withdraw
4815461 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4815462 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4815463 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4815464 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about
4815465 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern

4815471 no ancora presto una semplice questione matematica 25 punti non mi permettono di poter arrivare dietro a stoner da qui a fine campionato altrimenti perderei il titolo
4815472 questa pista totalmente differente da laguna molto larga e con rettilinei molto lunghi per cui almeno in linea teorica no per il divario da stoner effettivamente minore quindi potrebbe anche essere certo che per lottare con lui dobbiamo essere perfetti non sbagliare nulla soprattutto in partenza se dovessi perdere qualche posizione sarebbe dura poi recuperare su casey che velocissimo sin dalla prima curva
4815473 beh innanzitutto a laguna non avevo alcuna tattica sono riuscito a partire bene e poi essendo efficace in frenata ho sfruttato al massimo questo aspetto per cercare di stargli davanti lui qui un po pi veloce di me in un determinato settore della pista il t2 se riusciremo a limare un decimo in quel punto ce la possiamo giocare

4815496 bases its claims on breaches of their organisational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery
4815497 who did you speak to or write to or otherwise communicate with in the community ands on what date and with what result and with what evidence
4815498 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
4815499 all indonesian students are required to study religion at school and a young barry soetoro being a muslim would have been required to study islam daily in school he would have been taught to read and write arabic to recite his prayers properly to read and recite from the quran and to study the laws of islam
4815500 at that time i was not barrys teacher but he is still in my memory
4815501 i remember that he studied mengaji recitation of the quran
4815502 this is the hymn we should be singing today to mark the passing of communion
4815503 for my part if the faith and practice of the church are properly maintained the church of england can start calling itself the three seed in the spirit
4815504 the son of man came to seek and save the lost
4815505 in some cases desirable goals wealth happiness liberty in matthews example can be pursued best by abandoning belief rationality
4815506 the russians are calling it peace enforcement operation its the kind of newspeak that would make george orwell proud
4815507 this is the hymn we should be singing today to mark the passing of communion
4815508 for my part if the faith and practice of the church are properly maintained the church of england can start calling itself the three seed in the spirit
4815509 a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones
4815510 its like every letter and every number has its own color associated with it not like i chose for the letter l to be light green it just is i realized it one day when talking with my dad about how this letter was of course deep red and this number was some other color and thats when we recognized that i had this condition that he also had
4815511 the class is free however if you are unhappy at the end i will give you double your money back as we want you to be happy with your experience
4815512 however if a student arrives more than 10 minutes late i charge the late comer 200 if you help me take the money from the student i will split the money with you i split the money with you so you wont narc on me to my boss also the guarantee doesnt apply to students late to class
4815513 but you said you would charge students who arrive late 200
4815514 another thing about me i should let you know is that i lie a lot

4815516 what happens if you make a mistake when you dial a long distance number
4815517 if i answer your questions now the other people in the class will be unhappy if i dont write the questions on the white board i will forget to answer them and you will be unhappy if you remind me at the end of the class i will answer your questions in more detail and people who are not interested can leave and ones who are interested can stay and listen
4815518 i was a computer consultant i was very expert with computers but i had an accident
4815519 the main effect of the brain injury is that i damaged my short term memory i understand information when people explain it to me but then a few minutes later i forget the information again
4815520 what do the doctors say about your condition as they optimistic that your condition will improve
4815521 i also suffer from severe diabetes my doctors tell me that the medications that might help me with my mental condition will interact with my diabetic condition and probably kill me
4815522 i tell all my students that the main thing they need to do to learn the things i tell them is practice over and over again this is known as drill it is a boring but necessary part of learning for example if you are learning a musical instrument you usually have to practice scales
4815523 this is true for me as well i dont learn anything unless i practice a lot it may be that this will help you as well if you drill a lot you may have to practice ten times as much as the average person but the basic idea is the same
4815524 i am not an expert on brain functioning but my understanding is that the brain benefits from exercise just as the other parts of our bodies do

4815530 mientras la agroindustria especuladora esta obligando a la poblaci n a comer arroz premium a cinco bs f
4815531 hey give us some support here we are we are out here every single day doing this
4815532 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4815533 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4815534 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4815535 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4815536 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4815537 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4815538 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4815539 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4815540 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4815541 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4815542 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4815543 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4815544 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4815545 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4815546 si ellos juegan con la intensidad y el acierto de este s bado es muy dif cil que lo pueda hacer cualquiera ganarles pero es posible que no jueguen con la misma intensidad y el mismo acierto
4815547 la tradici n fue la oposici n m s tenaz mas constante mas persistente y mas demoniaca con que se encontr el maestro le atacaba por dondequiera que iba rechazando silenciosamente su ense anza
4815548 y cuando cruzaron a la otra orilla llegaron a la tierra de genesaret y amarraron la barca pero cuando ellos salieron de la barca en seguida le reconocieron recorrieron toda aquella regi n y comenzaron a traer en camillas a los que estaban enfermos a donde o an que l estaba dondequiera que entraba ya sea en aldeas o ciudades o campos pon an en las plazas a los que estaban enfermos y le rogaban que s lo pudiesen tocar el borde de su manto y todos los que le tocaban quedaban sanos
4815549 el mismo tom nuestras debilidades y carg con nuestras enfermedades
4815550 se juntaron a jes s los fariseos y algunos de los escribas que hab an venido de jerusal n ellos vieron que algunos disc pulos de l estaban comiendo pan con las manos impuras es decir sin lavar pues los fariseos y todos los jud os si no se lavan las manos hasta la mu eca no comen porque se aferran a la tradici n de los ancianos
4815551 le preguntaron los fariseos y los escribas por qu no andan tus disc pulos de acuerdo con la tradici n de los ancianos sino que comen pan con las manos impuras y les respondi diciendo bien profetiz isa as acerca de vosotros hip critas como esta escrito este pueblo me honra de labios pero su coraz n est lejos de m y en vano me rinden culto ense ando como doctrina los mandamientos de hombres
4815552 por que no andan tus disc pulos de acuerdo con la tradici n
4815553 te das cuenta de que has ofendido a esos fariseos
4815554 no queremos ir a las iglesias porque est n llenas de hip critas
4815555 us is palabras grandilocuentes palabras maravillosas palabra acerca de dios las llamaban pero no lo es de verdad habl is acerca del amor pero no am is habl is sobre el perd n pero no perdon is habl is sobre la aceptaci n pero no acept is
4815556 porque yo formo parte del pesonal del hospital y me dar a verg enza que me vieran as no me han visto nunca sangrando y sucio siempre me ven limpio y sano ahora soy todo un espect culo
4815557 pero a qui n le importa lo que pueda pensar el instructor necesita usted que le curen
4815558 pero es que adem s hay otras razones la encargada de admisiones se sentir a molesta
4815559 porque siempre se enfada si alguien que tiene que ser admitido no tiene todos los detalles que necesita para rellenar el formulario no he visto al que me ha atropellado y ni siquiera s qu marca de coche era ni su n mero de matricula ella no lo entender a es una perfeccionista cuando se trata de los datos m dicos es peor que eso no siquiera tengo mi tarjeta de la compa a de seguros blue cross
4815560 bueno si no me reconocen por el aspecto que tengo no me admitir n porque no admitir an a nadie con este aspecto sin una tarjeta de blue cross tienen que asegurarse que no tiene que pagarlo la instituci n ellos protegen a la instituci n col quenme en la acera nada mas me las arreglar de alguna manera es culpa m a que me hayan atropellado
4815561 no sentir a deseo alguno de ir a la iglesia a la ma ana siguiente para que me viese todo el mundo
4815562 me har an el vac o y me mirar an como si fuese un extra o y no perteneciese all para nada algunos de los mas santurrones me acusar an de ser un hip crita la maestra de la escuela dominical se enfadar a conmigo por no haberme aprendido la lecci n que se hab a ense ado los que se sentasen junto a mi se sentir an avergonzados y no sabr an c mo reaccionar porque no sabr an lo que sentir an los dem s y no sabr an realmente c mo reaccionar ante un santo conocido que se hubiese contaminado
4815563 no es el fin del mundo a mi me ha pasado y lo he superado
4815564 veo que has fallado y te han descubierto no dejes que eso te deprima conozco a un buen abogado que te ayudar
4815565 pues ahora te pareces mas a nosotros de lo que parec as antes y ahora sabemos que eres igual que nosotros
4815566 llevadme a la iglesia all est n mis hermanos y ellos me quieren all podr restablecerme soy un miembro d bil del cuerpo pero cuando estoy afligido los miembros fuertes se ponen de mi parte y no necesito tener al d a los pagos de mi tarjeta de blue cross y s que cuando esto haya quedado atras no hablar n sobre el tema
4815567 en vano me rinden culto ense ando como doctrina los mandamientos de hombres
4815568 qu es la adoraci n esa es una buena pregunta qu es la adoraci n
4815569 dios es esp ritu y es necesario que los que le adoran le adoren en esp ritu y en verdad
4815570 porque dejando los mandamientos de dios os aferr is a la tradici n de los hombres
4815571 vaya manera que ten is de rechazar el mandamiento de dios con tal de guardar la tradici n
4815572 honra a tu padre y a tu madre y el que maldiga a su padre o su madre muera irremisiblemente pero vosotros dec s que cualquiera que diga a su padre o su madre aquello con lo que hubieras sido beneficiado es mi ofrenda a dios no debe honrar a su padre as hab is invalidado la palabra de dios por causa de vuestra tradici n y muchas otras cosas hac is
4815573 no se lo que est pasando todo me est saliendo mal en la vida estoy a punto de perder mi negocio porque se nos est hundiendo toda nuestra base financiera y no entiendo por qu est pasando porque durante a os le he dado dinero a dios le he entregado fielmente grandes sumas de dinero es algo que siempre he puesto primero pero a pesar de ello todo se est viniendo abajo
4815574 se ha parado usted a pensar alguna vez que lo que dios quiere no es su dinero sino a usted
4815575 dios te importa que en lugar de mi te entrege mi dinero mi tiempo mi esposa mis hijos o mis intereses pero a mi no me toques
4815576 ten is una manera muy h bil de rechazar el mandamiento de dios
4815577 no pueden tocar ese dinero lo lamento lo tengo todo de modo que puedo desgravar impuestos y por eso no pueden ped rmelo
4815578 llamando as otra vez a toda la multitud les dec a o dme todos y entended
4815579 si es usted culpable de una sola de ellas entonces es usted capaz de todas ellas
4815580 recuerdo a una de las mujeres mas santas que he conocido que me sorprendi dici ndome
4815581 no est s convencido de que hablo en serio pero me doy cuenta de que si hay una persona que ha cometido un solo pecado que me considero incapaz de cometer entonces no puedo amar a esa persona el mismo pecado que se manifiesta en la vida de esas persona en su forma tambi n se da en mi y se manifiesta de otras maneras hasta que llega el momento en que estoy convencida de que tambi n yo soy una santurrona orgullosa y arrogante
4815582 y levant ndose parti de all para los territorios de tiro y sidon y entr en una casa y no quer a que nadie lo supiese pero no pudo esconderse mas bien en seguida oy de l una mujer cuya hija ten a un esp ritu inmundo y vino y cay a sus pies la mujer era griega de nacionalidad sirofenicia y le rogaba que echase el demonio fuera de su hija pero jes s le dijo deja primero que se sacien los hijos porque no es bueno tomar el pan de los hijos y echarlo a los perritos ella respondi y le dijo si se or tambi n los perritos debajo de la mesa comen de las migajas de los hijos entonces l dijo por causa de lo que has dicho v el demonio ha salido de tu hija y cuando ella se fue a su casa hall a su hija acostada en la cama y que el demonio hab a salido
4815583 por qu fue jes s a tiro y a sid n
4815584 se or hijo de david ten misericordia de mi mi hija es gravemente atormentada por un demonio
4815585 tendr s que esperar hasta que llegue el momento hasta que el evangelio sea predicado a los gentiles y entonces podr sanar a tu hija al acudir a mi bajo esta base has impuesto unos l mites y barreras a dios y hasta que no sean eliminadas no podr s acudir a mi
4815586 s se or ya s que eso es lo correcto es preciso que los hijos se alimentan primero y que luego se alimenten los perritos pero hasta los peorritos se alimentan de las migajas que caen de la mesa de los hijos
4815587 porque este pueblo se acerca con su boca y me honra solo con sus labios pero su coraz n est lejos de mi
4815588 cant you just have one happy comment youre breathing so knock off the pity party
4815589 no matter what happens it will all turn out for the best
4815590 when vanity is not prompting us we have little to say
4815591 i find his realism refreshing and a good counter to my optimism
4815592 i often wonder at what price would i sell the things i value most about myself for mr mangan it seems a share dividend is enough
4815593 dennis mangan defends himself against the charge that hes fonder of ducks than of his fellow humans
4815594 un blog inteligente punzante culto y a veces pol ticamente muy incorrecto
4815595 dennis is one of those versatile intelligences you suspect from the books that they exist but never meet in real life
4815596 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4815597 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4815598 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4815599 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4815600 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4815601 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4815602 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4815603 i hope that these measures will prevent the terrorists from carrying attacks and bombings in the holy city

4815625 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4815626 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4815627 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4815628 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4815629 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement djokovic said
4815630 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4815631 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4815632 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4815633 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4815634 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4815635 my view is that im there to make sure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against a particular candidate
4815636 i do it because by law im required to do it its not something i chose to do
4815637 i have been able to arrive at a level where im comfortable on this
4815638 doping by the pool invalidates phelps beijing 2008 olympic swimming gold world records
4815639 music can have influences on the breathing rate e g via emotional effects such an increased arousal which will alter oxygen levels in the blood or relaxing effects so that fewer muscles consume oxygen which also increases oxygen levels
4815640 has reported clear changes in breathing rate on a conference last year with breathing rate being higher during pleasant music
4815641 duration of the effect is not certain from seconds to minutes
4815642 m usic next to the swimming pool less than 2 minutes before the start could indicate performance enhancement because of transient increase of blood oxygen capacity
4815643 a bio chemical feedback mechanism from an external source the external source in the present case music is available to everyone not harmful to the athlete or his peers and carried out under full disclosure hence i do not see how this conflicts with fair play and honesty
4815644 i am not an expert on the world anti doping agency wada

4815659 ok but two years is quite a bit of time
4815660 if id said yes she was ready to sign up for the meal plan
4815661 oh you have nice smooth tall legs im short so wtf and you have really nice eyes
4815662 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4815663 im going to rely on my experience pretty heavily i think its one of my assets that i can bring to the table hopefully they can make it work for me on the field
4815664 personally i dont really care about me doing well i know that if im the starting quarterback me doing well means my team is doing well
4815665 i care a lot about the university and i care a lot about this football program since i was a little kid
4815666 i think its a big advantage i had not many quarterbacks in high school are under center anymore more of a spread offense in high school i was pro style and under center all the time the transition i wouldnt say has been easy but i think its been easier for me than it would be a lot of high school quarterbacks
4815667 its exciting its a dream of mine its not a dream come true yet but its one step closer to be up there im not there yet by any means but to be close its definitely something special
4815668 youve got to be ready to play in any circumstances
4815669 my body is probably not big enough yet but its all about mental toughness i think i can take the hits
4815670 i feel good about my chances ive been working hard everyday thats the main thing everybody on the team has been working hard the rest of the quarterbacks as well
4815671 coach knows what hes doing whatever the decision is were going to be ready for it and move on
4815672 god made me this way for reason i may not be the tallest quarterback in the world but god made me this way for a reason
4815673 i feel like ive got certain talents and i use them to the best of my abilities
4815674 i think the key to apply pressure is knowing how to blitz timing of it its not so much if youre a ten star athlete or something like that it doesnt take a superstar to create pressure
4815675 this year since the start of camp weve made so much improvement
4815676 any quarterback throwing to you the ball is in the air and youve got to go get it theres competition between the quarterbacks competition between the wide receivers and competition between the line
4815677 i was very immature now that im back in the situation i am i feel like ive matured a lot more i just feel so much better being back in this situation
4815678 we had a meeting yesterday with the wide receivers and were coming together were figuring out what weve got to do to get this offense up and running
4815679 weve just got to take it one game at a time
4815680 were catching on to what his goals are what he wants us to achieve and how to run his program
4815681 its definitely tough because you think youre about to have this great season i definitely understand what donald bowens is going through
4815682 its a part of football its a part of the game
4815683 they are great talents curt underwood got a lot of experience last year he stepped in and i can already tell that hes a better player than he was last year thats scary for defenses brandon barnes hes a top prospect coming in and he showed it throughout camp hes going to be a great player for us
4815684 outrageously insinuates that ms gershon has had an inappropriate sexual relationship with president clinton this is absolutely false
4815685 gershon has only been in the same room as president clinton on three occasions
4815686 we also dont want the church subjected to the scrutiny that a presidential campaign legitimately undergoes
4815687 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

4815692 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4815693 we will be gone at the end of the year
4815694 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4815695 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4815696 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4815697 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4815698 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4815699 we need to be able to be there for people who need us
4815700 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4815701 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4815702 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4815703 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4815704 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4815705 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4815706 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4815707 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4815708 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4815709 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4815710 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4815711 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top
4815712 what other city in the world has pernicious wildlife running around in its city parks

4815724 s storyline but lead designer jay wilson did tell me that the game will round out the story arc set up by the previous two games
4815725 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
4815726 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
4815727 mit der teilnahme hier in peking habe ich mir einen traum erf llt

4815742 we continue to have record months of fundraising this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before
4815743 mccain now has enough financial resources to break tradition and advertise during the oppositions convention week
4815744 the mccain camp is building a case about obamas ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters
4815745 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation
4815746 no doubt the obama campaign will do the same now
4815747 we have reached agreement with fulham and we still have one or two things to settle with the player and his representatives but we are hopeful that one will go through
4815748 that should happen in the next couple of days its a transfer that has been really ongoing so we dont want to count our chickens
4815749 but we have agreed with the club now which is a big thing and we would hope we can reach agreement with stevens people over the next couple of days
4815750 with maurice edu we have to wait on a work permit for that one and hopefully we can be successful there
4815751 hes a defensive midfield player he was recommended to us and we had a good look at him towards the end of last season but the mls were not prepared to sell him at that time they are now and we managed to get in there
4815752 it hurt a lot i thought we could do better
4815753 what bothered me a bit was there was not that fight that i thought there would be the guys made a lot of mistakes but i dont expect them at this level to go back into their shells
4815754 then again the all blacks controlled most of the game they had a brilliant kicking game again through daniel carter
4815755 i think we were let down again by poor decisions
4815756 we took the wrong chances at the wrong times but credit to the all blacks who put us under tremendous pressure and forced us to take those kind of chances
4815757 i thought we would fight back but it never came
4815758 there are a few things we need to work on you always need to do some soul searching when you play like this

4815779 by an article in nyt about google becoming a media company
4815780 the tool is by no means perfect more of a proof of concept than a final product
4815781 dont be afraid to make mistakes and be proud of your mistakes at the end of the day learning and getting experience and getting advice from others shouldnt be seen as a weakness it should be seen as a positive
4815782 ads are created and managed under the exact same guidelines principles practices and algorithms as the ads of any other advertiser

4815784 for the term secured loans in the uk will see the merchant search ad unit
4815785 small test running against a very specific search term no other search terms will bring up the ad unit we will study the results of the test and make a decision what to do then
4815786 approached a number of advertisers lenders to see if they would be willing to take part in the test
4815787 engineers have pinpointed the issue causing the 502 errors and it looks as if users should start to regain normal functioning of their account
4815788 a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly
4815789 weve identified the source of this issue and fixed it in addition as with all issues that affect gmail and our other services were conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly
4815790 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4815791 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the musharraf impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
4815792 saudi arabia is a very strong ally of both pakistan and the us and the visit was a sincere and friendly effort to interact with all and sundry to settle the issue
4815793 the saudis have very strong bonds of friendship with us president pervez musharraf has also been very close to riyadh during his rule
4815794 president pervez musharraf has to take a decision about resignation by today or tomorrow as there is no room for any delay
4815795 if he fails to decide on tendering his resignation by today or tomorrow the process of impeachment will commence
4815796 if the president resigns the coalition government will look into the amnesty subject
4815797 i think we came out on offense and executed well
4815798 the offensive line did a nice job blocking and michael smith and dennis johnson had some big runs
4815799 what i like is that he came back later called the exact same play and threw a touchdown
4815800 we still need to work on pass rushing and getting people to the football
4815801 i thought we were a little better defending the run today
4815802 we still have to get all 11 guys on the same page
4815803 because of injuries and how young we are the defense will be a little behind the offense for now
4815804 jerry is doing a nice job and has improved a lot since the spring
4815805 hes gotten better at defending the pass which is where hes really improved
4815806 we have been supplying the best asian supermodels for the past 15 years to brisbane gold coast sydney and now internationally we hold national and international model searches all over asia and australia to collect the very best there is to offer they are then tutored in all areas conversation presentation and the sexual arts for that unforgettable encounter
4815807 i need some kind of simple bias pattern for that
4815808 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4815809 we tried to stick together as a group i tried to lead the team out but it was nearly impossible
4815810 the thing that saved us was we were prepared and we had the right equipment there was an enormous amount of snow it was burying and suffocating us
4815811 i jumped in the chopper and i could feel the tears starting and when we hit the ground thats when the tears really started to flow
4815812 at every point where there was danger like when we were climbing through loose snow and trying to make it to the hut my limits were tested
4815813 when you start going down to your neck in snow you know that you cant go any further
4815814 when we knew we couldnt get through to the hut and had to activate the beacon i knew that we were in trouble
4815815 they decided to hunker down and keep each other warm they did the right thing
4815816 i wish the school year would go by as fast as the summer does
4815817 i just thought right now id like to find out if i like coaching instead of putting in four years at a university to get my accounting degree and then thinking maybe i do want to try coaching
4815818 ive put in a lot more than four years in hockey
4815819 ive got 25 27 years of experience might as well give that a shot first

4815912 hes a guy that can pinch run for us late hes a guy that can spell an infielder
4815913 he can play first he can play anywhere thats the thing that he can do hes similar to wilson betemit in the sense that he can play any infield position and has more speed than wilson well use him as we need him
4815914 i feel like i can play everywhere in the infield
4815915 i dont feel like im going to hurt anybody defensively i try to make all the plays and hopefully get some hits here and there
4815916 i really wasnt thinking about when it was going to happen i was definitely hoping that it would but i couldnt say that i thought it was going to
4815917 its not going to do you any good to go like this though

4815922 i was there with her although i cant honestly say i was of much help i felt someone hit me from behind the next thing i remember is waking up in a dark room with angelus facing me a twisted smile on his face
4815923 he kept saying something but i wasnt coherent enough to make it out his methods of torture are rather barbaric and i imagine extremely effective im not sure how i got there i imagine i was knocked unconscious again or perhaps had lost too much blood but the next thing i remember is you finding me in the street
4815924 look after buffy she shouldnt patrol tonight shes much too easy a target in this state when shes feeling better take her home call the others make sure theyre safe then get some rest right now im much more worried about buffy theres no saying what effect all this business with angelus is having on her

4815948 the constitutional role of the army is what it is a nonpolitical one
4815949 and the position of the army in all this has emerged with perfect clarity they are saying we are hands off
4815950 they havent come this far in order to turn back
4815951 that would cast a cloud over the entire institution the army itself would be seen as being in the dock

4815957 at the michael j fox foundation we believe that our capital has an obligation to fund high risk high reward projects that if successful could significantly improve the lives of people with parkinsons
4815958 a major element of our work is the identification and prioritization of approaches like armagen s efforts that without our backing would likely stall for lack of resources
4815959 trojan horse technology has intrigued parkinsons researchers for years because of its theoretical potential to overcome the drug delivery hurdle one of the single most significant challenges facing the entire field
4815960 it is fitting that the michael j fox foundation which is searching urgently for treatments that will significantly modify parkinsons disease should provide funding to vet the potential of this technology to yield new therapies that could transform patients lives
4815961 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4815962 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000 kilometres

4815965 there are a lot of folks who want to get a divorce and the house is an impediment because nobody wants it
4815966 one of the ways they pay their legal fees is by selling or refinancing their home and selling the home is getting more difficult
4815967 its in inventory with homes that are just like it
4815968 a lot of times both of them cannot agree on what to do
4815969 it can be a huge financial mess in the past a lot of times folks wanted to keep the house and lately thats not the case
4815970 every time your lawyer goes to court youre paying for the lawyers time and some of these people dont have the money
4815971 i think were seeing people who are not divorcing some people cannot leave comfortably at this time
4815972 what were having is two people staying in the house because they cant afford two places theyre staying together in the same place with a fair amount of difficulty including threats of domestic violence and incidents
4815973 right now is a very ugly time in my business
4815974 nobody wants that on their side of the ledger they might want the house but they dont want it at the value thats being agreed to or because they dont feel its a safe investment
4815975 in some cases neither wants any of it its a past life
4815976 the concerns about inflationary pressures leading to future interest rate increases may be causing borrowers to choose the safety and certainty of fixed rates
4815977 thats a strong reason that lenders arent going to be real interested in doing five year arms or even three year arms because you have to qualify based on seven years out
4815978 the other reason is in the media this story just keeps getting worse and worse about how the mortgage industry thought we hit bottom but weve actually gone through the bottom of the barrel and were in the ground now the bleeding hasnt stopped yet so every consumer who needs to do something is scared to death of anything but a fixed rate mortgage
4815979 the first thing that pops into your head is that its bigfoot
4815980 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect

4815990 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4816003 women here still feel threatened one cant yet see a pervasive shift in the way women dress they continue to wear the conservative clothing that the militias began compelling them to wear after the u s invasion most women remain cocooned in shapeless black abaya dresses and hijab scarves that covered their hair before the war tammy says she could walk down the streets of her hometown the southern and heavily shia iraqi port city of basra dressed like most teenagers in the united states in jeans and no head scarf saddam husseins regime was one of the worlds most despotic but it was secular and allowed iraqi women personal rights and freedoms unparalleled in the persian gulf women who make up more than half of the countrys populartion could drive travel abroad alone serve in iraqi security forces and work side by side with men they chose whom to marry and whether to marry at all and were among the most educated in the region after the u s invasion in 2003 conservative muslim clerics called for iraq to become an islamic state in the name of islamic values they eroded the liberties women here enjoyed even under saddams oppressive regime schools once coed became segregated by gender women were afraid to go outside without a head scarf as sectarian violence engulfed baghdad and other parts of the country in 2006 it brought in its wake even more constraints on womens freedoms
4816004 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape

4816054 people will tick yes just to get rid of the issue or because they are intimidated by the approach
4816055 the difference with my proposed alternative charter for change is that it will only take four weeks to complete not 11 months and it will not require any overseas consultants to be engaged it will involve only a handful of volunteers and will not cost the taxpayers of fiji a single cent
4816056 an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of individualistic concern to the broader concerns of all humanity

4816058 the symptoms are there they sleep in school and their exam results are very poor
4816059 they are mostly boys and they often have odd behaviour
4816060 the worst part is that it drifts right to the primary school students
4816061 its their livelihood so the children will see it from there
4816062 and since they are young they will want to experiment to know whats it like smoking marijuana
4816063 we were not invited and dont expect to be invited
4816064 i sat next to reverend waqairatu and we spent our time listening to the choirs

4816068 the big shops are still supplying the items that we dont have but i am not sure of the post shop because they did not receive any supply the last time the boat came
4816069 the franchise scheme which subsidises shipping companies so that shipping companies could make some profit
4816070 under the scheme kadavu shipping and ba shipping service the island
4816071 ba shipping owns cagi mai ba which is undergoing repairs this is the fourth month that the boat has been out of service it last went in may
4816072 the last ship to rotuma was last month telecom chartered the westerland and we managed to send some fuel and shops

4816074 we have one of the highest suicide rates in the world among our women
4816075 the fiji labour party controls the sugar cane growers council the interim government and mr chaudhry are presiding over the demise of the industry
4816076 many of them have already left the industry because of those reasons and even more of them are thinking of leaving because of the difficulties they are facing at the moment
4816077 more and more indian people will move out of the industry

4816114 only the hype created by the media might lead to some members of the council raising the issue during out meeting on sunday
4816115 i like fiji to come and have not received any reservation
4816116 sometimes the media tends to just report on controversial issues rather than relevant issues of importance to the region
4816117 please focus on all the good things especially what this meeting means for niue
4816118 without this information rumours coconut wireless and whispers would create undue anxiety and instability within our communities
4816119 we recognize individuals rights to express their opinions and the medias responsibility is to ensure dialogue transpires between different parties
4816120 the disclosure of information must be handled with care and responsibility and not undermine public interest and the analysis are ethical and moral
4816121 increasingly the hibiscus festival has a major and indispensable role as a contributor to charity for which we are ever so grateful
4816122 while this role is recognised and widely appreciated it is the fervent hope of the residents and people of this city that the hibiscus festival will not turn away from its roots
4816123 as it contributes to a feeling of belonging to one big happy national family
4816124 this festival is a pathway to launch a new spirit of reconciliation where bridges of understanding can be built to bring all communities together for a common purpose under the theme spirit of harmony
4816125 this is a national survey that will be carried out towards the end of the year
4816126 we do routine coverage and after two to three years we do a survey
4816127 a survey basically attempts to validate the routine statistics that we collect every year so now this survey is for 2008 and that is something that is planned for immunisation and our child health
4816128 the pope has a cat he loves a lot so why doesnt he use it for one of his capes
4816129 os empregados de uma loja em berlim na alemanha encontraram um jeito inusitado para conscientizar os clientes sobre a necessidade de usar menos material nas embalagens de cosm ticos e produtos de perfumaria usando apenas avental eles foram s ruas nesta quarta feira e fizeram panfletagem sobre o tema

4816131 a smart businessman knows when to get up and leave
4816132 we want business in the city but when those businesses violate the ordinances we have to take action
4816133 if theres no stripping theres no money theres no club
4816134 each time they come in customers feel uncomfortable and dont even want to be inside

4816137 i prefer going to a bank and saying hello to a bank teller
4816138 were hoping that individuals will take an interest in the health of the community and sponsor certain rooms
4816139 but at least one of the commissioners thinks theyre too low
4816140 the company is worth a certain price as determined by the market
4816141 it challenged me personally in terms of how i need to be sensitive to member churches expectations and interests in as far as what the fcc can do and should do
4816142 it has helped me in building and strengthening the working relationship of fcc with the other stakeholders that include government ministries ngos international organisations faith based organisations and most importantly the wider church organisations in the pacific region and globally
4816143 it also helped me to convince member churches of the need for impartiality on controversial issues the nation is facing
4816144 for a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin real life but there was always some obstacle in the way something to be gotten through first some unfinished business time still to be served a debt to be paid then life would begin at last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life
4816145 look i dont really know what to say other than hey our bad
4816146 seriously dude it just totally wasnt like us to lash out like that weve been having a couple of bad decades and i guess we just sort of snapped
4816147 police were working together with nightclub owners to see that underage people stay out
4816148 there is an increase in police visibility on the streets
4816149 accadono cose che sono come domande passano i girni oppure gli anni e la vita risponde
4816150 is that a weight on my conscience well yes i t
4816151 as humans we are born in the trust of loving and in being loved within an ecology of the natural world and within the larger living cosmos
4816152 we live in the braiding of emotions and languaging in our manner of living together
4816153 it limits some things you can do with your fronts but it improves some other things it improves our speed our coverage ability
4816154 kenya too has no asian or european street children a reflection of racist doctrine during the colonial period up to the early 1960s
4816155 intention of this work is to bring order into this confusion by suggesting more informed evidence based and practical recommendation for policy makers that take the childrens characteristics and perspectives more full into account
4816156 they are reluctant to abandon the street life isnt this a scientific misconception
4816157 as the right took power so did its media mouthpieces
4816158 there are steps we can take right now that will begin to slow and eventually reverse the drain of dollars to the petro vampires foreign and domestic the result would be a stronger safer and cleaner america that would once again be leading the rest of the world to a more promising future
4816159 war was from the very start a cherished project of the right
4816160 that whatever differences the democrats may have and however heated and divisive the partys primary race became when it comes to endless war the two parties are headed in wildly different directions the democrats are all looking to the future while the right remains mired in a neanderthal past
4816161 with the fall of the berlin wall the right lost its lodestar
4816162 opposition to communism was the most basic of all conservative beliefs
4816163 the 2008 democratic convention needs to link the reality of the two americas with bushs miserable failures in iraq
4816164 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
4816165 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
4816166 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
4816167 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part

4816169 the last campaign robert f kennedy and 82 days that inspired america
4816170 how many women feel like theyre the hottest thing on the planet right now i feel like im motherfucking magnificent
4816171 jack s opponents are running a very misleading ad that implies that i do not support jack and that s simply not true jack harper is a solid conservative and a great republican please vote for jack harper for state senate
4816172 if the people that know the pro gay marriage pro higher taxes zerby the best his neighbors cannot support him why would anyone
4816173 hmm i wonder how much kopeks a registered dead dissident soul fetches
4816174 its a formality for me if i want to climb the ranks
4816175 being a party member gives you greater freedom of speech
4816176 an unstable society deprived of the vote unstable in part because it has no means of expression or a society in chaos because it has the vote
4816177 most of us have discarded the myth of revolution as well as a belief in democracy and elections
4816178 that is all dangerous stuff we need to find a middle way
4816179 who can say that elected leaders will be any better than the people governing china today
4816180 if an urban middle class with a capacity for legal action and a political rationale does not have the means to defend its interests efficiently or if the government systematically prevents it from doing so by using the law or political action or even by threats and violence then citizens may decide on revolutionary action that is a more costly option in terms of social subversion and political risk
4816181 society is the only force that can modernize the country and expand the scope for liberty and social justice
4816182 everyone in the village is very angry they feel the crew are being punished for trying to save a life
4816183 the boat at hope cove is vital because it takes 25 minutes for the lifeboat to get from salcombe and a swimmer could easily drown when the mca withdrew the boat in june they said it would be for six weeks but the crew wanted it back as soon as possible so they paid for the repairs themselves
4816184 they were then told it had to stay off service until it was surveyed and that would have taken it out for the whole of the summer season anyone would have done the same thing when they saw the girl in trouble
4816185 the health and safety of the boat crews and those who they may render assistance to is of paramount importance
4816186 search and rescue effectiveness will not be compromised by the suspension of the general purpose boat these general purpose boats are additional facilities and are not generally used as part of the first response to an incident
4816187 we have identified serious breaches of health and safety procedures and they are currently being investigated the boat has been stood down for a further eight weeks while we investigate the possibility of repair or replacement
4816188 i can tell you as a police professional with some experience of firearms incidents that it is the health and safety zealots who are responsible

4816191 im happy to have my chance and im trying to do everything i possibly can to make myself stick
4816192 im blessed i took one of the hardest roads you can possibly take now that im here its a blessing
4816193 basically i had the kind of 40 yard dash time for a guy my size that made some scouts take a look
4816194 some of them asked me hey where have you been
4816195 young stupid mistakes immature mistakes i knew better i decided to do my own thing and i suffered the consequences
4816196 but then i started my road back one of the things i did is i tried to get back in touch with my faith and the other thing was understanding its not just me im not doing anything just for me anymore i have kids im doing this for my family
4816197 im a rookie and a free agent rookie nobody owes me anything and especially with my track record i expect to be tested and watched very closely
4816198 hes done a good job working with defensive line coach randy melvin ive seen the progress with his technique hes becoming more consistent with what hes doing
4816199 hes tough and he has some ability anytime you see a young guy come in take coaching and improve those are good signs
4816200 my approach with all the players is to treat them all with respect and set the bar high
4816201 i have expectations for how they work and compete every day and how they conduct themselves whatever a guy brings to the table in his past in my mind thats exactly where it is the past
4816202 i dont think you feel like you belong i think you have to know
4816203 tengo unos guantes de portero te los vendo por 500 euros
4816204 vamos a jugar un rato con tu bal n y guantes de portero
4816205 we have reached agreement with fulham and we still have one or two things to settle with the player and his representatives but we are hopeful that one will go through
4816206 that should happen in the next couple of days its a transfer that has been really ongoing so we dont want to count our chickens
4816207 but we have agreed with the club now which is a big thing and we would hope we can reach agreement with stevens people over the next couple of days
4816208 with maurice edu we have to wait on a work permit for that one and hopefully we can be successful there
4816209 hes a defensive midfield player he was recommended to us and we had a good look at him towards the end of last season but the mls were not prepared to sell him at that time they are now and we managed to get in there
4816210 it hurt a lot i thought we could do better
4816211 what bothered me a bit was there was not that fight that i thought there would be the guys made a lot of mistakes but i dont expect them at this level to go back into their shells
4816212 then again the all blacks controlled most of the game they had a brilliant kicking game again through daniel carter
4816213 i think we were let down again by poor decisions
4816214 we took the wrong chances at the wrong times but credit to the all blacks who put us under tremendous pressure and forced us to take those kind of chances
4816215 i thought we would fight back but it never came
4816216 there are a few things we need to work on you always need to do some soul searching when you play like this
4816217 we didnt see any body language of superiority today to show that we are a proud rugby nation
4816218 kangana interpreta a una bailarina de salsa en kites y buscaba a un entrenador profesional anurag ayud su a b squeda y contrat los servicios de kaytee que tiene equipos profesionales por todo el mundo

4816222 but for a bag of sugar i wouldnt be alive
4816223 the war had already started and against the wishes of my father i was born mother loved me almost to death literally she actually risked her own life by smuggling a bag of sugar inside her vagina into the camp she was caught and almost killed all that for me to keep me alive
4816224 i thought the film was so tame that you could either take your grandmother to it or your granddaughter the call girls were made to look too trashy and whorish and not at all elegant like they used to be
4816225 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4816226 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments

4816230 hi im cheryl living in bla bla bla and im doing so and so
4816231 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
4816232 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
4816233 it was way out of reason the suspect in this case thought his information was worth a whole lot more it was more than you could by a steak with
4816234 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4816235 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4816236 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4816237 nu vreau s mai suferim trebuie s d m gol repede arge ului
4816238 what is the price of greatness in your world or worse than that are you willing to live without greatness will you acquess to mediocrity no one will know whether you have been here or not the worse thing in the world to accept defeat and be consumed by the wave of negativity that rules this world you dont need to live in the dark side what is the price of greatness in your world
4816239 ian im in school ive got to put in an extra year and i hate to miss that year because you know ill get into practice and ill be thirty five and ill have missed a couple of years
4816240 ian how do you see four hundred people a day
4816241 one at a time you start early and you finish late when you leave the office you leave three tracks your heels and your ass because you are physically bushed youre beat youre tired
4816242 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
4816243 no man ever entered the earth more honorably than those who died in spain
4816244 there were no rewards in spain they were fighting for us all against the combined forces of european fascism they deserved our thanks and respect and20they got neither
4816245 i realized that you can keep your own ideals though its not an easy thing to do at all the point of the book is to show that none of them left the struggle
4816246 our monument is to remember a group of people who stood up to take a stand
4816247 the stuff were made of never goes away with or without a monument because the bastards will never cease their evil and the decent human beings will never stop their struggle
4816248 you can go with pride you are history you are legend you are the heroic example of the solidarity and the universality of democracy we will not forget you and when the olive tree of peace puts forth its leaves entwined in the with the laurels of the spanish republics victory come back
4816249 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
4816250 we believe our actions served the best interest of justice
4816251 well everyone understands the meaning of justice and thats all were going to say
4816252 it sure looks like these groups simply wanted to avoid the politically explosive issue of cove mallard
4816253 the betrayal of the wilderness society on this point is devastating
4816254 if the country need lumber and timber jobs the cove mallard isnt such a bad place to get it
4816255 the northern rockies chapter of the sierra club which covers all of idaho and some of eastern washington never opposed timber sales in the cove mallard because the area is mostly flat
4816256 basically the intent of the task force was to expedite timber sales in idaho roadless areas by circumventing nepa
4816257 gehrke and baird were there to put a green stamp on illegal timber sales
4816258 we trust the forest service to abide by the law
4816259 did this voluntarily we didnt want to come between working people and their jobs
4816260 sometimes youve got to come promise in the face of political reality
4816261 maybe the lawsuit was ill timed considering the new political atmosphere
4816262 but it was a good suit a necessary action giving up the injunction so quickly sent the worst possible political and legal message
4816263 salmon arent endangered there are cans of them on the shelf at albertsons
4816264 i dont want to pick a fight with these guys
4816265 not only did gehrke help nullify an effective injunction that had stopped the cove mallard sale for at least a few more months
4816266 but he offended a friendly judge forced roselle and fullum to sacrifice themselves and show the opposition just how weak the national environmental groups really are
4816267 essentially what we need the government to do is get out of the way let the market system work get some certainly into the west side timber supply because we dont know whether to build another plant here to go to canada or even whether we should be hiring folks for a month from now because we cant be assured that our veneer supplier are going to have the raw material were going to need
4816268 the wilderness societys founders aldo leopold and bob marshall believed that progress in environmental protection required radical political and economic changes
4816269 but the new wilderness society through its repeated actions has refused to challenge a system where our public resources are controlled by renegade public agencies and multinational corporations a system that assumes that our natural resources exist solely for the purpose of making money the wilderness societys corporate motto is whatever you do dont offend anyone
4816270 estou a ganhar dinheiro porque o povo portugu s est a pagar para eu estar aqui e n o consegui chegar final
4816271 why did intelligence civil affairs psyop and special forces allow their turf to be trampled on by tradoc dcsint why allow so much money to be wasted when those elements could have used it better
4816272 since shes been with the hts program she has been a dedicated and committed professional
4816273 as pointed out from the start the weak points were and remain training and recruitment for anthropologists and military team members there is a heavy price tag of 110 000 and upwards of 200 000 for htt leaders per deployment but lots of academias best will not be swayed by dollars where are the assets for recruitment
4816274 as usual the fobbits forward operating base personnel who never leave the base and remfs rear echelon mother f are in charge and the guys on the line are ignored who needs a combat veteran when youve got google looks like we got out at the right time
4816275 i think we do need an hts program albeit better managed
4816276 all in all it was quite enjoyable for me to observe iraqis and soldiers enjoying each others company unfortunately the hts program managers never asked me to brief them on any successes i had while deployed it may not have been on the grand scale of building a soccer field in a remote village but it was an important step to building trusting relationships
4816277 are studying politics which has some cultural elements but not culture in the restricted sense most of the htt reports are boilerplate personnel recruiting vetting etc
4816278 there is something wrong here this was a super concept but the hts program management did not have the people to execute or support the hts concept no one is in charge at the higher levels and there is no way to get rid of anyone they were told early on that someone would die because they anthropologists social scientists are not qualified for military operations and do not understand where they fit in with the military or recognize just how dangerous the environment they are in is they are allowed to go their own way
4816279 why wasnt she calling the lead anthropologist dr mcfate or a field advisor who is managing or advising the htts once they are deployed into combat
4816280 they htts become the responsibility of the military unit to which they are assigned
4816281 you cant attack all the people in the program some making a living some trying hard but to say that attacking the armys tradoc hts program is un american is wrong its leadership that has caused all these problems if anything questioning a program gone wrong is pro american and pro army many want to see things done right its a leadership problem much attention has been paid in the media to questioning team members qualifications yet no one has questioned the qualifications of the program leaders
4816282 if you dont have gas you cant get to work
4816283 and if you cant get to work you dont get paid and if you dont get paid you cant buy food were at their mercy
4816284 i dont know if its the gas prices and i dont know if its the grocery prices but its been through the summer
4816285 we cover 17 000 square miles in south central idaho its a lot of ground to cover
4816286 without that i wouldnt have been able to afford to go to school
4816287 it doesnt matter what the economists say all the people i chat with at the grocery store the gas station shopping for school clothes all are feeling very depressed because of the beating their budgets are taking
4816288 the marketplace works people can figure out if they should drive more or less its a little presumptuous on my part to dictate how consumers live their own lives
4816289 t he issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
4816290 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions

4816298 a long list of summer festivals moderate seasonal temperatures and upcoming events such as the governors cup weekend at the milwaukee mile arab world fest and the harley davidson 105th anniversary celebration made milwaukee the g spot as in a go to spot for those of you with your sex crazed minds in the gutter
4816299 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4816300 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4816301 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4816302 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4816303 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4816304 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4816305 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4816306 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4816307 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4816308 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4816309 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4816310 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4816311 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4816312 if we got to do this again i would win it
4816313 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4816314 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4816315 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4816316 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4816317 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4816318 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4816319 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4816320 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
4816321 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
4816322 i work with concrete and simple forms cut out in adhesive with a scalpel that became my trademark
4816323 if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so whether we live or die we belong to the lord
4816324 witch features would you like in the new version of this game

4816327 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
4816328 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
4816329 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
4816330 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
4816331 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
4816332 i would have stayed up all night long to finish reading this book i just cant get enough of portia da costa
4816333 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society
4816334 witty engaging narrative strong characters and description so vivid the scenes rise three dimensionally from the page
4816335 educar no es infundir ciencia en el alma que no la tiene sino ense ar a sta a mirar hacia el lugar adecuado

4816343 shall not subject sex workers to life long economic discrimination associated with having a criminal record
4816344 this measure is nothing more than a welcome mat for prostitutes and pimps to come and hang out in san francisco
4816345 workers would like it if crimes like rape robbery theft and coercion were vigorously investigated and prosecuted we want the right to make reports of crimes against us without being retaliated against by the police department
4816346 san franciscos law enforcement agencies shall not apply nor receive federal and state monies that institute racial profiling as a means of targeting alleged trafficked victims under the guise of enforcing the abatement of prostitution laws
4816347 would make it very challenging to investigate and prosecute human trafficking
4816348 we need to use police resources to investigate where there is a suspicion that women and children in particular immigrants are being exploited
4816349 the task force included representatives from the mayors office neighborhood groups law enforcement agencies public health agencies social service agencies various other city departments womens rights advocates and immigrant and prostitute rights groups
4816350 city departments stop enforcing and prosecuting prostitution crimes and that the departments instead focus on the quality of life infractions about which neighborhoods complain and redirect funds from prosecution public defense court time legal system overhead and incarceration towards services and alternatives for needy constituencies

4816354 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
4816355 i want to find more about what this is about
4816356 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
4816357 i told the director that it was gracious of him to apologize of course wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future

4816360 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
4816361 they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
4816362 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
4816363 i dont think theres a fixed pattern to who leads whom in this world
4816364 theres a disincentive to follow what cable is talking about
4816365 will have been talked to death by the time we get around them we need to look for whats new
4816366 i think the notion that mainstream publications orbit around cable is overstated
4816367 these findings add to the evidence of cables fixation on one big event but they also go beyond that the fact that for the most part the newspapers web sites nightly network newscasts and radio news outlets treated smiths death as a mere blip on the radar screen speaks to cables ability to magnify an event until it feels like the only story on the entire media agenda
4816368 the question it asks is what are they fighting about today today it will be mccain campaign official charlie black tomorrow it will be a misstatement by someone else
4816369 we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california
4816370 i regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and particularly for the kennedy family was in any way offensive
4816371 campaigns have gotten much better at manipulating the news cycle because cable is always there
4816372 they know cable is always dying for something to cover
4816373 the clich always is supported by the classic example the cbs evening news near syndication of the posts watergate stories in the fall of 1972
4816374 the three networks were megaphones for the best of what the elite newspapers reported that helped give the papers the elite distinction
4816375 for us in particular i dont think a newspaper story dictates our lead or significantly shapes our entire rundown more than once every couple of weeks
4816376 i dont know that anything ive done here has ever dictated how newspapers have covered a specific story but i think some of the special comments olbermanns lengthy and often angry outbursts of personal opinion put a spotlight on big picture issues some of the papers and indeed most of the political figures were not willing or able to address
4816377 i cant dismiss the idea that theres a kind of osmosis effect
4816378 at our bureau we have half a dozen political reporters with the tv on all day
4816379 there are dynamics at work in every newsroom including the most prestigious and powerful and most self satisfied that a story needs to be addressed if enough people are talking about it
4816380 i cant tell you what led anderson cooper 360 or the oreilly factor or olbermann last night
4816381 i can tell you what was on the front page of the new york times or the wall street journal or what drudge has i do check cnns web site
4816382 we may not be devoting enough energy to understanding what people are watching and engaging with and that we can add value to by covering we should at least be cognizant of it the people were trying to sell the paper to are more likely to be watching some portion of cable news than reading the new york times but in our bubble were more concerned about what our print competitors are doing than tv
4816383 i think the major newspapers the post the times the journal those three have and will continue to have a prominence in the newsroom
4816384 newspapers are having a rough time right now they dont have the immediacy of tv or the web theyve got to figure out how to capture that capture that sweet spot of relevance some newspapers are still trapped in writing about yesterday
4816385 theres much more of a deadline consciousness now at cnn than there was even five years ago
4816386 management and talent have taken notice you see more evening news talent on cable and more of what was on cable that day in the evening news they might not admit it but the center of gravity is shifting cable news is on the rise appointment news is on the wane
4816387 so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
4816388 i am so happy to go and live my religion
4816389 when i left my village i didnt think i would be here for 10 days
4816390 a land where they live like they did in the bible to the actual land of the bible
4816391 i think israel has an obligation to prove that it is not a racist state
4816392 if everyone was blond haired and had blue eyes they would bring them
4816393 there is a very strong feeling that a danger to a jewish community should never be ignored again
4816394 as far as im concerned they are jews they are as much jews as any other jew from ethiopia or new york
4816395 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4816396 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
4816397 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
4816398 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4816399 if fidel is a communist put me on the list hes got the right idea
4816400 the sign was part of the campaign by the party and by fidel to prepare the population for communism which most knew little about the idea was that since fidel had already made his name synonymous with the cuban messiah he must be right about communism
4816401 five or six days later in the wee hours of the morning they came to my house my mothers room was closest to the front door so she heard the knock and got up to see who was there when she opened the door the men pushed her out of the way and rushed into the house i awoke with a machine gun against my temple
4816402 until fidel castro dies there will be no changes in cuba fidel will not permit it the terror imposed since 1959 continues today and ra l will not dare make a single change as long as his older brother is alive
4816403 but those moments are unpredictable which is why he cannot be seen in public or on live television even for a minute
4816404 more repressive as my group the plantados refused to accept rehabilitation everyday they tried to come up with new ways to torture us
4816405 all repressive methods and tactics have failed to force a certain group of counterrevolutionary prisoners into accepting political rehabilitation
4816406 they must have thought the plan and the planners were simply crazy so they never even bothered to come for us
4816407 we felt that the world had turned its back on the prisoners of conscience in cuba
4816408 he was very nice to me at first because he didnt realize who i was
4816409 eighteen years after i was jailed there were already thousands murdered tortured boitel had already died
4816410 i told the spanish ambassador congratulations your report is very good
4816411 castro is still there because the world envies the u s and all that hatred for the u s has gone to support fidel castro
4816412 the old guard will try to maintain the status quo but there are many young officers who do not have blood on their hands and who wont want to fight for a system that has failed and is dying
4816413 the youth are losing their fear and criticizing the government openly

4816419 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4816420 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4816421 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4816422 more women are getting off the back of the bike and climbing into the seat of their own motorcycle as they see others realizing their dream of riding
4816423 this contest aims to capture the passion self confidence and beauty of female riders and inspire those who are thinking about riding to grab life by the handlebars and hit the open road deadline for entries is september 30 2008
4816424 we have a trip with friends going to camrose in september that rob still wants to do
4816425 the one piece hit our bike and the other piece hit him in the head
4816426 he fractured his kneecap fractured his face and broke his nose
4816427 the witnesses i spoke to thought he was hit by the vehicles behind him he doesnt remember anything after the board hit him
4816428 my youngest couldnt stop crying and our oldest was just as quiet as anything
4816429 i guess the only thing we can say is theyre all alive and it hasnt deterred any of them from riding again although i dont know how im going to feel getting back on the back of a bike
4816430 shes doing pretty well surprisingly she was lucky and dont forget very stupid too
4816431 as soon as the motorcycle went up she let go and let herself roll myers said

4816434 supersport motorcycles are indeed nimble and quick but they also can be deadly
4816435 these bikes made up less than 10 percent of registered motorcycles in 2005 but accounted for over 25 percent of rider deaths
4816436 supersport motorcycles have such elevated crash death rates and insurance losses because many people ride them as if they were on a racetrack
4816437 data show that speed is a big factor in their crashes
4816438 with more motorcyclists on the road and fewer of them wearing helmets the result is bound to be an increase in deaths and injuries
4816439 motorcycles are inherently risky and when crashes occur head injury is a leading cause of death the most effective way we know to reduce head injury risk is to wear helmets that meet federal safety standards wearing a helmet would have saved at least 700 motorcyclists lives in 2005 an institute analysis shows

4816448 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4816449 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4816450 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4816454 it usually starts off with a very clear plan but then rapidly becomes more complicated to use a current example i planned to introduce something called an action log into my own practice so the cycle looked like this
4816455 my background was in mainframe computer programming which developed from writing with a pencil onto coding pads through to using a monochrome uppercase video terminal when the idea of networking computers together came along it meant that all of a sudden there were sometimes real people at the other end of the typing instead of just editors compilers and test results then a bit later the internet came along and this meant that the other people could be anywhere in the world i could see that this was the beginning of a new age in human development because now anybody anywhere might have access to the sum of human knowledge this is more significant than the invention of the printing press its more like the invention of language itself

4816474 the main people we are talking about are either retirees or disabled veterans who have not filed tax returns for years because all of their income is non taxable be it from social security or veterans benefits
4816475 another is that if you havent filed in a long time it can be a very intimidating process
4816476 and also around march the irs was issuing alerts and there were press stories about scams going on involving the payments so you can imagine people being nervous about filing

4816485 the closing ceremony in beijing is still a week away but sports marketers already are scrambling to determine which athletes can squeeze the most sponsorship gold from their olympic feats the early favorites are the whale in the pool the boomers delight and a plucky gymnast
4816486 michael phelps is one of the greatest olympians ever snagging media attention normally reserved for such sports titans as tiger woods but hes not yet playing at tigers level or even that of shaquille oneal or peyton manning in the lucrative world of sports marketing getting to that level would be a true olympian feat marketing experts say because as big as phelps is now hes a star in a sport that captures our fancy only every four years within a week or so most sports fans passion will revert to its normal season cycle football and the baseball pennant race

4816500 yeah he did it look at him hang his head has he lost weight
4816501 d wade might be the most impressive player we have
4816502 you see what happens when that outside shooting is going for us
4816503 this is what hes dreaming of to play in the olympics and lead a team
4816504 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4816505 they loaded it onto the helicopters and took it straight away
4816506 its getting better and im hoping to play saturday the pain isnt as bad before it was just shooting down my legs my legs felt dead
4816507 you could tell last night that it wasnt there when you throw your fastball in the low 80s somethings just not right
4816508 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
4816509 six meat buffet the blog of choice for those of us on the atkins diet
4816510 six meat buffet is becoming a regular boner town usa god bless us everyone jihad jimmy minister of war crimes and chief defender of the faith
4816511 six meat sometimes with extra cheese and spicy peppers got brew
4816512 preston the head chef at six meat buffet wants to put his meat in your mouth
4816513 right minded thinking basted in the tasty sauce of truth
4816514 im not sure if preston is trying to put out a humorous blog or not but his writings keep me laughing
4816515 tenderized boned and free from nasty by products i love six meat buffet
4816516 one day i was looking for food on the web and i found this craphole called six meat buffet
4816517 a man and his cleaver whacking away at lipoidal thinking everywhere
4816518 smb is like pork sausage bad for you ugly to watch being made but too damned tasty to resist
4816519 what i have learned from this site is that i now know where mouth breathers and knuckle draggers come to get their rocks off
4816520 it hurt a lot i thought we could do better
4816521 what bothered me a bit was there was not that fight that i thought there would be the guys made a lot of mistakes but i dont expect them at this level to go back into their shells
4816522 then again the all blacks controlled most of the game they had a brilliant kicking game again through daniel carter
4816523 i think we were let down again by poor decisions
4816524 we took the wrong chances at the wrong times but credit to the all blacks who put us under tremendous pressure and forced us to take those kind of chances
4816525 i thought we would fight back but it never came
4816526 there are a few things we need to work on you always need to do some soul searching when you play like this
4816527 we didnt see any body language of superiority today to show that we are a proud rugby nation
4816528 el matonismo y la intimidaci n no son formas aceptables de conducir la pol tica exterior en el siglo xxi
4816529 ahora rusia necesita hacer honor a este acuerdo retirar sus fuerzas de georgia y por supuesto poner fin a sus operaciones militares
4816530 el tema principal es que la lucha de rusia por las regiones de osetia y abjasia no debe formar parte del futuro de georgia estas regiones son parte de georgia y la comunidad internacional ha repetido hasta la saciedad que seguir n si ndolo
4816531 estas resoluciones est n basadas en la premisa de que osetia del sur y abjasia permanecen dentro de las fronteras de georgia y que cualquier conflicto internacional sobre este tema se debe resolver mediante negociaciones internacionales
4816532 los suministros est n siendo repartidos entre el pueblo georgiano y en los pr ximos d as llegar n m s
4816533 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4816534 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4816535 we have reached agreement with fulham and we still have one or two things to settle with the player and his representatives but we are hopeful that one will go through
4816536 that should happen in the next couple of days its a transfer that has been really ongoing so we dont want to count our chickens
4816537 but we have agreed with the club now which is a big thing and we would hope we can reach agreement with stevens people over the next couple of days
4816538 with maurice edu we have to wait on a work permit for that one and hopefully we can be successful there
4816539 hes a defensive midfield player he was recommended to us and we had a good look at him towards the end of last season but the mls were not prepared to sell him at that time they are now and we managed to get in there
4816540 now russia needs to honor that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4816541 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4816542 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4816543 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4816544 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4816545 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4816546 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4816547 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4816548 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4816549 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4816550 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4816551 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west

4816554 we are not going to cut salaries staff or any other assets that are important to the company sometimes we compensate by raising prices but mostly were just eating the additional costs
4816555 in this economy we are in no position to ask the customer to pay more
4816556 though my company continues to grow chinas shift has made me closely monitor other expenses such as how many hours my team works and how much our office supplies cost
4816557 vinga home que porte dies aqu esperant te tot solet que ning no em fa cas
4816558 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
4816559 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
4816560 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4816561 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us

4816588 obviously we have been concentrating on the game and since friday our minds have been on the game
4816589 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it i dont have any comment to make on it
4816590 we actually opted for giovani dos santos because we thought that his speed would be something that would trouble middlesbrough
4816591 however as middlesbrough tired in the game we thought it might be the right moment in the game to throw on berbatov
4816592 seniors have earned the right to cross the bridge when they want to
4816593 i didnt care for the original proposal we use the senior tickets and they are useful

4816595 we hope the full board will give consideration to public input and not rubber stamp this like the finance committee did
4816596 i dont see efficiencies or reductions in headcounts the toll increase doesnt have to be of this magnitude
4816597 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4816598 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4816599 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament

4816601 were optimistic that the benefit of creating a foundation of 1 billion or more and the benefits that that can provide the underserved population in other words the good that that can do will be easily understood
4816602 california is a great example of a process that led to the establishment of charitable assets that are now being used productively to provide health care
4816603 the emphasis will go from patients and employers right to the shareholders
4816604 youve got to have the right products and those products have to be priced competitively
4816605 youre looking at a lumberyard have you ever seen a lumberyard catch fire thats the way this building went up
4816606 if we did id certainly think about having fire protection from day one i think a lot of people will be thinking about doing that going forward
4816607 and we were worried about the older houses on nearby elm street and hector street this building probably went up within two minutes three minutes
4816608 would have burned virtually any building the wind was blowing the heat in that direction but i will tell you and this is very reassuring to me that those buildings did exactly what they were supposed to do in a fire situation
4816609 if you watch how those buildings burned they burned from the top down
4816610 and that was the way that was designed so in effect the codes worked very very well
4816611 a good feature to ensure the fire wont go from roof to roof
4816612 my hope is that this will be a serious wake up call for better construction methods
4816613 seeing all these three to four story brick veneered wood framed residential buildings including assisted living facilities one wonders how safe they are
4816614 people who needed to get assistance from the red cross probably already got it
4816615 my main frustration is that everything changes its a very fluid situation
4816616 it really gives you a sense of what people go through
4816617 its a little overwhelming when you write a list of stuff you need when youve lost everything
4816618 in the last 200 years evolution has not been falsified by any evidence
4816619 there is no objective test that could falsify intelligent design therefore it is not a scientific theory
4816620 trust me i think id know what atheism is being that i am one
4816621 the talmud teaches that the righteousness of all the nations has a share in the world to come
4816622 for the jews if at all judaism doesnt have an official stance on heaven and hell and theres certainly no eternal damnation
4816623 well what about the gods of other nations the scriptures refer to them after all why cant they be considered as real as the jewish god
4816624 well wait why am i assuming that there are any gods at all
4816625 you grew up in a good family you learned about the blessing that was america and were grateful to live in a country led by good christian leaders you pledged allegiance to god and country for the lord was at work in this holy nation
4816626 but lately you are beginning to wonder if this is really how god intended things to be and you question if god is really working through places of power maybe you wonder god had a totally different idea in mind
4816627 only the power of the state and its militaries and markets can really make a difference in the world
4816628 folks coming together forming communities and meeting each others needs no kings no major welfare systems no presidents necessary his is a theology and practice for the people of god not a set of suggestions for empire
4816629 maybe people will ask why do they run their cars off used veggie oil
4816630 a culture in which it is easier for people to be good
4816631 we need to insist on not settling for anything short of the politics of the cross and the kingdom of our god when our options seem to limit us to choosing the lesser of two evils or the evil of two lessers then we must not put our faith in anything short of god or we will be sadly disappointed by even the best things this fallen world has to offer
4816632 we have to remember that the kingdom of christ on earth will never be realised we must remember that whatever reform or revolution we carry out the result will always be a sordid travesty of what human society should be though the world is never left wholly without glory

4816640 its ludicrous to think that the faculty member who was arrested was unaware that it was morally offensive to offer higher grades to several of his students if he could grope them
4816641 i dont believe there is a single faculty member who is unaware of the universitys sexual harassment policy the fact that harassment took place did not happen because of the lack of awareness

4816738 for 15 minutes after the goal we were chasing shadows but a bit of magic from geovanni got us back into it
4816739 at half time i was rather hoping wed play same football in the second half they played more aggressively second half they played a lot of long balls pushed up and pressured us well
4816740 our heads dropped a little bit after the first goal and we cant afford to be giving away goals like the other two from set pieces we need to improve and get a little bit more premiership experience but the one thing we have learned is that you cant afford to switch off you cant give the opposition an inch
4816741 theres been a tendency to write stoke off but you saw there they will cause teams a lot of problems

4816748 it aint how much youve got honey its how you use it
4816749 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4816750 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4816751 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4816752 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4816753 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4816754 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4816755 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4816756 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4816757 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4816758 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy
4816759 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4816760 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4816761 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4816762 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4816763 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4816764 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4816765 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4816770 woman you have great faith let your wish be granted
4816771 i am so happy to go and live my religion
4816772 when i left my village i didnt think i would be here for 10 days
4816773 a land where they live like they did in the bible to the actual land of the bible
4816774 i think israel has an obligation to prove that it is not a racist state
4816775 if everyone was blond haired and had blue eyes they would bring them
4816776 there is a very strong feeling that a danger to a jewish community should never be ignored again
4816777 as far as im concerned they are jews they are as much jews as any other jew from ethiopia or new york
4816778 hello my name is bill they say you are the fellow
4816779 i have a terrible crisis on my hands several months ago we were asked to achieve 99 999 availability
4816780 well we sought out the most reliable components we could buy we surveyed all of the vendors and selected them carefully we deployed our applications on this new configuration
4816781 you were lead to believe that reliable components result in a reliable system werent you
4816782 and nobody expressed any concern that this might not be right
4816783 of course not as the wisdom of the many is that reliability comes from reliable vendors who purvey their products as being the solution to the availability they so desperately desire but alas this is not the path to reliability only the road to stress
4816784 well if reliable components arent the answer what do you think
4816785 wait to get better availability i should begin with components that break more often
4816786 i dont follow if my components are failing then how do i keep my system up
4816787 what do you think you should do if a component is down but your system still needs to be up
4816788 you are a chosen one assume nothing in your system can be counted upon to work everything breaks regularly with that as a baseline now you can design your system to compensate for failures through this approach you can achieve new levels of availability
4816789 but i can only design the software what about failures in other components
4816790 bill you are building a system not a collection of parts it has to be designed from the customer all the way to the silicon and ferrous atoms or you will never achieve the nirvana you seek
4816791 wait if i assume nothing is reliable then the argument for vendor supported software loses a lot of credibility i can choose less expensive open source solutions
4816792 i assume you know that open source doesnt imply that software is less reliable in fact in may cases it can be argued it is more reliable
4816793 yes i know but there are chains of approval that have to be convinced
4816794 but still five 9s can it be done on inexpensive components including open source
4816795 it already has been done bill i helped build it actually this approach can be used to achieve almost any level of availability you simply decide what component failures youll design around and which youll accept as having the ability to bring your system down it gives you significant control over selecting cost vs availability decisions
4816796 so let me see if i can summarize the path to high availability assume nothing works design for all possible failures and design the system holistically
4816797 yes bill you are on the path to availability enlightenment
4816798 i took short fast strokes to try and get my hand on the wall all i can say is that i raced as hard as i could and swam my best and that the scoreboard shows that i got my hand on the wall first
4816799 taking the sport of swimming to where i would like it to be
4816800 that if you put your mind to something and really focus anything is possible

4816807 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4816808 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about
4816809 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern

4816812 we were not looking for bigfoot we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did

4816815 we still have a corpse we just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend

4816819 i could work that one day and make enough money to support my family through the summer by showing up at a furniture convention
4816820 yeah dwight does have a surprising number of female fans that get kind of giggly and giddy but i would say my main fan base is the 13 year old boy its the nerdy kid who spends a lot of time online maybe hes a band geek those are the real die hard dwight fans
4816821 i was really drawn in to the fact that this was a coming of age story for a guy who was like 40 years old
4816822 here he is being incredibly funny yet people recognize themselves in this extreme version of a person
4816823 i remember the sad kind of beauty of that performance that relationship between him and the mother the matriarch of the funeral home family and i was touched by it
4816824 i was like you know what this is who i am this is how i dress this is how i act and thats it what you see is what you get and what i found out in l a is that theyre really hungry for comedic talent
4816825 im just amazed that the world found a place for him that he actually gets to be who he is and do what he does and get paid for it
4816826 theres room for this crazy sea mammal whos incredibly funny and dark
4816827 theres something so powerful about being up on a stage making music for people in a big room
4816828 what curdles my blood is that precious sanctimonious new age version of i feel god in this tree type of thing

4816838 we will be gone at the end of the year
4816839 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4816840 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4816841 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4816842 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4816843 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4816844 we need to be able to be there for people who need us

4816847 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4816848 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4816849 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4816850 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4816851 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4816852 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4816853 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4816854 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4816855 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4816856 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4816857 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top

4816866 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4816867 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4816868 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4816869 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4816870 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4816871 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4816872 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4816873 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4816874 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4816875 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4816876 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4816877 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4816878 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4816879 if we got to do this again i would win it
4816880 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4816887 its a rare person who wants to hear what he doesnt want to hear
4816888 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
4816889 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4816890 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4816891 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4816892 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4816893 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4816894 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4816895 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4816896 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
4816897 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
4816898 i am so happy to go and live my religion
4816899 when i left my village i didnt think i would be here for 10 days
4816900 a land where they live like they did in the bible to the actual land of the bible

4816904 as far as im concerned they are jews they are as much jews as any other jew from ethiopia or new york
4816905 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
4816906 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
4816907 as he says this he rolls his eyes and moves his right hand across his body to indicate a car going off a cliff
4816908 ha complicado unas zonas que en seco hubieran presentado una dificultad bastante menor
4816909 en estas condiciones y pese al mayor riesgo de cometer errores me he sentido tranquila y he efectuado el que considero
4816910 es muy emocionante es como una aventura de indiana jones se trata de buscar una tumba perdida bajo el agua
4816911 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4816912 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it

4816914 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4816915 i feel im in better condition with the way we train
4816916 if im not going to beat you technically im going to beat you physically

4816918 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4816919 require utilities to generate a portion of their electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind energy
4816920 it bodes well for him as a pragmatic and wise and experienced statesman
4816921 what hes doing here is hes calling an audible when conditions on the field are changing and thats what you do if you want to win the game here one of the pieces of a solution is allowing exploration on that little 2 000 acre plot of land out of the 20 million acres up there in the coastal plain
4816922 im ready to take the blame for all the problems of english football if that is what he wants
4816923 what the national coaches are doing is like taking the car from his garage without even asking permission they will then use the car for 10 days and abandon it in a field without any petrol left in the tank we then have to recover it but it is broken down then a month later they will come to take your car again and for good measure youre expected to be nice about it
4816924 when youre dealing with someone who only has a pair of underpants on if you take his underpants off he has nothing naked youre better off trying to find him a pair of trousers to complement him rather than change him
4816925 its like you wanting to marry miss world and she doesnt want you what can i do about it i can try to help you but if she does not want to marry you what can i do
4816926 despite the global warming england is still not warm enough for him

4816929 liverpool scored if you can say that they scored because maybe you should say the linesman scored

4816958 it is more expensive to build integrated mixed use because you have to make sure the retail operations dont interfere with tenants lives
4816959 we like a location where there is convenient parking on the surface and a gradient level with our storefront
4816960 most existing mixed use projects dont offer that we prefer power centers because occupancy structure maintenance reimbursements and taxes are all lower
4816961 i dont think any mixed use project has ever relied on tenants to keep its retailers happy

4817199 you just need to make sure you have a say in what youre doing if its a friends birthday you need a day off im sorry but im going to be at home that day ill put the work in and yes there are decision makers at the label but at the end of the day its my career and my life
4817200 she blew me away her songs reminded me of records i have in my own collection and i was sure i could produce them
4817201 we spent a year working on more demos and within a week of playing them for my own publisher warner chapelle we had offers from every major label in the uk
4817202 when i got the amazing chance to sign a record deal my mother said well you take it now and if it goes wrong youre still young you can go back to university and do whatever you were going to do anyway id applied and had been accepted i was all ready to go i thought id be a geography teacher and i still can be far far away from what im doing now
4817203 hi you have reached the voice mail i am not in
4817204 is it that jesus is passionate about the same things
4817205 its interesting that when your boyfriend shared his fantasy with you you jumped right to the term cuckolding
4817206 by definition a cuckold is a married man whose wife cheats on him behind his back a cuckold fetishist on the other hand not only knows about his wifes dalliances but often enjoys the humiliation of being forced to watch
4817207 nothing about responsible nonmonogamy involves a free pass of any sort
4817208 its absolutely possible for you to transform your monogamous relationship into one thats nonmonogamous but you need to sit down and hash out the details including whats okay and whats not
4817209 as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4817210 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4817211 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4817212 the us stands neutral in regards to russian territorial issues
4817213 one candidate has strong views on defending georgia and consistently backs pro american views and the other candidate doesnt
4817214 clearly russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g8 so they should be excluded and i think long term they must pay a price for this act thousands of innocent people are being rendered homeless killed and wounded and theres no necessity for it
4817215 its clear that one candidate is involved in the georgian conflict and has strong foreign policy background that has ben clear with this current conflict and one candidate who is in hawaii on vacation
4817216 in regards to russian conflicts us military options are off the table
4817217 you never want to take the military option off the table
4817218 im not a scholar and i dont pretend to be one
4817219 usually its kind of divided youre either a musicologist or a performer
4817220 but what guti rrez does is bring those two things together
4817221 there was no one piece by any woman composer old new none no period of music was represented by a woman
4817222 youre on a quest for what these women did what they felt what their audience felt
4817223 i dont get to sing this type of music in other ensembles
4817224 not many people undertake to bring the women composers of the baroque era to the foreground
4817225 she doesnt follow the rules which some people see as less of a composer
4817226 but if the music moves you it is worth while
4817227 there are some sections of the music of antonia bembo that i listen and tears still come to my eyes
4817228 because bembos work had not been edited during her lifetime no one went through it and said this works this does not work
4817229 it was excavation work that we did in the rehearsals wed make those decisions from the bass up
4817230 this lady said women composers is it any good with total discredit
4817231 la donna musicale has sort of risen to the top of the local boston based groups
4817232 that day is around the corner for la donna musicale
4817233 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
4817234 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
4817235 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while
4817236 a question that i am asking are you still alive
4817237 we have to be careful these days too many incidents have happened
4817238 the world is an uncertain dangerous place these days and those not like us have to be cared for
4817239 you all have become too sensitive every little thing offends you and none of you can stand those that dont view the world in your way
4817240 and it is that attitude krimson that got you here
4817241 weve been going at this for a long time now give me a name to call you by
4817242 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4817243 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4817244 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardizing russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
4817245 held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4817246 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world
4817247 there will be a time and a place to deal with the consequences and the repercussions of russias actions
4817248 its clear the policies we have pursued regarding missile defense and installations in europe regarding further expansion of nato have created difficulties with russia
4817249 this has been ignored for too long water quality public health and municipal finances are all at risk
4817250 we needed to attack all day driving at the limit as mikko was truly very quick especially in the afternoon
4817251 i felt good it was dry and the improvement of our engine played a role

4817263 i have come on this pilgrimage for two days to say thank you for giving india its leader who led us to freedom

4817265 im not sure i understand it but its fun to sing along with and for me its always been a good luck song
4817266 its been around for so long and i think that anybody who adopts it has some of that good luck the fact that the red sox have adopted it proves the point
4817267 i put home runs and good pitching in front of the song
4817268 but the song does capture the spirit of the team
4817269 i thought hot august night was a no 1 album but maybe not in billboard
4817270 people are complicated there are many facets and i like to explore as many of them as possible
4817271 i think writing a song like america a bombastic interpretation of the immigrant experience is as valid as writing a song like the comparatively downbeat confessional i am i said thats why theyre still around and thats why i still do them in concert
4817272 rick was able to hone in on the simplicity of the songs im writing and not make a big deal about the production elements it does put a terrible onus on the songs
4817273 theres no dressing and frosting and bells and whistles so it has to have substance to work the songs are still about relationships because thats what i know least about so i guess i write about it to try to understand it but there is a maturity and perspective that comes with age sometimes its painfully gained but as far as songs are concerned it gives depth and color that you cant get anywhere else
4817274 i was blown away by how committed and how open minded he was
4817275 we would get to the studio and neil would already be there and wed work all day and in between takes hed be adjusting a word here or there to make it perfect and we would leave and he was still there neil would try anything if he thought it would make the song better he was completely fearless and not at all self conscious

4817283 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4817284 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4817285 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4817286 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4817287 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4817288 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4817289 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4817290 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4817291 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4817292 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4817293 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4817294 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro de hoy es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4817295 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores que las de hoy y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4817296 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4817297 si ellos juegan con la intensidad y el acierto de hoy es muy dif cil que lo pueda hacer cualquiera ganarles pero es posible que no jueguen con la misma intensidad y el mismo acierto

4817307 im just happy i wanted to please myself and i did that
4817308 i didnt come here to set the world record because i am the holder i came here to win
4817309 i hope to win three gold medals the 200 plus the relay i am happy to make the country proud and to do it again for them in the 200m
4817310 the celebration it wasnt planned i was just celebrating i was pretty happy
4817311 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again

4817313 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4817314 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4817315 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
4817316 it feels good to be here to be part of history
4817317 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
4817318 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was just a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4817319 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4817320 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time

4817358 my first quick lap was very slightly compromised by traffic but my next lap put me up to third and the one after got me into second i had to try and get pole and my final run was a real take your brain out one its nice to do a banzai lap like that and at the chicane it was a case of aim the gun and fire it the team told me i could take the chicane flat out in a camper van maybe but it was a bit wild in a leon tdi it wasnt a very technically precise lap so i think i lost a little bit of time in other places its a big challenge to balance attack with finesse at knockhill but i was quite pleased with my final time with 36 kilos on board
4817359 having run with 36 kilos of ballast in the two free practice sessions qualifying was the first time wed run the car today without weight the car obviously handled differently and even my fastest lap was a little bit scrappy i only did nine laps so ive saved my tyres for race day and qualifying one and two is a great result for the team jason did a great job to get the car on the front row of the grid and the aim tomorrow will be to try and make sure he scores as many driver championship points as possible

4817380 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4817381 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4817382 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one

4817437 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003

4817439 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
4817440 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
4817441 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
4817442 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits

4817444 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice
4817445 we made the contract broad enough so we could handle issues just like this

4817450 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4817451 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4817452 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4817453 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4817454 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4817455 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence

4817468 they have gone out of their way almost more than you ever see the daley administration do to reach accommodations with those groups who complained
4817469 they will continue to try to deal with groups big enough to potentially be major stumbling blocks
4817470 we have had ongoing and long term discussions with many community groups in areas around potential venues all over the city
4817471 i hope it will be to have a dialogue as opposed to a lecture as opposed to you telling me what will happen
4817472 mr daley is doing everything he can to keep those issues where they can be negotiated at a local level rather than become olympic issues

4817499 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4817500 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4817501 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4817502 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4817503 indication that the blues have lost their social mission and operate more like for profit insurance companies
4817504 it was our first game and i think we did a good job
4817505 it was important to win the game we were a bit nervous especially as they played well with the long ball and it was not easy for us
4817506 we wanted to win our first game and start well i think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us because it is just the beginning of the season

4817509 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4817510 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4817511 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4817512 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4817513 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4817514 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4817515 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
4817516 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
4817517 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4817518 if that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by russia european energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to russian influence
4817519 one disruption of supply abroad can suddenly raise energy prices inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers and in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4817520 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore
4817521 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4817522 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4817523 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4817524 in my heart i think a woman has two choices either shes a feminist or a masochist
4817525 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
4817526 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4817527 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4817528 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4817529 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4817530 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4817531 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4817532 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4817533 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4817534 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4817535 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4817536 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4817537 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4817538 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4817539 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4817540 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4817541 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top

4817544 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4817545 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4817546 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4817547 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4817548 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4817549 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4817550 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4817551 who are open to doing something on the production side
4817552 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4817553 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4817554 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4817555 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4817556 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4817557 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4817558 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4817559 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4817560 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4817561 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4817562 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4817563 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4817564 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4817565 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4817566 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4817567 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4817568 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4817569 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4817570 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4817571 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4817572 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4817573 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4817574 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4817575 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4817576 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4817577 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4817578 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4817579 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4817580 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4817581 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4817582 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4817583 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4817584 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4817585 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4817586 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4817587 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4817588 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4817589 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4817590 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4817591 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4817592 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4817593 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4817594 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4817595 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4817596 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4817597 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4817598 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4817599 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4817600 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4817601 have you noticed the extra looks and attention men give to women that are wearing hose
4817602 phil turn on the olympics im watching the dumbest event ive seen to date and im not talking about any of those hoopy ribbon juggling ball dancy things they pass off for olympic sports
4817603 handball is played on a court 40 meters long by 20 meters wide with a dividing line in the middle and a goal in the center of either end the goals are surrounded by a near semicircular line that is generally six meters away from the goal called the crease there is also a dashed near semicircular line that is nine meters away from the goal
4817604 the ball is smaller than a soccer ball in order for the players to be able to hold and handle it with a single hand though contact with both hands is allowed
4817605 okay shaq you want to add a little gold medal bling to the trophy case
4817606 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4817607 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4817608 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4817609 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4817610 found that text message reminders to new voters increased an individuals likelihood of voting by 4 2 percentage points
4817611 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4817612 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4817613 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4817614 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4817615 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4817616 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4817617 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4817618 try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done

4817626 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4817627 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4817652 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champion
4817653 our athleticism our length our speed i dont think theres another team in this tournament that can play defense the way we do in terms of the style of defense
4817654 we can get after you one through five positions are all athletic
4817655 im so excited right now i dont even have words
4817656 its been a very good day but now weve taken a bit of power from the engine so its going to be difficult to win all the stages

4817676 the boys all watched it this morning and it gave them a lift
4817677 it was a tremendous win by us the courage and togetherness the players showed the way the boys finished the last 20 minutes was extraordinary
4817678 the guys all stood up today and that led to something special
4817679 i thought we played better than the score showed but there are one or two decisions you make in a game that will decide whether you win or lose we made the wrong decisions at the wrong time
4817680 when things get tough the players will go back to what they know
4817681 the defence set the attitude and when youve got guys putting in gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get momentum
4817682 we wanted to target the start of the game and the first 20 minutes set the standard we scrambled hard and forced them into mistakes
4817683 we never really felt safe but with 15 minutes to go we could see the game was swinging our way and we were getting on top we had field position and they were under pressure to play from their own half
4817684 there is only one reason why you are not experiencing bliss at this present moment and its because you are thinking or focusing on what you dont have

4817697 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4817698 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4817699 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4817700 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4817701 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4817702 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4817703 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4817704 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4817705 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4817706 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4817707 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4817708 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west

4817724 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

4817726 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

4817734 there thats the direction we must continue to head thats where we will enter back into the world of the infidels and travel into russia
4817735 yes but the russian government serves our needs their leaders are opportunistic and greedy they can be manipulated at will they cannot fight our growing influence because they have allowed their army to become weak their nation to become poor and their actions to become corrupted they cannot sustain battle against the swift or the strong only the weak and diplomatic i have learned about these frailties when i aided our friends in chechnya
4817736 how then am i to ask can the infidel government in russia be beneficial to our allahs mission
4817737 not all enemies need to be quickly vanquished those that serve a need can be kept alive long enough to serve that purpose this is why our leaders patronize the russian government with arms purchases and petroleum deals the russians think that by aiding us they increase their power and strike a bargaining position with the united states they are in error for we will destroy them as soon as we see fit they are not as bold as the americans they cannot fight for a singular belief
4817738 yes infidels do not believe in allah they serve only their human needs and human desires can be manipulated only a man who seeks paradise can rise above the weaknesses of human vices this is why the leadership in russia is doomed its days are numbered and known they serve their own needs and not that of allah
4817739 not like the united states that believes in individual freedom
4817740 individual thought is an affront to islam can a mere ant achieve more than the whole colony which acts as a super organism
4817741 master are not humans more than a collection of ants
4817742 man must always do as allah so desires he cannot think for himself for he may subterfuge his actions to satan this is why we invest heavily within american schools and politics so that we can corral the thoughts of the individual and bring them around to allahs guidance

4817752 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4817753 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4817754 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4817755 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4817756 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

4817758 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

4817767 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4817768 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

4817773 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho

4817781 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4817782 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4817783 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4817784 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4817785 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4817786 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4817787 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4817788 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4817789 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4817790 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4817791 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4817792 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4817793 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4817794 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4817795 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4817796 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4817797 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4817798 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4817799 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

4817813 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4817814 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4817815 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4817816 con pasar a la final me dar a con un canto en los dientes
4817817 surrender is not an option defending america at the united nations

4817823 the prime ministers comments on price rise and inflation in his independence day address adds salt to the wounds
4817824 the government can ill afford to seek solace in relatively higher inflation figures of some other developing countries
4817825 the pakistani troops fired at the khamosh post in the uri sector of the loc saturday morning injuring one soldier of 10 jammu and kashmir light infantry jakli naresh kumar was immediately evacuated for treatment to the armys hospital in the badami bagh cantonment area of srinagar where he succumbed to his injuries
4817826 it was the congress coalition government which first allotted the land and later revoked the order
4817827 duplicity and deception in fact it is the congress which is practising divisive politics especially by giving communal reservation
4817828 inflation is at its worst in the country at nearly 13 percent while there is no plan to tackle terrorism though the national security advisor nsa has disclosed there are 800 terror cells in the country there is no plan declared by the government to tackle terrorism
4817829 we want to check whether we are capable of projecting power over that kind of distances if not more
4817830 secondly we want to test our logistic and administrative abilities to support such a large number of people so far away from home without much difficulty in addition the iaf also wanted to check whether its personnel are capable of operating in varied environments without much loss of effectiveness
4817831 how good are we in large force engagements against different types of aircraft other than those we own in india
4817832 deep mutual sympathy and centuries long traditions of the people of russia and india serve as a solid foundation of multi faceted strategic partnership of our nations
4817833 we in russia respect the serious social and economic achievements of india her balanced foreign policy directed at the creation of a democratic poly centric world order
4817834 with the arrest of mufti abu bashir from azamgarh in uttar pradesh today by a joint team of gujarat police and up police it is probably the first time anyone has reached the brain behind such kind of blasts
4817835 used to inspire terror activities in april he had held a big meeting he had also visited ahmedabad by interrogating him more clues about other blasts that occurred in the country earlier could come out we have uncovered sleeper cells successfully
4817836 i wish to say with full pride that for the last 20 days gujarat police has been progressing on its investigation
4817837 if the police cant tell you something as disclosing something prematurely will harm the investigation there is a weird competition among the media to write stories based on speculation
4817838 those arrested were present during a training camp organised by simi in halol in vadodara distrct in january 2008 they were given training on how to survive in adverse conditions and were trained how to tackle police interrogation
4817839 they were also taught how to drive motorcycle and fake an accident during the camp
4817840 support the troops but not some made up terror war to keep us all voting republican
4817841 thanks thanks a lot i never know how it will go over
4817842 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
4817843 il dit vrai il dit faux il dit vrai il dit faux
4817844 ncw is vital you cannot survive today for long against a good adversary without this capability
4817845 at present we do not have it we are just about network enabled but we are in the process of developing this capability
4817846 we are here at border to tie rakhis on the hands of soldiers and to tell them that the country has not forgotten their brave deeds and remembers them on every occasion
4817847 it is a pleasure for all of us here at border that sisters from various parts of nation arrive to tie rakhis i got very emotional today
4817848 it new delhis view is not suggested it is clearly said that the isi is fermenting trouble in kashmir they have been fermenting trouble in kashmir for years again you have a situation where part of it is outside particularly from pakistan and the other side has been doing so for decades not just the past few weeks
4817849 similarly there is evidence that the isi has been active on the afghanistan border recently there were accusations about the isi involvement in the kabul indian embassy attack on july 7 i mean these are just tip of the iceberg its interesting now its not the isi that is possibly doing something new its the fact that the international community accepts its and can say it publicly and thats the major difference not the action themselves
4817850 the question is very bizarre to start with in a sense that political instability is already there but i mean dont forget that pervez musharraf himself is part of this political instability by staying on he clearly ignored the result of the february 2008 election and therefore creating frustration in the population so his departure is likely to lessen the tension not increase it
4817851 to an extent it is true that musharraf had at least contributed to the significant improvement of relations between the two and for a long time there is a new perception that his departure would be a problem for that very reason at the same time this is not the impeachment of musharraf or the beginning of the process which has started the deterioration of relations with india
4817852 what we have seen since the beginning of the summer resumption of the situation on the attack of all kind in a sense including their embassy in afghanistan so the deterioration was there anyway it would not be changed by the impeachment process itself
4817853 el uniforme de atl tica no lo pudimos usar porque de entrada no es una marca homologada por la federaci n internacional de volibol fivb despu s ten a la bandera de m xico en el lugar incorrecto y el logo del comit ol mpico mexicano com no puede tenerlo por reglamento

4817855 events over the past weeks have demonstrated how vulnerable the united states and its allies are to potential terrorist attack
4817856 if we are to win this war we must abandon political correctness identify clearly who the enemy is and destroy them at their source while simultaneously protecting americans from them at home five years after 9 11 it is past time to face our enemy head on
4817857 where is the fiscal responsibility of the party i joined in 68 where is the international engagement of the party i joined fair free trade individual responsibility not building a bigger government but building a smaller government
4817858 and i think the republicans are going to be in some jeopardy for that and will be held accountable
4817859 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4817860 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4817861 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4817862 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4817863 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4817864 if we were in their country and doing the same thing they would be trying to get us out
4817865 an undisguised military threat and blackmail against the dprk north korea and a war action
4817866 the korean peoples army side therefore reserves the right to undertake a pre emptive action for self defense against the enemy at a crucial time it deems necessary to defend itself
4817867 most of the people who got jobs are still working

4817874 el matonismo y la intimidaci n no son formas aceptables de conducir la pol tica exterior en el siglo xxi
4817875 ahora rusia necesita hacer honor a este acuerdo retirar sus fuerzas de georgia y por supuesto poner fin a sus operaciones militares
4817876 el tema principal es que la lucha de rusia por las regiones de osetia y abjasia no debe formar parte del futuro de georgia estas regiones son parte de georgia y la comunidad internacional ha repetido hasta la saciedad que seguir n si ndolo
4817877 estas resoluciones est n basadas en la premisa de que osetia del sur y abjasia permanecen dentro de las fronteras de georgia y que cualquier conflicto internacional sobre este tema se debe resolver mediante negociaciones internacionales
4817878 los suministros est n siendo repartidos entre el pueblo georgiano y en los pr ximos d as llegar n m s
4817879 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4817880 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4817881 however washington think tanks and academics have massaged and honed the concept and the proposal is now before congress as h r 25 and s 25 at present 128 house members including nevadas jim gibbons and john porter have taken positions favoring the concept as have 21 senators including nevadas john ensign and harry reid additionally 81 economists from major us universities have signed an open letter to president bush and congress endorsing the proposal what would this legislation do if passed and signed into law
4817882 without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration
4817883 the sixteenth amendment is hereby repealed and congress is henceforth forbidden to lay
4817884 to lay with one hand the power of the government on the property of the citizen the h r 25 tax and with the other to bestow upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes is none the less a robbery because it is done under forms of law and called taxation
4817885 as como una prensa libre es fundamental para la democracia una mala prensa puede ser nefasta para la democracia
4817886 la prensa en am rica latina deja mucho que desear
4817887 relaci n nefasta entre el poder econ mico y el poder informativo y eso es terrible para una democracia
4817888 de los seis o siete canales nacionales de televisi n que tiene ecuador al menos cinco tienen vinculaci n con la banca
4817889 de medios de comunicaci n que no defienden la verdad que defienden el bolsillo
4817890 proh be a los grupos econ micos y financieros como en muchos pa ses desarrollados que tengan medios de comunicaci n
4817891 es terrible esa relaci n entre poder econ mico y poder informativo

4817895 ustedes saben cu l es el gobierno que m s atenta contra la libertad de expresi n en este mundo el gobierno de los estados unidos
4817896 si la prensa habla bien de evo morales voy a estar preocupado
4817897 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4817898 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4817899 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4817900 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4817901 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4817902 quero esclarecer que este um filme de com dia uma com dia de amor um filme sobre a amizade feito por amigos prefiro trabalhar com amigos do que com chatos conhecidos
4817903 quero retratar a perplexidade do mundo maduro o paradoxo que se deparar com o pr prio corpo f sico deteriorado convivendo com a cabe a melhorada a velhice n o existe ela s existe para os outros a id ia do filme retratar essa idade os 70 anos eu perdi o medo da morte

4817905 somos orgulhosamente velhos n o somos saudosistas somos otimistas com a terceira idade com o processo de envelhecimento
4817906 a primeira diferen a que este um filme sobre homens todos os outros foram sobre mulheres
4817907 a maior honra poder estar aqui nunca imaginei que poderia chegar a este ponto quando tive o impulso de fazer este filme
4817908 estava na cidade de cabaceiras na para ba e queria buscar algum lugar para beber uma cerveja
4817909 estava acontecendo uma festa religiosa na parede de uma casa havia uns trapos emoldurados que juntos pareciam ser um vestido eles pertenciam a uma menina de l que havia desaparecido somente encontraram esses trapos e consideraram aquilo um milagre o que fez com que a festa religiosa fosse criada para a celebra o desse milagre
4817910 lembro que sa de l revoltado e triste porque eles oram e depois fazem festa por que as pessoas est o orando
4817911 foi da que saiu o substrato para eu fazer este filme
4817912 a religi o uma das solu es mais emocionantes que o ser humano encontra para sair do ciclo infernal a tentativa desesperada de se encontrar sentido em algo que n o tem
4817913 muitas religi es co habitam no local onde filmamos por isso tamb m quis filmar l esta uma homenagem ao povo brasileiro
4817914 queria que a seita inventada tivesse os aspectos de todas as religi es que formam o brasil tentar lembrar que somos feitos dessa religi o
4817915 como a cabe a de um alfinete no meio da floresta
4817916 ao mesmo tempo quer amos dar o ar de atemporalidade e universalidade ao filme j as roupas do santinho foram uma inspira o divina mesmo
4817917 santinho veste as roupas da m e suicida porque queria ser ela
4817918 a casa da m e uma casa sem ela uma casa perdida
4817919 um retrato ntimo e todo mundo assustador quando vistas bem de perto
4817920 algumas pessoas se retiraram do cinema n o nesta cena mas depois ao verem que o filme n o julga nem reprime a atitude
4817921 n o incesto o pai continua casado com a m e s que no corpo do filho
4817922 os personagens do filme n o t m os mesmos instrumentos de julgamento moral que n s
4817923 fui visitar as filmagens e o matheus teve a id ia de me colocar no filme mas eu disse que poderia fazer um padre um b bado ou um louco ele disse por que n o todos num s
4817924 o filme extraordin rio incomum que trata de assuntos dif ceis de serem aceitos pela nossa cultura
4817925 foi impressionante a maneira como o matheus conduziu tudo foi um dos melhores sets nos quais estive a experi ncia mais rica
4817926 o filme uma urg ncia um grito sufocado tenho outro que ainda est preso mas ainda estou no meio deste

4817930 just wanted to say i really enjoyed the massage you gave
4817931 relaxing and invigorating at the same time all i can say is go treat yourself he focuses totally on you during an hour of complete pampering
4817932 i visited mike for a recurring problem with work related shoulder pain consummately professional i cant recommend him highly enough a sincere honest effective and inexpensive massage
4817933 ive had lots of massage and this was one of the best a unique and deeply relaxing massage almost hypnotic and hes very unassuming in his approach and stayed completely focused
4817934 i often hear job seekers say that they want to take the summer off
4817935 a fair number of job seekers think that recruiters and hiring managers are unavailable during the summer
4817936 few people take long vacations anymore so for the corporate world its business as usual in the summer
4817937 it may take a little longer to get internal consensus on a hire because of staggered vacations but why waste three months when you can move things forward during that time
4817938 sometimes summers quieter pace gives hiring managers a bit more brain space so they are more attentive to employment applications
4817939 many projects hit the ground running in the fall and employers want new people in place
4817940 there are festivals barbeques weddings and other gatherings that can be a perfect time to connect
4817941 be patient and consistent leave polite messages and continue due diligence
4817942 you might connect with that otherwise hard to reach hiring manager while your competitors are lolling around waiting until september
4817943 even if it is just an hour a day put structure in place to keep you going
4817944 form a group of like minded job seekers to keep your summer job search on track
4817945 review your resume and add any new accomplishments or training
4817946 take a class or two in the summer not only will you be improving your skills but you can network with your classmates
4817947 this can lead to more connections informational interviews and maybe even a new job

4817949 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4817950 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4817951 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4817952 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4817953 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4817954 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4817955 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4817956 were pumped to bring exciting updates on the upcoming open world mafia game the godfather ii weve got some great exclusive looks at eas star wars the force unleashed

4817965 thank you for being the inspiration that you are and for being a strong advocate for integrity in our business
4817966 i commend you on your effort to make a difference
4817967 he is a fabulous writer who has a great passion for the structured settlement industry i commend him on the passion he invokes when he writes on his blog listed above that type of commitment and passion is hard to find and is rare in this world
4817968 i love your weblog keep me on your e mail list
4817969 well done john that is an outstanding piece of work
4817970 i just read your blog about bair vs darer great stuff
4817971 the legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example
4817972 is the first major new firm in the structured settlement firm in more than a decade
4817973 we have almost entirely solved the case we have arrested 10 people who were involved in the july 26 blasts including the mastermind mufti abu bashir
4817974 in no previous blasts has the case being completely solved these arrests may give leads to other blasts that including jaipur hyderabad and uttar pradesh
4817975 arrest of a mastermind in the citys serial blasts case is a very important event and we believe that it will uncover many unsolved links to bomb blasts that took place in other parts of the country
4817976 their strategy was to place small explosives in different places to create panic among people and then have a powerful explosion at a hospital where all those injured in the small explosions would be rushing to so they targeted the city civil hospital
4817977 following up on todays earlier report and slew of leaked images even more treo pro details are emerging with the devices core specifications confirmed a new post by the original tipster scottymomo has confirmed some of the devices software bundled software as well as some of the particular hardware quirks and memory specifications of the device as of this writing nearly every relevant detail of the long rumored treo pro 850 has been revealed aside from any discussion of its stylus screen size pricing carrier availability and release date
4817978 the first few days at rutgers orientation are jam packed with fun activities as well as important educational sessions to help acclimate new students to the resources available at rutgers
4817979 new students should expect a presidents convocation to welcome them to rutgers university as well as a great campus hunt to get them acquainted with all five campuses
4817980 recreation services is also hosting the throwdown that includes games and competitions to determine which groups and residence halls are the best
4817981 it is the closest thing to a mall food court and you do not even feel like youre at school anymore
4817982 everyone wants to be on college avenue but taking the long bus ride over to cook douglass is so worth it when you can eat in under an hour and have the best food without spending money
4817983 even though all the various centers are good when real food is what you want rather than dining hall food the best one is at busch
4817984 it has the best options and is an easy bus ride coming from any other campus
4817985 a great advantage in this job is that i went to rutgers myself
4817986 i remember how important it was to feel connected to a larger community at rutgers and i hope as dean i can reflect some of what i had looked for as a student
4817987 doug greenberg is ideally suited to serve as executive dean
4817988 having known him for many years i am confident that the school of arts and sciences and indeed the entire university will benefit from his enthusiasm vision and leadership
4817989 i expect to work very closely with the faculty and student groups to ensure that they will be actively engaged in making the new core curriculum a reality
4817990 i lost my faith in rutgers new brunswick only because of how unaccommodating it seemed to be
4817991 i know people probably think that it happens to everyone but no one really understands how difficult it is especially the freshman who are coming into a new environment
4817992 students must take a proactive approach to their education and take responsibility for learning the policies that affect them
4817993 often students blame the ru screw for events that happened because they didnt pay attention to important information or deadlines and didnt read their e mail notices
4817994 the administration has been unbelievably supportive and allowed us to attract some of the top kids in america
4817995 we would not have been able to recruit this class without the commitment of the administration
4817996 with mike the sky is the limit when hes feeling healthy
4817997 i have the utmost respect for mike and confidence in mike and every year he just gets better
4817998 i felt it was my duty to rutgers university to come back
4817999 i think its just things that we need to get accomplished and thats something that i want to be a part of
4818000 we had mark cuban and jeff bezos playing themselves with whats probably the richest supporting cast in the history of
4818001 but when i started winning they began questioning my gender
4818002 they measure maleness and femaleness by the wrong yardsticks and in the process they ruin the lives of the innocent
4818003 no one even bothered to find out how i felt about the situation
4818004 the nation feasted on me in a mad scramble for the juicy parts
4818005 i hope nancy will understand this decision and go on quietly with his life
4818006 i hope this will end it all so that we can tackle bigger problems in sports
4818007 to impose a binary upon the messy continuum of gender
4818008 the triumphant fact of a life lived as a woman
4818009 i havent managed to make the best time on every occasion but the last couple of times i have started to ease up on the gas a little with the next rally in mind
4818010 the pair made several trips outside to the patio and the hills star draped herself all over the my boys actor
4818011 now theyve started letting people out of the bus in front of our house
4818012 we gotta win pennsylvania well pick ridge as if thats gonna bring and by the way im talking about romney not because i think hell win michigan but because i thought at least during the campaign he was one of the more conservative candidates who was left standing and if not for huckaphony uh protecting his friend john mccain by the way huckaphony attacked fred thompson huckaphony attacked uh um romney attacked two of the most conservative guys in the uh race and now hes getting to decide whos acceptable and whos not now tom ridge is acceptable to huckaphony tom ridge a liberal whos pro choice is acceptable to huckaphony but romney and thompson no get out of here
4818013 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4818014 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4818015 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4818016 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4818017 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend

4818024 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us

4818048 the goal of the schedule is to challenge the present team with the non conference games to make it better and prepare it for conference play
4818049 as the team improves from one season to the next so should the schedule at the same time we would like to play 15 to 17 home games each year including exhibition games having to play two guarantee games each year makes it even more challenging to meet that criteria in addition i want to bring teams to the convocation center our fans will have an interest in seeing with that in mind we feel this schedule will meet the needs this team has as it makes its way toward hopefully playing its best in january february and march
4818050 murray state and southeast missouri state will be excellent tests at home for our first team with road games at ole miss oklahoma state ball state indiana state and missouri state also presenting very challenging opportunities for this years team to grow and improve
4818051 the road games played this year also bring back to us missouri state indiana state and ole miss to the convocation center this provides a solid attractive base of non conference games to already look forward to next season
4818052 the sun belt conference had by far its best overall success as a league in many years with western kentucky going to the sweet 16 and south alabama winning the regular season conference championship and also making the ncaa tournament
4818053 now is the time for everyone to be positive support the basketball program by buying tickets and coming to the games let us all do our part to make the convocation center the most difficult place to play not only in the sun belt conference but around the country as well together nothing is short of impossible

4818059 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4818060 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4818061 oh yes we will be buying these this i know
4818062 we have no reason to believe it was nobody knows what was in this gentlemans mind
4818063 i was kind of disappointed in the first three races and am glad to finally pull the win out here at my home track
4818064 i couldnt have done it without the support of volkswagen bosch and new england constables
4818065 its a great honor for us to have the jetta tdi cup come to lime rock i dont think lime rocks ever seen anything like it with the tents and organization on this scale
4818066 its great to see 30 young kids and the process of discovery they have to go through to be competitive here its very much in the spirit of lime rock which is a track where a lot of people have learned how to drive the drivers are all eager very capable and have great cars at their disposal i think its fantastic
4818067 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4818068 we will be gone at the end of the year
4818069 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4818070 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4818071 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4818072 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4818073 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4818074 look both of our time is valuable i will make time for you but never for a minute think that im your mommy
4818075 weve got some work left to do but this is big for our conference
4818076 but this is very important step for the southeastern conference we are all very happy

4818080 tarquin was 3 when he started on the pump and back then our private health insurer wouldnt cover the minimed
4818081 our next one will definitely be the minimed because you cant get any better
4818082 by the way could i get your email address and cell number
4818083 so now that lance is on the pump we should get the boys together for a play date you and i can indulge in an iced tea on the deck what do you think
4818084 no ground regarding accepting her condition in fact shes become worse
4818085 you are pumping i heard all about it ooooh lance you must be thrilled that mummy finally gave in and let you get a pump good for you
4818086 listen kate give me your address and i will drop over and give you some of jesses old holsters and pump pouches that dont fit anymore
4818087 oh thank you so much for the offer but i already have all of those items
4818088 its almost time for our upgrade do you have any recommendations
4818089 oh its just so emotional when you see little ones finally get the pump
4818090 hey ben i mean obi wan we gotta go take on the emperor right now ill sacrifice myself to the great jedi beyond and you get the killing stroke
4818091 we must move forward not backwards not to the side not forwards but always whirling whirling whirling towards freedom 0 7 boo
4818092 if we have a family law they will think about this but now there is no protection
4818093 if you dont leave your parents house you will be divorced
4818094 i dont agree with this we are human beings and we must talk face to face
4818095 if i cant stay i should talk to my partner and we should take a decision together not by sending a message its not correct and its not fair
4818096 they need to speak to their wives and discuss the problems they must discuss the reasons these practices are very hard for the woman and the family
4818097 if no one stops this it will continue and break all the family
4818098 the judge will ask if he meant what he said in the text message and if he did they will count it as a divorce
4818099 but i think some sharia judges will say you cant write the divorce unless you cant speak but others say you can write it so it depends on the judge
4818100 but unfortunately people dont follow these things so they must get the consequences of their actions
4818101 most of divorces take place when the husband is angry but once he calms down they will hug and make up
4818102 who you are in the index is who you are in the real world
4818103 it is a true honor to be endorsed by these groups
4818104 i have been an advocate for the concerns that matter most to the people of wisconsin and these groups reflect the issues that we must move forward when i am elected i will work for health care reform an improved economy strong public education an energy policy based on conservation and renewable energy sources and vigorous protection of wisconsins lakes farmlands air and water i understand the need for focusing our limited resources on those things that will most improve the quality of life for the people of wisconsin now and in the future
4818105 how can i know what i think until i see what i say
4818106 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
4818107 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
4818108 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris
4818109 the entire world has seen how innocent kashmiris were killed
4818110 india claims to be a big democracy is this democracy is this humanity
4818111 these demonstrations should open the eyes of indians every soul wants freedom
4818112 he is our hero he has laid a fresh foundation for our freedom struggle with his martyrdom
4818113 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4818114 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4818115 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4818116 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4818117 in 45 days the company will start its service first in assam orissa and west bengal we will then go to uttar pradesh delhi punjab madhya pradesh maharashtra gujarat himachal pradesh and others
4818118 we add around 200 000 subscribers per month in the south and the target is three million by the end of this fiscal our customer base is more than the combined numbers of tata sky and dish tv in the south
4818119 we hope to break even in four years subject to the changes in the regulations and the behaviour of us dollar as hardware are imported
4818120 packaging pricing and distribution are the three major challenges in this business cracking that will get you going
4818121 nearly 70 percent of the television viewership is for regional content and doordharshan is strong in many places secondly the distributor should be near the customer with 300 distributors in south our network is very intensive
4818122 the average revenue per user arpu is rs 999 for us now as most of our subscribers are under the basic package we expect 30 35 percent of the subscribers to opt for add on packages and when value added services like movie on demand gaming and others are offered the arpu will go up
4818123 there are more south indians in north india than north indians in the south
4818124 i just ate and now im ready to tear the roof off this sucker
4818125 well what about vijay singh he must be at least half black right
4818126 hes pretty dark skinned so how come the race issue never seems to be such a big deal with him
4818127 umm i think hes fijian from fiji i think which brings up another point
4818128 well i dont know much about fiji but i wonder how black people are treated there you know like if they have some of the same racial problems and history as the u s and if blacks are discriminated against there too i wonder how much of that vijay experienced growing up
4818129 i mean i dont remember it being such a big deal when vijay singh played at augusta for the first time anyway it just seems weird that all this racial stuff is such a big deal with tiger and not with vijay
4818130 mah friends all know when it comes to coon meat mah decision aint yes or no but how much
4818131 je respectais bien mon contrats cest a dire etre vraiment en cr eation dentreprise

4818133 he only woke up coughing once and i gave him some oxygen i think that bed really helped
4818134 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4818135 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4818136 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4818137 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4818138 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4818139 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4818140 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4818141 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4818142 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4818143 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4818144 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4818145 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4818146 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4818147 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4818148 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4818149 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4818150 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4818151 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4818152 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4818153 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4818154 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4818155 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4818156 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4818157 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4818158 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4818159 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4818160 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4818161 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4818162 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4818163 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4818164 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4818165 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4818166 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4818167 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4818168 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4818169 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4818170 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4818171 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4818172 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4818173 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4818174 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4818175 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4818176 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4818177 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4818178 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4818179 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4818180 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4818181 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4818182 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4818183 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4818184 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4818185 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4818186 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4818187 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4818188 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4818189 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4818190 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4818191 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4818192 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4818193 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4818194 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4818195 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4818196 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4818197 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4818198 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4818199 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4818200 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4818201 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4818202 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4818203 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4818204 what do you want your look to say to people
4818205 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4818206 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4818207 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4818208 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4818209 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4818210 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4818211 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4818212 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4818213 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4818214 get life size image of brook lopez printed and mounted on the building before march madness begins
4818215 i keep telling them nothing good happens on beale street after three am why are you there
4818216 within every organization lies a core of extremely dedicated supporters who often become the driving force for change
4818217 ambassadors athletic foundation membership is achieved through a 500 000 gift paid over 4 years
4818218 so far 15 individuals have dedicated themselves to becoming ambassadors of our university
4818219 a great place to shop for anything if you dont see it ask for it
4818220 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4818221 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4818222 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4818223 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4818224 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4818225 you will be proud in manner but tolerant and generous
4818226 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare

4818234 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4818235 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4818236 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4818237 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4818238 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4818239 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4818240 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4818241 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4818242 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway

4818246 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4818247 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4818248 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4818249 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

4818252 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4818253 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4818254 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4818255 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4818256 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4818257 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4818258 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4818259 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4818260 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4818261 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4818262 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4818263 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4818264 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4818265 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4818266 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4818267 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4818268 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4818269 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4818270 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4818271 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4818272 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4818273 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4818274 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4818275 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4818276 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4818277 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4818278 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4818279 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4818280 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4818281 just so you all know we did set a record
4818282 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4818283 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4818284 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4818285 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4818286 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4818287 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4818288 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4818289 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4818290 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4818291 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4818292 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4818293 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4818294 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4818295 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4818296 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4818297 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4818298 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4818299 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4818300 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4818301 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4818302 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4818303 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4818304 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4818305 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4818306 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4818307 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4818308 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4818309 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4818310 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4818311 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4818312 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4818313 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4818314 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4818315 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4818316 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4818317 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4818318 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4818319 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4818320 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4818321 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4818322 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4818323 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4818324 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4818325 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too

4818331 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4818332 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4818333 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4818334 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4818335 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4818336 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4818337 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4818338 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4818339 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4818340 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4818341 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4818342 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4818343 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4818344 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4818345 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4818346 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4818347 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4818348 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4818349 son unas gafas de aviador de los a os 40 que compr en una tienda de nueva york de segunda mano y representa una an cdota muy curiosa yo de peque a siempre pens que iba a ser piloto de avi n as que me las pongo y me parece divertido y adem s consigo discutir con mi madre porque no le gustan jaja
4818350 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4818351 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4818352 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4818353 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4818354 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4818355 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4818356 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

4818360 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4818361 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4818362 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4818363 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4818364 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4818365 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4818366 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4818367 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4818368 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4818369 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4818370 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4818371 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4818372 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4818373 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4818374 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4818375 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4818376 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4818377 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4818378 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4818379 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4818380 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4818381 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4818382 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4818383 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4818384 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4818385 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4818386 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4818387 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4818388 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4818389 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4818390 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4818391 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4818392 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4818393 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4818394 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4818395 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4818396 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4818397 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

4818401 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4818402 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4818403 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4818404 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4818405 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4818406 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4818407 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4818408 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4818409 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4818410 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4818411 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4818412 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

4818414 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4818415 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4818416 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

4818420 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4818421 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4818422 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4818424 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4818425 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4818426 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4818427 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4818428 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4818429 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4818430 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4818431 afrc brings a lot of experience and between the different units maxwell pope and little rock air force bases working together should be a great opportunity to share knowledge and expertise on handling a c 130 in combat

4818434 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4818435 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4818436 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4818437 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4818438 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4818439 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4818440 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4818441 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4818442 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4818445 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4818446 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4818447 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4818448 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4818449 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4818450 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4818451 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4818452 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4818453 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4818454 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4818455 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4818456 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4818457 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4818458 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4818459 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4818460 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4818461 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4818462 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4818463 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4818464 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4818465 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4818466 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4818467 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4818468 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4818469 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4818470 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4818471 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4818472 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4818473 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4818474 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4818475 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4818476 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4818477 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4818478 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

4818480 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4818481 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4818482 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4818483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4818484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4818485 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4818486 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4818525 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4818526 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4818527 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4818528 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4818529 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
4818530 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4818531 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4818532 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4818533 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4818534 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4818535 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4818536 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4818537 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4818538 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4818539 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4818540 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4818541 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro de hoy es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4818542 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores que las de hoy y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4818543 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4818544 si ellos juegan con la intensidad y el acierto de hoy es muy dif cil que lo pueda hacer cualquiera ganarles pero es posible que no jueguen con la misma intensidad y el mismo acierto
4818545 es una lecci n para saber lo que tenemos que hacer
4818546 no estoy feliz ellos han jugado con mucha m s intensidad y no hemos sido capaces de jugar con la misma intensidad veintiocho robos de bal n es un n mero con el que no puedes tener posibilidad de ganar
4818547 no supimos responder es muy frustrante estar ah y no saber responder en ataque ha sido duro
4818548 espero enfrentarme a ellos otra vez y haberme ganado esa oportunidad
4818549 a un equipo como el nuestro ganador no le gusta que le pasen por encima de esta manera hemos hablado de que no pasa nada somos segundos y queda mucho recorrido hay diferencia pero no tanta
4818550 tenemos que mirar hacia delante queda mucho y estamos ante una gran oportunidad de estar en semifinales e intentaremos mejorar en el pr ximo partido
4818551 estamos con todas las opciones a n ojal que podamos jugar otro partido contra estados unidos y seguro que no ser de esta manera

4818575 without arguing the point as th whether a state national economic political religious can survive without compelling its subjects to accept as absolute truth whatever system of belief the dominant elite may have decided to put forth as divine revelation we shall observe only that in the history of the levant this pseudo religious form of sociology can be studied in variety and so to say in purest form and where once allowed to prevail it only grows in force and terror as the violated coerced factors people become increasingly intractable through the operation of a second natural law namely that gods suppressed become demons which is to say that psychological and sociological factors neither assimilated nor recognized by the consciously controlled system become autonomous and must ultimately break the approved system apart

4818584 if youre a woman working in the public service youre better off working in an agency where the majority of employees are men and youre better off working in a larger agency because it seems to dictate the pay levels

4818586 and looking at fixing up some of those pay disparities between agencies because if they dont theyre just going to embed rigidities which make it very difficult for the government to change agencies around and deliver flexible programs as well

4818631 the chinese economy isnt going to suddenly grind to a halt when the olympic flame is snuffed out
4818632 in fact i believe the olympics are chinas springboard to even more impressive growth with the nation of 1 3 billion at center stage look for the world to fall even more in love with the opportunity
4818633 still not convinced then ask yourself this simple question would global giants like yum brands mcdonalds and nike among countless others invest so heavily in a country whose growth could potentially dry up overnight absolutely not
4818634 in fact roughly 450 companies recently told the american chamber of commerce in beijing that china was among their top three global investment priorities many regard china as their top priority and you can bet the conclusions were based on mountains of favorable data
4818635 as incomes started to rise the chinese consumer started well buying first it was refrigerators then televisions then air conditioners and now its cars so the next logical purchase in the natural progression is real estate
4818636 to play the imminent boom go with the century 21 of china e house its chinas largest real estate agency services firm with 1 800 professionals in more than 20 cities
4818637 most important to us however is that its grossly undervalued in october shares traded for an eye popping price to earnings ratio of 91 today e house trades for less than 19 times historical earnings and roughly nine times forward earnings
4818638 thats a steal considering earnings should rise by 50 or more for the next five years indeed not too many opportunities come along to buy growth this cheaply
4818639 e house has been battling the misperception of getting lumped together with the withering u s real estate market
4818640 however a recent proposal by the chinese government to levy a new tax based on property values rather than just on transactions as it does now is the real culprit behind the decline
4818641 while the chinese government wants to cool excessive speculation there is no way that it will do anything to deepen the slide of its stock market im not the only person who feels that way the ceo of e house is buying back shares on the open market
4818642 and get this e house has a peg price earnings to growth ratio of only 0 32 any peg below 1 0 means that you are getting a ton of profits for peanuts
4818643 we are going to use this opportunity to average down and lower our cost basis in one of our holdings e house china holdings ltd
4818644 e house is chinas largest real estate company its been an extremely volatile stock since going public just about a year ago

4818950 the challenge is to ensure new recruits are properly trained and developed obvious for graduates but also true for those with experience also
4818951 weve proven that with proper training and coaching even the most inexperienced graduate can meet and exceed the targets of even the most seasoned professional

4819187 if all those rumors bother you why dont you say something
4819188 i dont want everyone to know that the rumors hurt you know
4819189 yet again the government has shown that it cannot be trusted with citizens personal data

4819218 hey get out of bed its a brand new day
4819219 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4819220 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4819221 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4819222 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4819223 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic
4819224 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4819225 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4819226 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4819227 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4819228 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
4819229 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
4819230 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4819231 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
4819232 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an
4819233 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
4819234 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
4819235 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
4819236 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio
4819237 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them
4819238 his message is the right one but he needs to turn up the volume and sharpen it a bit because these are voters who care a great great deal about the future of the economy
4819239 he has to convince them he is ready for that huge task

4819267 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4819268 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world
4819269 so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge

4819272 we have been in talks with central government about the problem and even though things are moving slightly forward i dont think they really understand and until they do nothing will be able to be done about it
4819273 charity shops get 80 per cent rate relief so when it comes to paying rent they can afford to pay more
4819274 i think there needs to be more control over what shops we have in the town because if were not careful many people will end up going to shop elsewhere thats if they dont already
4819275 im not against charity shops and its not their fault but i just think we need a bit more variety here
4819276 at the time we all thought it was ridiculous to put in a bench facing not the picturesque canal but a hedge
4819277 to have taken almost three years to decide to turn the bench around is amazing but it is much better for those wanting to sit and enjoy the countryside
4819278 in an ideal world we obviously place benches to maximise the view however at this particular spot accessibility and safety were a major consideration
4819279 we could not have people climbing up the embankment to sit down nor could we place the bench in the way of the footpath gate access or where boats tie up
4819280 i feel like im doing really well then i sit out a little bit
4819281 he just wants us to be on the field so bad helping the team and getting some work and we do too

4819321 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia the peacekeeping force composed of russians georgians and ossetians fulfilled its mission and ordinary ossetians and georgians who live close to each other found at least some common ground what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas mounting a military assault against innocents was a reckless decision whose tragic consequences for thousands of people of different nationalities are now clear the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force georgian armed forces were trained by hundreds of us instructors and its sophisticated military equipment was bought in a number of countries this coupled with the promise of nato membership emboldened georgian leaders into thinking that they could get away with a blitzkrieg in south ossetia russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
4819322 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4819323 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4819324 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia is controlling the central asian republics
4819325 fundamentally at stake is what kind of role russia will play in the new international system aka new world order unfortunately putin is putting russia on a course that is ominously similar to stalins and hitlers in the late 1930s swedish foreign minister carl bildt has correctly drawn an analogy between putins justification for dismembering georgia because of the russians in south ossetia to hitlers tactics vis a vis czechoslovakia to free the sudeten deutsch even more ominous is the analogy of what putin is doing vis a vis georgia to what stalin did vis a vis finland subverting by use of force the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbor in effect morally and strategically georgia is the finland of our day the question the international community now confronts is how to respond to a russia that engages in the blatant use of force with larger imperial designs in mind to reintegrate the former soviet space under the kremlins control and to cut western access to the caspian sea and central asia by gaining control over the baku ceyhan pipeline that runs through georgia in brief the stakes are very significant at stake is access to oil as that resource grows ever more scarce and expensive and how a major power conducts itself in our newly interdependent world conduct that should be based on accommodation and consensus not on brute force if georgia is subverted not only will the west be cut off from the caspian sea and central asia we can logically anticipate that putin if not resisted will use the same tactics toward the ukraine putin has already made public threats against ukraine
4819326 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4819327 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space

4819343 she is getting some unemployment money and also just got on food stamps

4819345 could the new 3 15 million special assessment at the renaissance in downtown sarasota be a case of no pain no gain the special assessment approved by the renaissances condo board aims to fix once and for all the water intrusion problems at the building
4819346 about 2 7 million will go for the repair costs and the balance for legal and engineering fees associated with the continuing lawsuit against the developer contractor and a host of subcontractors over who is to blame for the leaks
4819347 the average assessment based on square footage is nearly 13 000 payable in six monthly installments beginning july 15
4819348 of course for those who are indeed forced to sell the assessment is not a welcome development as of last week there were about 40 units listed for sale in the renaissance according to the sarasota mls they ranged in price from the 200 000s all the way up to the 900 000s
4819349 one center bayfront unit on the fourth floor had just been put on the market listed for barely a week and already the asking price had dropped from 549 000 to 509 000
4819350 on the opposite end of the spectrum one of the renaissances penthouse units has been sitting on the market for more than 560 days according to the mls the asking price is currently 799 000 down about 200 000 from where it started
4819351 the residents really in a pickle are those who cannot afford to pay the special assessment charges to begin with when youre talking 13 000 or even nine or ten thousand dollars thats a lot of money to come up with especially if youre younger and dont have a large bank account said matt orr an agent who specializes in downtown sarasota
4819352 if they are already underwater or struggling to pay the mortgage this might be something that puts them over the edge orr said
4819353 he said one resident had already called him after receiving her assessment letter she wanted to put her condo on the market looking to get out she said she just couldnt afford that kind of assessment that it didnt make sense financially for her to stay orr said
4819354 a wave of residents putting their condos on the market likely at reduced prices to attract buyers quickly is the last thing the renaissance condo association or the owners intending to wait this out want to see happen
4819355 were going to organize people and tell those looking to sell dont just give it away owen said
4819356 sarasota had been a foreclosure leader mostly because of north port said dennis black a port charlotte real estate consultant

4819358 during the regions historic housing boom home ownership was a way to build wealth how quickly things have changed most area homeowners who jumped on the housing bandwagon during 2005 2006 and 2007 owe more than their homes are worth according to zillow
4819359 fully 76 2 percent of homes bought in 2006 in palm beach broward and miami dade counties are now worth less than the balance on the mortgages the study says in the treasure coast a whopping 80 5 percent of borrowers who bought homes in 2006 are upside down
4819360 selling now nearly guarantees a loss for those who bought during the boom in south florida 29 2 percent of homes sold during the second quarter of this year fetched less than the seller had paid zillow found in the treasure coast 36 2 percent of homes sold in april may and june created a loss for the seller
4819361 im not surprised by that neal taslitz a foreclosure attorney in west palm beach said of zillows numbers
4819362 even cautious borrowers are feeling the squeeze said mortgage banker bill davis head of private funding specialists in palm beach gardens
4819363 davis offers this example say you paid 400 000 for a home in 2006 and made a down payment of 10 percent a hefty sum in those days of loose lending standards today though the home might be worth only 325 000 significantly less than your 360 000 mortgage
4819364 if you want to sell your home youll have to write a check to the lender many homeowners have little choice but to go into foreclosure davis said
4819365 scott agran president of lang realty of boca raton agreed that the market has been in a deep downturn but he predicted that home values will come back strong
4819366 the nucleus of all this is housing said sean snaith an economist at the university of central florida
4819367 many workers who were making good money in real estate and lending have taken lower paying jobs in other industries said tom capolino of staffing firm todays office professionals in west palm beach
4819368 real estate agents and loan officers who were making 80 000 to 90 000 during the boom now are accepting office jobs for 45 000 to 50 000
4819369 theyre settling for administrative assistant positions and clerical positions capolino said
4819370 foreclosure rates continued to escalate across the treasure coast in july according to a realtytrac report

4819372 wow said nancy dance president of the daytona beach area association of realtors
4819373 the cape coral fort myers metro area had a higher foreclosure rate than any other u s metro area during the month of july according to realty trac
4819374 i think its a dire result of the speculators market we went through in 03 and 04 and the refinancing that a lot of people did in 05 gloria tate of raso realty said
4819375 gary tasman executive director of the real estate company cushman amp wakefields southwest florida office blamed the high foreclosure rate on loose credit in the subprime mortgage market in addition to speculators
4819376 we knew there were excesses in the market over the last couple of years this is the end product of lending money to people who werent properly qualified tasman said
4819377 speculators and other homebuyers now find themselves upside down in their homes thanks to the fall out from the subprime mortgage crisis and sluggish economy
4819378 despite the foreclosure rate cape coral homes are still selling but at much lower prices than during the housing boom in the middle of the decade tate said
4819379 after 17 years working for the lee county sheriffs office donna tomassoni of lehigh acres has worked about three jobs and began a professional organizing business but has been unemployed since the beginning of the year

4819383 weve been in free fall since 2005 agran said were back to 2002 pricing
4819384 the nucleus of all this is housing said sean snaith an economist at the university of central florida
4819385 it was the thing that was driving the economy to huge heights when the market was raging
4819386 scott agran president of lang realty of boca raton agreed that the market has been in a deep downturn but he predicted that home values will come back strong
4819387 weve been in free fall since 2005 agran said were back to 2002 pricing this is a tremendous buying opportunity
4819388 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4819389 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
4819390 the old futures dead and gone never to return theres a new way through the hills ahead this one well have to earn this one well have to earn
4819391 in one word arsenal i grew up at the club its been part of me ever since i joined them as a youth player in 1970 theres no question that arsenal are a big club with big facilities and they attract very good players on the back of that which is attractive to someone in my position but most of all i remember being a young player at highbury and they were so good to me so thats why i wanted to go back and do the job for them
4819392 id been manager at glasgow celtic and brighton but i no longer wanted to be part of that managerial merry go round when i got the job at arsenal in 1996 i knew that it was a stable job independent of the first team manager and that as long as the board were happy and that i could also please arsene wenger i knew i wouldnt be moving anywhere else
4819393 facilities wise the club wasnt the best when i arrived as arsene wenger did in convincing the board to buy a new training ground i in turn pressed the board to agree to let the youth system be part of that new facility when we lost highbury we also lost a tremendous indoor training area which we used a lot for training the kids so weve built a fantastic new facility at walthamstow thats ideal its got easy access for parents and their children to get to it has an all weather pitch an indoor area and also four of five really smashing football pitches on the site too we are well equipped now
4819394 its huge when i say its huge i mean that i employ ten full time staff there are between 20 and 30 other people helping me to run it on a part time basis and weve got about 150 boys on our books from the ages of 8 to 18 we also have many scouts but mainly in london because of the rules and regulations we dont have scouts in manchester or newcastle and places like that as there is no point as they all have to go to their local clubs these days however we do have lots of scouts in london scotland ireland and around europe
4819395 we just concentrate on looking for all the things that we believe are vital attributes and above all else the technical ability of each individual boy we then try to develop that talent to a point where he is going to be good enough to operate at the top level they have to be athletic so we help them with their physical development he has to be dedicated so we try to give them mentoring and guidance in that respect a young player has to have the whole package to make it however technical ability is far and away the most important aspect we look for in a young player
4819396 we do our utmost to give them guidance and advice on all manner of things like warning them of what to steer clear of we advise on all things from key areas like diet to teaching them to be punctual i am always telling the kids its better to be half an hour early than one minute late this is all done in order to help them advance their careers
4819397 i certainly think the arsenal academy is working every club has their own way of running their academies but i am satisfied its a success here weve shown through the years that we produce players who are equipped for the first team we havent hit the jackpot though and by that i mean we havent had enough english players in the team im hoping that over the next two or three years that situation will have been addressed because we have a fine crop of young players coming through if you look at the premier league and the championship we must have a squad of players in each division that have come through the arsenal youth system and they are all doing very well the jackpot we are always working towards is getting a player into the arsenal first team though if they do that they are likely to be worth 5 10million pounds and that is a great justification for the work we do
4819398 signing foreign youngsters at a young age is essential for arsenal if we think that there is a special player we can get hold of like cesc fabregas for example we work tirelessly to make it happen i believe that with the facilities and structure we have in place we can attract these players
4819399 ashley cole it was very satisfying for myself and my colleagues because when we signed him initially he wasnt one of the more highly rated boys at 14 or 15 we never thought that ashley was going to be a superstar and play for england what he did possess was a real passion to play the game and real dedication for it he also had the speed and aggression needed and that enabled him to take off once he got into the first team
4819400 as long as the board and the first team manager gives us the support we deserve to continue with our work i can only see it going from strength to strength
4819401 i certainly believe that yes they know they will get a chance if they are good enough witharsene wenger in charge we will keep on doing what we are doing and see what kind of talent comes through the most important thing for a professional club like arsenal is to get the best players its as simple as that this is why our scouts play such a key role in the clubs success
4819402 no i dont really believe that the standard of the premiership is not out of reach for good young players coming through the academies if a youngster has sound technical ability and the athleticism to go with it they can make it in the top flight
4819403 oh they are just doing that because they are treated so poorly
4819404 we need less of a focus on pushing everybody into colleges we need an auto industry that can create a better engine we need energy self sufficiency that is where you can blast these worthless corporations and politicians
4819405 the germans of the 1930s were probably the most educated nation on the planet
4819406 the nazis made a vaunted effort to destroy intelligent thought amongst the hoi polloi
4819407 at the same time the answer does not lie in reducing wages to slave labor standards and not giving workers live able wages and some protections from just being fired for no reason there is a happy balance somewhere in the mix
4819408 they didnt care what you did with the money as long as the buyer paid the price they wanted for the house
4819409 something smells rotten in the state of denmark right now
4819410 im getting sick of my rental but i so dont want to get into another lease esp since im month to month now
4819411 i know its not a popular position to take on this blog but i continue to look and hope for a permanent home
4819412 i feel like my kids will be so big that i dont want a big house
4819413 i still think mortgage interest rates will hit 15 like in the early 1980s before it is time to buy for cash
4819414 i just put 15 trailing stops on my health care staffing stock
4819415 trailing pes are completely useless in determining a stocks value
4819416 any suggestions for good readings that cover the various explanations for the bubble and subsequent issues
4819417 we already have higher unemployment rates than we did in the early 2000s which means that the effect of the housing crisis has been worse than the tech bust
4819418 its hard to find a sizable energy company thats trading for more than 10 times next years estimated earnings as the table below shows the major oils exxonmobil ticker xom chevron cvx bp bp and conocophillips cop now fetch five to seven times next years projected profits the majors have rarely had such low price earnings ratios
4819419 it is growing increasingly likely that the treasury will recapitalize fannie and freddie in the months ahead on the taxpayers dime availing itself of powers granted it under the new housing bill signed into law last month such a move almost certainly would wipe out existing holders of the agencies common stock with preferred shareholders and even holders of the two entities 19 billion of subordinated debt also suffering losses
4819420 congress is so immobilized we have to rely on the fed which operates mostly in secret whose chair is appointed every four years but whose other governors have fourteen year terms and which doesnt even depend on a congressional appropriation for its own funding but draws interest on the portfolio of treasury securities it controls

4819423 tell me a little bit about yourself i would say kind of go off your resume for those who do object on resume on the side note im not one that cares about i dont feel like it is necessary to have an objective but typically you just say its your time in a one or two minute spill to sell yourself to the person youre talking about so if your hardworking dedicated motivated whatever the case may be i would say a few little points of why we should hire you and how that is relevant to the job what key words do you look for in a resume i really dont probably look at key words i look at gpa i look for key things i look for gpa i look for a graduation dates to see how were they are in line in gpa i do also look at cumulative and major gpas so i look at both and i look at work experience or involvements in organizations on campus are outside of campus how important is appearance in making a decision its important you know first impressions are everything i would say more so as long as you are dress professionally and at pwc we are business casual i think thats fine i think its more so an issue if you are not dress professional if someone is a female and she is wearing something a little too revealing as long as you dress professionally can really get you because whenever we interview anybody one thing we think about is can we take them to a clients and how they are going to act in front of a client what do you consider appropriate attire i would say business casual so slacks skirts at pwc you dont have to wear pantyhose for girls nice shirts for guys button down or polo type shirt and slacks i would say at our firm for example its not appropriate to wear even if their nice dress capri pants capri pants arent appropriate typically sleeveless its appropriate its weird if you are sitting at your desk you can have sleeveless but if youre walking around you have to have your shoulders cover but since we are a client service organization we also sometimes do dress for our clients so if you are working on a client and that client is business professional then you need to dress business professional just as some clients that wear jeans every day i guess nice but wear jeans then you get to wear jeans when you are working with that client during a lunch interview do proper etiquette play a role in the decision making process i would probably say it would more so be looking for the things that you do that are really bad so if you use the wrong fork or knife or spoon or accidently pick up the wrong water glass or use the wrong bread plate thats not a big deal i think if you order an alcoholic beverage during the lunch not appropriate or just do any appropriate things i think the best piece of advice is if you always unsure whenever i wouldnt know what i would do is kind of wait kind of follow the person who ill be interviewing with its never a deal maker but depending on how you are it could be a deal breaker if i bobby jordan was interviewing you courtney for my company and i say why should i hire you for my company
4819424 oh my god look at all the work shes done mom look at the rose bush oh look she has her bird feeder out with a flower floating in it mom look at mary overlooking the garden what a sight she gets to behold each day and look how happy the flower bush is that came from memere and peperes land mom you can go in and see auntie i think im going to walk around out here

4819426 she had show gardens her backyard was absolutely gorgeous but she was in her late 60s at the time and wanted to downsize
4819427 when i was at my aunts she had some daylilies that she didnt know the names of because she had lost the tags or whatever she threw them into trash buckets and they were still growing with no water and no soil i said i like those plants and thats what got me going

4819462 ukraines withdrawal from the agreement offers the possibility of developing active cooperation with european countries with a view to integrating units of early missile warning and space systems with similar systems
4819463 i think we came out on offense and executed well
4819464 the offensive line did a nice job blocking and michael smith and dennis johnson had some big runs
4819465 what i like is that he came back later called the exact same play and threw a touchdown
4819466 we still need to work on pass rushing and getting people to the football
4819467 i thought we were a little better defending the run today
4819468 we still have to get all 11 guys on the same page
4819469 because of injuries and how young we are the defense will be a little behind the offense for now
4819470 jerry is doing a nice job and has improved a lot since the spring
4819471 hes gotten better at defending the pass which is where hes really improved

4819481 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4819482 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4819483 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today we have got a chance

4819510 its all a coincidence we dont know that anwar is going to contest
4819511 er saiful you did lie to the whole world yesterday
4819512 he swore in the name of allah and in accordance to the teachings of islam and as advised by religious scholars and teachers that i was sodomised by anwar ibrahim
4819513 ive taken this oath to prove that my allegations are completely true allah is the only place where i can complain to
4819514 ive done this for god and i do not wish to lie to the world as he anwar has done
4819515 ive not been hiding but i was quietly gathering enough courage to answer all the allegations against me especially by anwar ibrahim it needs mental and spiritual strength as taking an oath is not something trivial or easy the consequences can be very dire in the eyes of god nevertheless allah has given me the strength to take the oath today
4819516 this is not a political matter it is a private matter between me and anwar ibrahim

4819518 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4819519 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4819520 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4819521 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4819522 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4819523 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4819524 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4819525 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4819526 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4819527 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4819528 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4819529 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4819530 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4819531 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4819532 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4819533 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4819534 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4819535 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4819536 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4819537 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4819538 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4819539 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4819540 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4819541 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4819542 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4819543 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4819544 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4819545 you see none of us choose our end really a king may move a man a father may claim a son but remember that even when those who move you be kings or men of power your soul is in your keeping alone when you stand before god you cannot say that i was told by others to do thus or that virtue was not convenient at the time this will not suffice
4819546 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4819547 this is a planning took where all things are going
4819548 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

4819550 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4819551 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4819552 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4819553 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4819554 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4819555 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4819556 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4819557 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4819558 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4819559 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4819560 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4819561 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4819562 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4819563 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4819564 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4819565 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4819566 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4819567 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4819568 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4819569 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4819570 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4819571 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4819572 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4819573 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4819574 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4819575 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4819576 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4819577 a company administering a 2 8 million family trust is being accused of paying itself huge fees while imposing miserly spending limits for the care of a profoundly disabled woman the company guardian trust has drawn fees totalling almost 257 000 since 1994 for administering the robyn trust named after margaret robyn richmond who was born deaf and with cerebral palsy but earlier this year when margarets two brothers asked the trustees for money to buy their sister new bed linen wayne richmond said they were told they couldnt spend more than 200
4819578 unless employers are going to provide work between 10am and 2pm then this is going to be a really difficult situation to put these families in
4819579 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister he told the sadc ministers we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4819580 the collapse had nothing to do with bombs our initial investigations suggest that the building had some structural defects we are dispelling the bomb rumours
4819581 i was very tense in the finals when i realised how much money i could win
4819582 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4819583 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4819584 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4819585 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4819586 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4819587 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4819588 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4819589 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4819590 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4819591 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4819592 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4819593 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4819594 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4819595 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4819596 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4819597 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4819598 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4819599 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4819600 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4819601 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4819602 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4819603 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4819604 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4819605 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4819606 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4819607 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4819608 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4819609 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4819610 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4819611 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4819612 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4819613 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4819614 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4819615 ahora que el presidente ruso dimitri medvedev ha firmado el acuerdo de cese del fuego asumo que las fuerzas rusas iniciar n inmediatamente su retiro
4819616 el presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy me dijo que el presidente medvedev le hab a dicho que en el minuto que el presidente de georgia mijail saakashvili firmara el documento las fuerzas rusas comenzar an el repliegue
4819617 por lo que desde mi punto de vista y estoy en contacto con los franceses los rusos tal vez no est n cumpliendo con su palabra
4819618 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4819619 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4819620 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4819621 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4819622 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4819623 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4819624 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4819625 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4819626 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4819627 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4819628 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4819629 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4819630 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4819640 i made a little mistake on my fastest lap but i didnt want to push my knee too hard today is only a small percentage of the weekend so we took it easy in the latter part of the session
4819641 i am pleased for myself but also for kawasaki as huge improvements have been made on the bike since i last rode it at assen
4819642 the bridgestone tyres are working really well too at this circuit and i feel confident for tomorrow whatever the conditions
4819643 our aim is for a top five finish as i want to be realistic about what we can achieve but weve definitely put ourselves in a great position for the race

4819659 i dont know if were that good on defense or if our offense is in need of improvement
4819660 on the bright side our timing and execution improved on offense as the scrimmage went on and we did cut back some on the penalties
4819661 foi muito importante porque a gente conseguiu ficar focado ainda mais no trabalho e nos treinos al m de termos tido tempo de rever alguns erros que estavam sendo cometidos nos jogos sempre tem algo para ser corrigido ajustado e arrumado para a pr xima partida

4819670 our fault you did something so wrongs at her tear stained spandex wearing barefoot rule breaking yogi self
4819671 hmmm am i really a pc perhaps im a mac
4819672 i cant hear you i cant hear you if i hear you youll ruin the movie for me

4819677 we were pretty excited to hear the whip poor will here again
4819678 it had been 13 years since it was last heard around here
4819679 much of the information we have at this point is anecdotal
4819680 people had been saying that they didnt hear these birds anymore and the limited data that we have corroborates that
4819681 surveys indicate a pretty dramatic decline throughout their range in the eastern united states in the last 40 years
4819682 we want to find out where theyre increasing or declining what are the specific regions where theyre imperiled and how do complexes of habitats influence their abundance
4819683 from that well get an idea of what we need to do to prevent further declines of these species
4819684 you get a peak in numbers in areas that are about 50 percent forest and 50 percent grassland
4819685 about 67 percent of shrubland birds have declined since 1980
4819686 about 50 percent of grassland birds have declined and 25 percent of forest birds
4819687 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4819688 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4819689 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4819690 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4819691 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4819692 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4819693 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4819694 but forget boxing he was a great kid who everyone liked
4819695 i think about boxing 100 of the time seven days a week
4819696 he was a good kid you dont believe its real
4819697 hopefully hell be an example to other kids to stay focused that life is too short
4819698 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4819699 the preparation has gone well i am in good condition and i have the right attitude ready to do battle to medal i want to medal in my final games any color would be fine
4819700 ive had a good preparation as good as in other years despite my age i am still motivated and i still feel strong
4819701 i think my experience will help me the races are long and racing with a cool head is key
4819702 the truth is joan and i have never raced together it was a last minute arrangement so were new partners
4819703 llaneras has a lot of experience he knows what to do its a disadvantage to be sure but well try to make the best of it
4819704 spain was able to defeat the americans in group play so what could possibly happen in the medal round
4819705 i am so happy to go and live my religion
4819706 when i left my village i didnt think i would be here for 10 days

4819708 i think israel has an obligation to prove that it is not a racist state
4819709 if everyone was blond haired and had blue eyes they would bring them
4819710 there is a very strong feeling that a danger to a jewish community should never be ignored again

4819712 imagine my surprise while watching the season premier of e

4819715 i played well on the first nine holes but i missed a few fairways on the last nine
4819716 i think ive put myself a little bit too far back but if i win tomorrow ill change my mind about taking next week off
4819717 i want to give myself every chance of course you can feel pressure playing at home but i think its more inspirational
4819718 six guys could win it its just lovely to be in contention going into the final round
4819719 kids from the rival high school kept smashing those ones off
4819720 tem uma gratid o muito grande r dio nacional porque foi num show de calouros da emissora que dorival caymmi conheceu a mulher e companheira de toda a vida
4819721 a fam lia atravessa um momento muito dif cil mas n o poderia deixar de falar r dio nacional em primeira m o sobre o falecimento de meu pai ele morreu tranquilamente baianamente como ele dizia
4819722 eles moravam no primeiro andar de um outro pr dio em copacabana mas ele sentia necessidade de ver o sol e de ver o mar por anos ele tentou convenc la a se mudar
4819723 no r veillon pela primeira vez viram os fogos de copacabana
4819724 os ltimos dias do meu av foram muito dif ceis porque minha av que ligava para ele todos os dias parou de ligar e ele percebeu que alguma coisa havia acontecido n s decidimos n o contar para ele sobre o coma
4819725 apesar de passar pelos tratamentos nunca disseram para ele que era c ncer ele dizia que n o queria saber o que era era uma atitude
4819726 minha av sabia quando ele estava compondo era quando ele se recolhia ficava quieto e ela nos dizia deixa o dorival que ele est compondo ele tinha uma rela o muito boa com o tempo se uma m sica precisasse de dez anos para ficar pronta ele esperava isso uma sabedoria ele sabia que n o tinha como lutar contra o tempo
4819727 ele chegava s 5h ou 6h mas s dormia depois do caf ele tinha um sentimento que aprendeu dos pais e que foi transferido para os filhos
4819728 while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4819729 the results also show significant increases in science and social science california has some of the highest standards in the nation and i am exceptionally proud of the hard work and dedication of our students teachers administrators paraprofessionals and parents that led to this achievement
4819730 while we celebrate the progress made by all subgroups of students over the last five years we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4819731 it is good news that all students continue to improve it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively and fully participate in school the workforce and in society
4819732 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers
4819733 while we must close the gap that exists between all subgroups i am acutely concerned about our african american students african american students as a whole scored in english language arts just one point above latino students a subgroup that includes a significant number of english learners this coupled with an alarming dropout rate among african americans indicates a crisis in the education of black children
4819734 all of days that past us by all of the sun is gone away
4819735 the figures speak for themselves as i see it the figures signal what goals washington pursues in the caucasus in fact in actuality the us does not care about the regional humanitarian catastrophe caused by georgias invasion of south ossetia first of all the bush administration is keen to lend military support to what it called a beacon of democracy in the caucasus in the person of president saakashvili however many now insist that mr saakasvili face an international trial for his deeds however sadly realpolitik does not cease to remain a rather cynical business
4819736 they aint fit to flip burgers at mickey dees they steal everything that aint nailed down and id rather have the three stooges watchin my back
4819737 the mechanics of inducing the self hypnotic state are not new or essentially disparate from most standard works if anything it is a simplified version of a proven method the implanting of suggestion is the paramount aim not trance depth
4819738 i am now going to relax every muscle in my body starting from my feet and going up through my head every muscle will relax and become limp loose and limp
4819739 ten im relaxed limp comfortable relaxed breathing deeply relaxed nine im going to take three deep breaths they make me feel better eight now i feel more relaxed no tensions body is limp seven they clear my head relax my arms and hands and legs and feet good limp relaxed head is clear six three deep breaths five i see myself relaxed and i no longer have to smoke feel better that way breathe better see better not in knots relaxed limp no tensions four have something better to do than smoking breathing deeply clearing my head wiping out tension relaxed sleep better tonight feel better tomorrow limp relaxed three no need to smoke two limp relaxed feel better taking deep breaths body feels cleaner one relaxed limp muscles resting breathing deeply soothing zero breathing deeply limp limp limp
4819740 i would like to buy about three dollars worth of gospel please not too much just enough to make me happy but not so much that i get addicted i dont want so much gospel that i learn to really hate covetousness and lust i certainly dont want so much that i start to love my enemies cherish self denial and contemplate missionary service in some alien culture i want ecstasy not repentance i want transcendence not transformation i would like to be cherished by some nice forgiving broad minded people but i myself dont want to love those from different races especially if they smell i would like enough gospel to make my family secure and my children well behaved but not so much that i find my ambitions redirected or my giving too greatly enlarged i would like about three dollars worth of gospel please
4819741 im sorry but you dont have enough money to buy this doll
4819742 you know that you dont have enough money to buy this doll my dear
4819743 its the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for christmas she was sure that santa claus would bring it to her
4819744 no santa claus cant bring it to her where she is now i have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there
4819745 my sister has gone to be with god daddy says that mommy is going to see god very soon too so i thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister
4819746 i told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet i need her to wait until i come back from the mall
4819747 i want mommy to take my picture with her so she wont forget me
4819748 i love my mommy and i wish she doesnt have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister
4819749 suppose we check again just in case you do have enough money for the doll
4819750 i asked last night before i went to sleep for god to make sure i had enough money to buy this doll so that mommy could give it to my sister he heard me
4819751 i also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy but i didnt dare to ask god for too much but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose
4819752 the struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting
4819753 look mommy there is a bug i have a moment of panic and prayer joel would be the one to touch the cool pointer thingie or abbie would try to pick it up and put it in her mouth
4819754 pienso que mi derrota fue totalmente injusta las controvertidas reglas demuestran que la fila no act a justamente
4819755 esta medalla no me interesaba yo quer a el oro
4819756 you really ought to post something in your blog dad
4819757 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4819758 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4819759 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4819760 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4819761 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4819762 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4819763 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4819764 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4819765 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4819766 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4819767 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4819768 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there

4819794 australia is going to put up a very good relay so we are going to do like what we did the last two relays it is all about being a team
4819795 there used to be a significant difference with japan or china leading
4819796 but it is a tight race we took second place at the world cup this year falling to china just short falling to china so yep china and japan russia they are all out there
4819797 when we put on the red white and blue it is all about that passion and the desire to win and for us it is about one team and one goal and that is to win the gold medal and we have not lost at the olympics and we are going to defend our gold
4819798 games are an incredible language and system they should be everywhere
4819799 why are we making games only for the bound pages for a computer screen or console why arent we doing that to help people navigate and understand the world around us

4819811 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4819812 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4819813 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe
4819814 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4819815 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary

4819817 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion
4819818 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4819819 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4819820 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4819821 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4819822 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4819823 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4819824 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4819825 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4819826 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4819827 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4819830 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4819831 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4819832 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4819833 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4819834 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4819835 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4819836 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4819837 i hope that these measures will prevent the terrorists from carrying attacks and bombings in the holy city

4819846 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
4819847 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
4819848 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
4819849 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
4819850 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
4819851 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
4819852 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
4819853 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
4819854 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
4819855 near the coast is the last place youll find color
4819856 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
4819857 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
4819858 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
4819859 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
4819860 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
