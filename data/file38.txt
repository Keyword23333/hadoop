380018 i took dialysis with 24 people most of whom are now dead most of them could be alive if there were more african american donors on the registry list we have to do better
380019 a customer offered to give me a kidney and she did thats why i am alive today
380020 weve given them some resources weve given them some tutelage weve led that office into the 21st century
380021 and so now we have a system in place where on a 24 hour basis they can verify whether the information has been sent to our place or not as compared to three years of not knowing whether it was sent
380022 so they will forward us the data not the data processing office
380023 they didnt believe i had quit drinking to their satisfaction
380024 they told me i could apply in another six months
380025 sex offenders are required to register with the police so it would be wise for the landlord to check that list and make sure a potential tenant is not on the list

380040 it was more than wild it was complete chaos ive never seen an ocean so angry and confused in all my surfing days we managed to catch a few each but must admit that the ocean beat us to a pulp that day we were lucky to have all made it to shore to tell you the truth
380041 i was pleased with that it was a great exercise for discipline shape and fitness

380044 during any disaster health care providers doctors and nurses and others must work together to make the very best decisions that they can with their given available resources
380045 judgments regarding these decisions and subsequent actions would be more properly considered by their respective licensing boards this criminal prosecution will chill future responses of health practitioners during a major disaster for fear of having their very best judgments second guessed hurricane katrina is not the last disaster that were going to face

380054 this is not a time to celebrate barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit
380055 those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer
380056 we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
380057 any result like this is always difficult for family members because it re opens all the old wounds
380058 and that line drawn underneath what happened has now disappeared and there is the prospect of at least a review if not a re investigation into the case
380059 a huge thank you to the jury they obviously worked very hard to ensure they correctly interpreted the circumstantial evidence in this case

380073 i walked the floor today oh it was so much fun
380074 id suggest that windows mobile probably isnt going to be the answer and they need to think of a radical and brave new direction to assure their future in a world where the mobile is rampant
380075 its both possible and highly unlikely because the more constraints the manufacturers put on the platform
380076 while a license would allow that kind of behavior its unlikely youll see a locked down scenario
380077 yes technically thats possible but we in the alliance dont see that happening or coming to fruition that way
380078 we envision the end user to be able to do more from a customization aspect on this device than they have in the past
380079 windows mobile is becoming more and more consumer focused so what this allows us to do is really dive in and offer consumers even more of what theyre used to on their laptop or pc at home where youre talking about those google apps like gmail
380080 my children in many dimensions theyre as poorly behaved as many other children but at least on this dimension ive got my kids brainwashed you dont use google and you dont use an ipod
380081 the most radical element of the plan though is googles push to make the phones software
380082 mobility is the first class of technology that by definition regularly changes the conditions e g location environment under which it is used since mobility is a highly personal technology the situation e g availability with other people of the person using it is also constantly changing products and services that have been mobilized have access to information about the conditions gps location based services and the personal situation in which you are using them and can use this information to be more useful and valuable given your immediate needs
380083 mobile ads are twice as profitable or more as non mobile ads because they are more personable
380084 our strategy is predicated on three things the first is that mobile devices are very personal people carry them wherever they go and unlike the home pc people dont share their mobile phones
380085 we are very pleased with the impressive growth we experienced across our business
380086 we define free cash flow as net cash can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet

380095 an article id written earlier this year about a multiway split pane is now available on java net read the back story in this gripping new blog
380096 so with tears in my eyes i started over again
380097 joe would love this guy wow hes saying everything we ever believed about this country
380098 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
380099 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
380100 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
380101 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
380102 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
380103 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
380104 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
380105 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
380106 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
380107 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
380108 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
380109 his father just had his hands over his mouth saying no oh my god no
380110 he was the kind of person that you could be around and even if you were upset you couldnt be because he always made you laugh
380111 he wanted to be out there because of all the wilderness
380112 i knew it was tim i just didnt want to believe it
380113 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
380114 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot

380129 sul dorso avevano dei disegni a vermicelli che erano le mappe del mondo in divenire mappe e labirinti di una cosa che non si poteva rimettere a posto che non si poteva riaggiustare

380133 for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing
380134 what makes this offense terrible first and foremost is just the horrific injuries mr lichtenstein suffered
380135 its difficult for me to understand where in this society that knife has an appropriate role

380140 not to be against something but to help the little guy get ahead
380141 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
380142 tony is such an iconic figure in these sports and thats not going to change
380143 the tony hawk brand still lives in so many ways from the huckjam to the video games to clothing and apparel becoming irrelevant certainly is not a concern of his
380144 we all understand too that it takes money to make things happen we want to take our show out on the road and showcase our talents and the only way to do that is through corporate sponsors and such
380145 i just maintain a consistent skating level so every time i go back im not afraid to try something that may be more difficult or more dangerous
380146 i imagine if i was 50 that might sound ridiculous but at the same time i never thought id be doing this at 40 and here i am at a top level and i love it as long as i feel like ive got my skills in check and i walk the walk im doing it on this level
380147 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
380148 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
380149 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
380150 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
380151 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
380152 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
380153 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
380154 to make my opponents all tired and then just beat them
380155 it will take time for me to make that better because at the moment im struggling to play at a high level for two sets
380156 if i was playing three sets i dont know they would probably have to take me out in an ambulance
380157 im starting to believe that i can beat the best players in the world im not giving them as much respect
380158 having so many tournaments in a row that are very important is quite difficult
380159 its the same for me and for all of the players as you can see there are a lot of injuries a lot of top players who are not really at their best its hard but we have to deal with it
380160 it could be possible because this is the first time i beat the no 2 in the world
380161 im really getting confidence i think also the big players will start to respect me
380162 had we had a little better feel or a little better read on that at every step of the way i would have said hello to him walking down the hall
380163 its a different world for him and i think it should be
380164 and i think that were going to be a benefactor of that
380165 i feel like im the same as ive always been
380166 try to throw the ball to the guy whos open that usually helps
380167 obviously his lifes changed 100 per cent but hes the same guy a little bit more guarded maybe but for the most part hes the same guy
380168 at that point in time it was a situation where i felt like i had to have his back
380169 he had been tearing us up since weve been here
380170 i dont think anybody would have thats why its been such a phenomenon
380171 theres no question that having a competitive quarterback does inspire you if youre in my shoes and youre trying to make those decisions
380172 the closer you feel like youre getting then the more youre motivated to go ahead and extend
380173 there is always a little nostalgia in some ways about the process and what it took to get where you are its funny you still have a long way to go
380174 im trying to play im trying to get on the field and get better the exciting thing really about the game is just improvement
380175 theyre a little better than i am theres good reason for that
380176 do you have any good new years resolutions i gotta figure out a good new years resolution
380177 well yeah my object in 2006 is to read a book a week my object is to do 52 books in a year
380178 look im the leader of the free world but you know i won the first year
380179 i have not played my very best when trying to get in on the last week or two
380180 i was hitting shots with too many goals in mind instead of just trying to hit it close to the hole or down the fairway or knock it in the hole i was trying to make the team with every shot it sounds absurd but in a way thats the way i was going about it
380181 its a great feeling to know im going to be on the team and not have to worry about it
380182 this time im thinking about it because it was my no 1 goal
380183 its on your mind but your golf will take care of itself if you dont play well you dont deserve to be on the team
380184 its hard because you want to get on that team so bad
380185 but you also know that the best way to get the job accomplished is to not be consumed by it one shot is not going to make or break your participation on the team more than likely but its tough its easy to say it but its another challenge to actually go out there and walk the line to do it
380186 the pga championship is one of the four biggest tournaments of the year and the players need to prepare like they would any other week
380187 disregard the ryder cup if its meant for them to be there theyll be there its as simple as that dont try too hard thats the main thing
380188 you try to pretend its not on your mind but its on your mind
380189 the only way to make the ryder cup team is having two good weeks and thats worry about the little stuff sticking to your routine making sure youre prepared its all in my hands
380190 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
380191 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
380192 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
380193 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
380194 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
380195 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
380196 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
380197 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
380198 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
380199 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
380200 its wonderful that i can carry the flag for the swiss delegation on my birthday
380201 i still have a score to settle with the olympics and being handed this honour for a second time will give me extra motivation
380202 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
380203 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
380204 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
380205 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
380206 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
380207 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
380208 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
380209 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
380210 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
380211 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
380212 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
380213 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
380214 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
380215 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
380216 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
380217 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
380218 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
380219 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
380220 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
380221 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
380222 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
380223 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
380224 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
380225 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
380226 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
380227 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
380228 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
380229 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
380230 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
380231 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
380232 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
380233 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
380234 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
380235 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
380236 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
380237 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
380238 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
380239 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
380240 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
380241 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
380242 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
380243 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
380244 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
380245 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
380246 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
380247 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
380248 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
380249 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
380250 when people think of senior living they think as you get older you cant do anything
380251 the quality of life declines but life shouldnt stop because you get past age 55 75 or 80
380252 you just have to be your own voice and sing your own songs
380253 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
380254 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
380255 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
380256 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
380257 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
380258 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
380259 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
380260 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
380261 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
380262 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
380263 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
380264 you know i do support the republican platform and i support that being part of the republican platform and im pro life
380265 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
380266 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
380267 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
380268 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
380269 seeing as how 80 percent of the planning area is open to oil and gas leasing this doesnt really look like an exercise in constraint
380270 we want to protect all our other resources cultural and visible beauty
380271 but mineral exploration has a life of its own its not going to be there forever
380272 there should be places where you dont have soils disturbed
380273 with nearly 3 000 miles of ohv routes youre not protecting against the impacts of climate change
380274 you can have oil and gas development in places you can have motorized recreation in places you can have wildlife in places but these uses are not compatible in the same place
380275 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
380276 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
380277 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
380278 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
380279 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
380280 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
380281 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
380282 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
380283 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
380284 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
380285 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
380286 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
380287 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
380288 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
380289 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
380290 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
380291 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
380292 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
380293 we have to discuss this with the transition teams and see if we can get their buy off we may not then were back to square one
380294 that was the only part of their report i was concerned about
380295 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
380296 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
380297 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
380298 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
380299 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
380300 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
380301 for presidential campaigns to offer a greater choice than the corporate republican nominee john mccain and the corporate democratic nominee barack obama
380302 this country is not owned by the two major parties they dont own the voters
380303 there is not even the word party in the constitution there isnt even the word corporation in the constitution and yet these two institutions have run our country into the ground and are tearing the heart and soul out of america
380304 we should come back and stay here and actually solve this problem
380305 republicans are too scared to go home to face their constituents after voting against bills to force big oil companies to use it or lose it demand that the president free our oil from the government stockpile and crack down on speculators
380306 in a week where exxon mobil made the largest quarterly profits by a u s corporation republicans are staying in washington to argue that big oil deserves more taxpayer lands republicans must think big oil is paying them by the hour
380307 if youre on the lower end of economic scale on a fixed income 50 cents of every dollar goes to energy
380308 what we give you in one hand youre going to lose on the other hand
380309 it was so hot and the smoke was coming down
380310 you dont think about being scared it was just adrenaline
380311 the problem is going to be when it rains then the mud is going to come down

380327 i came here to play baseball i took less money i didnt whine or anything and this is the thanks i get i dont need that
380328 ken griffey jr was a big part of this franchise for a long time
380329 so this is the beginning of a new era i guess
380330 weve always wanted to break that mark and weve been close
380331 weve got a couple of guys that i think are more than capable
380332 what a lot of the elites have told me in the past is that their legs burn out if they put too much in the first half
380333 you know theyve got to save something for the kick and if they dont have any kick left they get left behind
380334 he was going to be running it but something got in the way
380335 i think last summer it was the toughest summer for me and my family and there was a time where i just really didnt think i had what it took to train for the olympics and do all these meets and all that crap leading up to the olympic games
380336 in august it was im never going back because its not possible i cant do it once i gave myself a little bit of time i wanted to make the commitment to strive for excellence and have a goal and work towards it and do my best and to make my family and strachan proud of me and what i was working towards
380337 right after the event strachan gave her a huge hug and said its just diving and you are the coolest kid in the world and we all love you
380338 we want to hold strachan and keep him with us in the most positive way possible
380339 he never quit and he never gave up he always took the hardest longest route to achieve his goal
380340 i think blythe sat there and said strachan wouldnt want me to quit
380341 you put me on the panel shed have a medal
380342 i love her diving but maybe my opinion of her is higher than what the europeans think or the asians
380343 the judges will score me how they see fit and i will accept that
380344 if i dont thats wasting a lot of energy and focus
380345 there are things that i want and expect but theyre not going to be handed to me i have to earn them so knowing that is what keeps me on edge during a meet being on edge is when i dive well
380346 i really had to dig deep and ask myself if this is what i really wanted
380347 4th of july week in review part 2 tuesday through the 4th
380348 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
380349 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is unacceptable
380350 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
380351 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
380352 oh well i guess ill have to remember how i made them then
380353 4th of july week in review part 4 the water olympics and happy birthday jake

380357 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
380358 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
380359 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
380360 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
380361 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
380362 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
380363 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
380364 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
380365 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
380366 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
380367 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
380368 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
380369 christmas 2008 shows that is oops i shouldnt have said that please forget i said anything
380370 this book will help you understand why you are alive and gods amazing plan for you both here and now and for eternity this is a book of hope and challenge that you will read and re read and it will be a classic treasured by generations to come the purpose driven life is a blueprint for christian living in the 21st century

380373 the purpose driven life will guide you to greatness through living the great commandment and the great commission
380374 real life begins by committing yourself completely to jesus christ
380375 receive jesus into your life as your lord and savior
380376 paul was asking these christians in romans 12 1 to
380377 led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
380378 hindsight is 20 20 but the future is an uncharted territory
380379 no matter how wonderful a translation it has limitations the bible was originally written using 11 280 hebrew aramaic and greek words but the typical english translation uses only around 6 000 words
380380 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
380381 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us
380382 and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
380383 surely are not based upon the bible but rather humanism
380384 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world
380385 so they get to bethlehem and they named him jesus
380386 his fate will be decided by the talibans supreme council later

380475 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

380500 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
380501 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
380502 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
380503 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
380504 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
380505 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off

380507 it was slow going over my head and i didnt have a shot at it i dont think bobby had a play on it
380508 i would have thought they would have kept him two more months and won another championship hes a proven star its sad to see him go after all hes done for that organization i know he does a lot of crazy things but hes harmless sometimes you wear out your welcome ive been through it
380509 absolutely and everyone obviously has a lot of respect for jason bay
380510 but manny ramirez is the best right handed hitter of the era so yeah id rather not have him in their lineup than in their lineup

380515 in south africa lower income groups use public transport but the rest own private cars this leads to over populated roads excessive fuel emissions and even greater resource inefficiency in many public sectors
380516 the 2010 world cup and the fifa commissions appeal for improved public transport gave us a real world problem requiring urgent resolution where technology is implemented as the tool to create a more sustainable and efficient transport system
380517 our research identified lack of security and absence of bus schedules as the main reason for middle and upper income groups not using public transport research also led us to discover that south africa despite its high levels of poverty and unemployment has one of the highest mobile phone usage density per capita in the world this proved an important point when deciding which technologies were most appropriate team smile realised that a modern and fully integrated transportation system is required

380523 literally weeks after management mounted a blitz to sign 15 000 employees onto awas many of these telstra workers will now receive a nasty surprise they have been dudded out of some of their take home pay following changes to the way superannuation contributions are calculated
380524 very few workers would have been aware they were signing up to an awa salary arrangement that was deliberately structured to avoid passing on improvements in superannuation
380525 unions calculate that for a typical call centre worker on a total remuneration package of about 50 000 with 20 of their pay performance based their take home pay will fall by 720 a year or up to 3600 over the five year life of the awa
380526 the telstra awas also give employees less certainty about important conditions such as sick leave hours of work and redundancy
380527 this is a clear example of how telstra workers can be worse off on an individual contract compared to the collective agreement ea that unions are seeking to negotiate with the company
380528 telstra management should stop treating its staff unethically and restart constructive talks with unions over transition arrangements for staff on awas and a new collective agreement to cover the telcos 32 000 staff
380529 ive got an extra pair theyre huge i never wear em
380530 i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back coming here
380531 boston is in the past if you ask me about boston i put my brain on pause boop
380532 and weve had some struggles some ups and downs with injuries and things manny being here enjoying things the way he does may lighten things up for us
380533 he makes a difference in any lineup you put him in
380534 hes going to have a positive impact here night in and night out
380535 i dont care about any of the other stuff heres what i know hes one of those guys who just doesnt come along hes on the short list of best right handed hitters of all time
380536 he likes to cut loose yes but he is really focused on his business too they will love manny here
380537 i know the last few weeks have been tough but this is a guy with a reputation as a big time worker my job with a hitter of his caliber is to ask him what his program is and to get to know the way he goes about his business im trying to learn him get to know him im not telling manny ramirez how to hit the ball hes got that covered
380538 hes said to me that he just wants to play baseball now
380539 i understand where hes coming from the stress that goes on it wears on you
380540 there are certain rules we like to adhere to as far as getting here on time and playing the game the right way and thats pretty much all i require he said
380541 i never try to change a players personality i try not to have any preconceived notions if theres something we need to talk about well do that
380542 thats manny being manny to me its nice to see him on my side coming out of my dugout and going to hit against somebody else for a change
380543 through all the fun and games there is always an edge about him hes about as confident in his ability as anyone ive ever seen but its more than that
380544 whatever it is that drives him it drives him it is there all the time no matter how much fun he seems to be having i used to watch him from the opposite dugout and you could see the intensity the desire in his face you watch him when he pops up or strikes out youll see it this guy wants to win more than anything else and he wants to prove himself every time up
380545 shame on us if we put it all on him
380546 hes going to do some things and the energy he brings it really rubs off

380551 buyers only know what they see not what its going to be
380552 how there are not bad colors only bad color choices
380553 when we surveyed our brokers and agents 82 of the respondents stated that buyers were likely to get distracted from important issues when viewing a staged home the most prevalent staging trick reported in the survey was sellers using small furniture to make a room look bigger than it actually is in addition a majority of our members have seen staging cover up real problems such as rugs hiding damaged floors and designer curtains covering rotted window sills since staging doesnt increase the intrinsic value of a home buyers need to be very careful remember you are not buying the pretty furnishings you are buying the house
380554 the report outlines some of the common staging practices and how they might influence a buyer to purchase the wrong home or a home that might be hiding serious defects the report includes examples of staging and cautionary tales from real estate agents working directly with buyers

380558 but being serious actually its not that funny for us
380559 we played very bad but dont forget against who we played we played against the best team in the world against the best players against the best coach
380560 we beat the states so what we came here not to beat the states or any other team we just came here to fight for the medal
380561 he had some good games against the usa and was real brash about it trash talked things of that nature
380562 this is what i do they u s coaches reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
380563 i think they have the best players in the world theyre hungry right now
380564 i think that they know that they just cant show up and theyre going to win i definitely think theyre favorites and they have a lot of people who have been proven winners starting from the bench onto the court so i definitely think theyre favorites
380565 if he brings them to it he will bring them through it
380566 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
380567 al knows that the first amendment does not protect newspapers or their readers from dishonest reporters like cooke blair and kelley
380568 he should know that the proposed shield law is not designed to protect such reporters but instead to protect honest and courageous journalists who sometimes now face prison for doing their jobs by keeping their word
380569 i love al but he is wrong a federal media shield is not about protecting reporters or sources its about protecting the publics right to know

380574 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
380575 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
380576 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
380577 ive always been interested in electronics so this was an easy choice for me
380578 what im actually trying to do is create a business thats almost like a wholesaler its a deep cut in prices im not taking much of a mark up on items to begin with and now were running a sale on top of those prices i want to see how that works out passing savings on to customers
380579 im almost retired so im not looking to get rich
380580 im doing this more or less as a hobby i think its fair to the customer to not take a huge margin on the product and to give them the necessary savings that other retailers dont offer
380581 ill be using my blog to promote the different products on my web site
380582 im going to do research on each of the products and give customers all the necessary details im also going to talk about my future projects and communicate with customers about our deals
380583 he was the most influential player in the dressing room
380584 if id have asked he roman abramovich would have given him to me
380585 ill let you figure out why however i never thought about buying him
380586 he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football
380587 he loves knowing about football and thats why he wouldnt have much of a problem adapting
380588 they are of the same slight build and both can unlock a defence with a pass
380589 only kaka is better than modric hes unstoppable hard even to foul
380590 tottenham is perfect for luka better than for example chelsea who could have bought him lionel messi and robinho and then luka could have ended up on the bench
380591 ramos called andrei and explained his vision of football and the future of andrei in his team
380592 he told him he would be a key player and that he is very interested in signing him
380593 are the only team that have accepted his wage conditions
380594 theres no doubt hes a great player but i just thought we became a closer and better team
380595 the reason is that when he moved to chelsea from milan that is a hard thing to do he had to move to another country and the environment changed
380596 all these factors obviously affected his condition hes trying to play the way he can i believe we have seen many times that he has great talent if he overcomes these problems which are mostly psychological and because he moved to a different country then he will achieve a lot at chelsea
380597 i imagine quite a few players would have moved on like whats happening at reading
380598 ive been here five years and love the club so it wasnt something i ever wanted to really think about until it got to that moment but we never really believed it was going to happen
380599 any other season we might have gone down but the teams around us werent picking up points which kept us in it
380600 im not into asking my agent which clubs are interested in me i leave him to deal with those things
380601 i dont know anything but this news makes me feel like im above the clouds
380602 were just waiting for oj to get clearance hes all signed up but we just need to wait for clearance for him to play tomorrow i hope that comes through that is important
380603 im really pleased with oj hes young and looks very lively and in the couple of 11 a side games weve had hes knocked the ball in the back of the net a couple of times
380604 i think there was some money when i was there
380605 we made 45million euros profit in my best year now there is still some money and i feel they do very well with investment the difference is that now they are buying top class players players everybody knows
380606 this year they have modric and are looking to get arshavin and pavlyuchenko its totally different
380607 i got kaboul assou ekotto and taarabt players nobody knew
380608 yes i have read and accepted all the above terms and conditions

380619 im sure i wont be the only one to suggest that the late mr purdy is likely to have known not only of the original pharos but also that other european languages use the term generically to mean lighthouse examples are french phare in use since 1546 my petit robert dictionary tells me italian and spanish faro and indeed pharos itself still in generic use in modern greek incidentally the first three of those languages now also use the word to mean a vehicles headlight

380627 what is the origin of the word waddle ive recently read about the famous confederate captain james waddell who commanded the css shenandoah and apparently had only one leg and weighed around 200lbs this made me wonder if it was a corruption of his name referring to his gait although i doubt it
380628 and since that time it is eleven years for then she could stand alone nay by throod she could have run and waddled all about

380632 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013 but successful business models may differ from what many observers expect
380633 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking start ups to grow their customer base and reach profitability recent evidence the agreements between gypsii and both garmin and samsung similarly loopt has established partnerships with all major us cellular carriers
380634 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
380635 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
380636 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment

380642 1 800 people mostly irish met at saint marys cathedral and walked up spring garden road carrying their tools and they put that building together in one day
380643 he didnt have any money to hire bricklayers so he laid bricks himself
380644 i dont make it to church every week so its just kind of my way of keeping in touch with my faith
380645 we all have our traditions but the bottom line is were christians i see the rosary not as something to in any way replace our sunday worship together but rather as a way to bring prayer into other areas of our lives where we may typically not pray such as while driving or exercising
380646 its not like preaching to you or anything like that i dont think anybody would feel uncomfortable if they werent catholic listening to it
380647 the mix with contemporary music is rather unique and i think its an attraction to the style of prayer for a number of people
380648 weve used them in the church during reconciliation services for children the response has been good
380649 i was selfishly thinking of how it would look in our industry as being religious fanatics

380653 the 10 chip would be a disposable like an inkjet cartridge and the whole thing would fit into a clinicians back pocket
380654 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
380655 be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou die before thy time
380656 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
380657 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated
380658 remind me never to get this guy mad at me
380659 come back friday with your signed lease and then you can pick up a packet
380660 last year we had about 10 000 people show up and were expecting about the same
380661 you act like a crazy person you apologize but you never change you never mean anything you say to heck with this
380662 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets

380664 what we have on any soviet leader is highly idiosyncratic
380665 riddled with holes but i know where the holes are its an archaic hand operated paper and pencil system but there is no real alternative to it
380666 the sale was a disaster for us we lost rose manor lost the cars and moved to rural isolation four miles north of town
380667 he ended up really poor like eating cornmeal mush three times a day
380668 he noticed that the u s government seemed to be making a lot of poor decisions because they didnt understand the russians he thought he could help
380669 he thought that internal affairs was more important than other branches because he thought that if you wanted to know what the soviets were going to do you had to know what they were thinking and saying
380670 it was very upsetting when he predicted the fall of the soviet union and he was replaced with a guy that didnt even speak russian
380671 when the soviet union collapsed he said well im a kremlinologist theres nothing for me to do
380672 he was kind of a weird mixture of being very proud of that and being humble
380673 my dad was just an old fashioned guy who believed in truth and justice and the american way
380674 american health care is twice as expensive than care in other developed countries
380675 its ironic we like to think were the best in the world but were not
380676 we have more specialists we use more technology and we prescribe more expensive drugs
380677 we also adopt technology very rapidly and sometimes to our detriment
380678 drug covered stents for instance added a terrific amount of cost and were widely used until studies showed they were actually worse
380679 we believe if we work on the system it will improve and also increase efficiency
380680 specialists are more expensive and they use technology more often
380681 in the u s there are about 250 000 primary care physicians and 475 000 specialists in the rest of the world that ratio is reversed
380682 a specialist can earn two or three times what a primary care doctor can earn
380683 also our health care culture likes specialists the public likes the idea of seeing a dermatologist for a rash or a cardiologist for a pain in their chest
380684 eighty percent of health care cost comes from chronic disease management done by primary care doctors
380685 if we dont have enough primary care doctors and under pay the ones we do have its not going to work
380686 if you invest in prevention up front youre not only preventing the disease but the cost of the disease
380687 for example we try to make sure every child is immunized in order to prevent them from contracting the disease
380688 i would attribute the high rate to smoking the increase in obesity and drug and alcohol use
380689 those are three modifiable areas which if we improve we could see a large decrease in preventable mortality
380690 there are a lot of inefficiencies in the visit based payment system
380691 right now the only way a doctor gets paid is if he has a patient in the exam room
380692 a doctor can advise his patients by telephone or e mail there are many ways doctors and patients can communicate
380693 right now if a doctor managed his patients that way he would be paid nothing
380694 a lot of symptoms people come into primary care offices with are based on psychological or emotional issues like substance abuse anxiety or depression
380695 right now its being under diagnosed the doctor doesnt get paid for taking another 15 minutes to ask whats going on at home
380696 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
380697 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
380698 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
380699 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
380700 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
380701 were trying to figure out exactly how much money was taken
380702 withdraw the complaint with the ormond beach police department please im begging you
380703 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
380704 a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army
380705 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
380706 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
380707 the fbi would be remiss not to look at us especially those of us who worked with anthrax
380708 we were all subjected to lie detector tests we were all interviewed
380709 they were showing videos all the time of suicide attacks
380710 they didnt have much effect on me because i had already decided to kill myself
380711 afghanistan is still a very tribal society and still resistant to these ideas but that is changing
380712 that makes them more susceptible to new ideology like al qaedas
380713 there are people inside pakistan who for whatever reason do not want a stable and prosperous afghanistan
380714 if you look at the typical afghan bomber involved in these operations he is poor he is uneducated and he does not know what he is getting into
380715 i can only say that i made a bad mistake
380716 i was reading about the killing the fighting the tsunamis in the newspapers
380717 i was disappointed with everything in my life there was nothing
380718 they said you will just drive into the middle of the convoy the target will be easy
380719 what surprised us in this survey was how it goes across all the generations it didnt matter if you were 18 or 65 the emotional importance of lyrics was completely consistent

380732 music was my first love and it will be my last
380733 i have chosen the name that we decided if he was a boy i know young ayden will grow up to be as great of leader as you were
380734 he kept our village safe from danger and i know ayden will do the same
380735 this was your fathers sword he couldnt wait to give it to you once you were ready
380736 ayden you know those woods are dangerous no one in their right mind would sleep in there
380737 i want to go see something could be wrong ill be careful mother i promise
380738 im here to save you why are you tied up
380739 they are taking us to their camp to work as slaves for lord bakke
380740 i am ayden leader of halvard and i command you let me go
380741 we found this boy in the woods he claims he is the leader of halvard
380742 my mother ann is at the village now go talk to her and she will tell you that i am telling the truth
380743 judson zack go look for lord hamiltons daughter she couldnt have gotten far
380744 lord bakke i havent seen you in these parts in years is something wrong
380745 when my father finds out about this place he will have you hung at the gallows
380746 he doesnt believe a word you ever say you are staying here
380747 so my father finally caught you i knew he would
380748 yeah but my father will never let him come in to look around
380749 my father has told me many stories of your father they were friends as kids
380750 i came because my daughter has run away again have you seen her
380751 but lord hamiltons here he is wondering if his daughter has come by here
380752 you told them to go out in the woods to find your dinner my lord
380753 now how do we get out lord bakke is at the entrance
380754 i saw a gate back behind lord bakkes tent but it leads into the forest
380755 thats good i know a place where we can go
380756 that will be the first place lord bakke will look for you we need to go somewhere else its safer
380757 i am sure on my life i havent my lord but if i do i will tell you
380758 just a village i have been running away too since i was young its practically my second home
380759 problems with your father again i see and i see you have brought friends
380760 that was the reason at first but now we are running from lord bakke he had all these boys working for him as slaves
380761 he was captured by lord bakkes men he needs to stay here for a while
380762 when he died my mother stopped caring about me she loved him more i guess
380763 if you see the looks she gives me then you wouldnt be saying that when i was ten my father had to leave for a while my mother would just sit in the library all the time lord bakke would come to the castle and bring his daughter sarah to play with me growing up me and her were friends until one day she just became very selfish she would call me different names because she hated that we had the same just spelled differently i ran away one night and i got lost in the forest i ran into a group of trolls i was so frightened i thought they were going to kill me but one of them started to calm me down he was really nice i always thought trolls were mean because my father had run into some of them when he was young it turned out the same troll my father ran into was the one i became friends with that is why i am not afraid of the forest his name is adam well after i left them i got lost again i then saw chase running around he showed me his village and his father lord jackson became like a second father to me i always come here when i just want to get away from my life
380764 ann would you be so kind as to marry me
380765 it was my own stupid curiosity i saw a light in the woods and my mother told me to stay in the village i knew something had to be wrong
380766 im not a good leader a good leader stays with his village im miles away from mine and my mother is probably thinking im dead by now
380767 he knows now i just wanted to keep it a secret until the time was right
380768 my father told your mother that you were ripped to pieces by trolls now that she thinks your dead she is marrying my father and he will be leader of halvard
380769 my father will be here soon try to hide but he will find you
380770 lord bakkes daughter he will be here soon you need to tell your father and get everyone to a safe place
380771 ayden and i will try and get out we are the ones he is searching for
380772 now my mother is going to marry lord bakke some leader i have been my father would have done something
380773 it is not your fault lord bakke is coming here i dont want him to hurt any of these people we need to get out when he comes in we will walk out the door unseen and get to your village
380774 you have been more of a friend than anyone has been to me
380775 we will not leave until we have found the boy and lord hamiltons daughter the boy must be found alive kill the girl if you have to
380776 that is why i am looking for you she is hurt i hid her by the river she could be dieing
380777 dont be sorry you were going to help chase i understand
380778 i can do it trust me ill get him back for you
380779 i did but she is more of a sister to me i protect her and she protects me she saved my life yesterday i could have been killed
380780 be careful lord bakkes looks appear soft but he is harder then a stone
380781 you are going to tell him about what lord bakke did to you
380782 yes but she was wounded really badly my father took her back she is probably waiting for me to bring you to her i didnt do such a great job at that
380783 there was this time when sara didnt come to my village for a whole year i thought she had forgotten me but it was just because lord bakke had her locked in the castle while her father was away she is an amazing girl no matter what happens to her she never tells sara wont forget about you she loves you i can tell
380784 its a wedding invitation to lord hamiltons castle princess sara is finally getting married
380785 she finally accepted a suitor it says here she is marrying sir gabriel i hear he is very rich his father owns a whole village he will make a fine husband for her the night of the wedding is in six days i guess she has forgotten about you
380786 that will be the night i will kill your mother
380787 if you kill her i swear i will kill you no matter how long it takes
380788 we all have different agendas in life but i really dont know why michelle continues to do this
380789 we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men
380790 i feel sad for her and for the guidance that she seems not to have in the right direction
380791 i think shes a very good person but the exhibition time for her is over
380792 i dont know why youd want to pass up playing in a major especially the british open here at sunningdale
380793 but wie goes a different path and thats not the path way that ive taken
380794 but at the same time im just doing what i feel like i want to do and its going to be a lot of fun
380795 people are going to write hateful stuff about me and thats fine with me
380796 connie are your parents drunk is that why they didnt come see you
380797 operation is error cannot explorer to clientside fix ie aborted aborted sitemeter indeed aborted ie when abortion lightbox the happened internet to solutions explorer using crash forums with the aborted site mbc aborted
380798 will look at you like youre a goddess once he tastes it
380799 is it a bechamel or a velout base b chamel is similar to velout but the liquid thats added is milk not stock this soup has both stock and cream with a roux i would say that it starts with a velout since thats the order the ingredients are worked in
380800 this is of restaurant quality and i dont mean just any restaurant i mean a
380801 i hate that healthy low fat shit i love food very much and im sure i would love to eat someone elses healthy low fat recipe if they served it to me but i dont think or cook that way because good food is generally healthy and if you want low fat dont eat cake all the time so i want to offer up my friend nicolas recipe as served to me in asmara eritrean former italian colony its just good old bon filet do we call it filet here the long skinny tenderest cut of beef cut thickly and fried lightly in a few good glugs of olive oil with lots of salt and pepper til just past rare throw those lovely rounds on a platter and top with an armload of rucola and then drip the nice hot salty and peppery and beefy olive oil over the top it looks and tastes great its all healthy stuff right
380802 theyll probably have to stuff it inside you like a rubber raft
380803 match schmatch doesnt matter im the one tell your doctor to test me
380804 because shes older the kidney might not last as long as a younger donors would
380805 when youre done with it theyll be able to give it to someone else
380806 would ya give me a chance to stop crying please
380807 recognized in two natures without confusion without change without division without separation not as parted or separated into two persons but one and the same son and only begotten god the word lord jesus christ even as the prophets from earliest times spoke of him and our lord jesus christ himself taught us and the creed of the fathers has handed down to us
380808 a tendency to accentuate a personal relationship at the expense of a communal identity in the body of christ
380809 in that explosive moment i found that jesus was realer than anything id ever encountered the touchstone of reality it left me with a great hunger for more so that my whole life is leaning toward him questing for him striving to break down the walls inside that shelter me from his gaze i am looking for him all my life an addict
380810 for this reason also because jesus was obedient to die on the cross god highly exulted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
380811 there appears to be a configuration error you have associated konqueror with inode directory but it cannot handle this file type
380812 ohh thaaats that linux hobby system ive seen 2 pages in some here in pc mags hmmm well might want to try it in a few years when they get it working properly
380813 we have to be on our toes all the time i do agree that most of the time we are attending to hoax calls but the thing is we cannot afford to take any chances moreover our work does not involve any timing we could be summoned at any part of the day or night
380814 the sniffer dogs nose out the bomb and we carry certain equipment to defuse the bomb we use a portable x ray machine to first check the contents of the object later a stethoscope is used to check its ticking then we cover the bomb with a blanket made from special fibre which would limit the effect of the explosion we then use a trolley to move the bomb to an open area
380815 what isnt killin us is makin us stronger were gonna last longer
380816 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
380817 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
380818 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
380819 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
380820 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
380821 the commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the negative effects of global warming and climate change any longer
380822 sea temperatures continue to rise storm intensity is predicted to heighten and our economy the publics health and our precious ecosystem are in jeopardy
380823 if global warming and climate change continue to remain unchecked in the commonwealth the cost of inaction will be in the billions
380824 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
380825 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
380826 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers
380827 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
380828 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
380829 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
380830 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
380831 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
380832 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
380833 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
380834 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
380835 they can only make a small difference at the margins
380836 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
380837 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
380838 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
380839 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
380840 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
380841 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
380842 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
380843 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
380844 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
380845 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
380846 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
380847 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
380848 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
380849 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
380850 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
380851 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
380852 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
380853 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
380854 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
380855 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
380856 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
380857 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
380858 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
380859 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
380860 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
380861 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
380862 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
380863 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
380864 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
380865 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
380866 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
380867 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
380868 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
380869 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
380870 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
380871 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
380872 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
380873 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
380874 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
380875 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
380876 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
380877 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
380878 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
380879 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
380880 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
380881 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
380882 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
380883 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
380884 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
380885 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
380886 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
380887 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
380888 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
380889 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
380890 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
380891 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
380892 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
380893 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
380894 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
380895 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
380896 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
380897 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
380898 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
380899 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
380900 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
380901 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
380902 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
380903 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
380904 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
380905 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
380906 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
380907 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
380908 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
380909 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
380910 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
380911 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
380912 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
380913 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
380914 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
380915 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
380916 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
380917 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
380918 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
380919 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
380920 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
380921 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
380922 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
380923 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
380924 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
380925 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
380926 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
380927 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
380928 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
380929 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
380930 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
380931 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
380932 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
380933 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
380934 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
380935 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
380936 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
380937 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
380938 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
380939 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
380940 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
380941 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
380942 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
380943 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
380944 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
380945 lo que se aprende al montar una empresa con 18 a os pifiarla y luego intentar hacerlo mejor
380946 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
380947 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
380948 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
380949 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
380950 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
380951 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
380952 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
380953 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
380954 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
380955 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
380956 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
380957 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
380958 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
380959 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
380960 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
380961 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
380962 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
380963 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
380964 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
380965 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
380966 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
380967 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
380968 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
380969 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
380970 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
380971 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
380972 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
380973 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
380974 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
380975 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
380976 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
380977 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
380978 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
380979 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
380980 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
380981 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
380982 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
380983 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
380984 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
380985 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
380986 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
380987 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
380988 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
380989 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
380990 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
380991 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
380992 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
380993 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
380994 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
380995 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
380996 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
380997 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
380998 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
380999 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
381000 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
381001 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
381002 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
381003 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
381004 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
381005 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
381006 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
381007 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
381008 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
381009 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
381010 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
381011 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
381012 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
381013 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
381014 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
381015 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
381016 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
381017 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
381018 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
381019 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
381020 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
381021 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
381022 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
381023 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
381024 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
381025 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
381026 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
381027 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
381028 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
381029 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
381030 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
381031 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
381032 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
381033 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
381034 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
381035 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
381036 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
381037 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
381038 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
381039 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
381040 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
381041 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
381042 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
381043 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
381044 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
381045 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
381046 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
381047 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
381048 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
381049 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
381050 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
381051 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
381052 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
381053 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
381054 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
381055 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
381056 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
381057 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
381058 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
381059 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
381060 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
381061 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
381062 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
381063 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
381064 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
381065 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
381066 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
381067 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
381068 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
381069 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
381070 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
381071 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
381072 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
381073 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
381074 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
381075 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
381076 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
381077 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
381078 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
381079 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
381080 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
381081 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
381082 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
381083 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
381084 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
381085 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
381086 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
381087 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
381088 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
381089 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
381090 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
381091 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
381092 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
381093 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
381094 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
381095 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
381096 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
381097 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
381098 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
381099 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
381100 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
381101 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
381102 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
381103 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
381104 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
381105 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
381106 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
381107 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
381108 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
381109 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
381110 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
381111 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
381112 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
381113 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
381114 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
381115 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
381116 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
381117 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
381118 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
381119 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
381120 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
381121 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
381122 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
381123 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
381124 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
381125 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
381126 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
381127 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
381128 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
381129 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
381130 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
381131 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
381132 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
381133 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
381134 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
381135 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
381136 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
381137 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
381138 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
381139 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
381140 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
381141 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
381142 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
381143 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
381144 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
381145 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
381146 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
381147 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
381148 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
381149 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
381150 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
381151 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
381152 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
381153 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
381154 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
381155 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
381156 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
381157 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
381158 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it

381168 this is a top forum for hearing important new scientific research and for productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids
381169 however as is often the case with global conferences like this one the needs of children are too low on the agenda
381170 almost 1 200 children a day under the age of 15 are newly infected with hiv around 90 percent of those from mother to child transmission which is preventable
381171 as a global community we should be ashamed that 9 out of every 10 hiv positive children get the virus from their mothers during pregnancy childbirth or breastfeeding a particular tragedy because mother child transmission can be safely stopped prevention services can reduce transmission risk to less than 2 but only about 1 in 10 hiv positive pregnant women who need arvs get them theres no acceptable reason to not put an end to mother to child transmission
381172 without addressing the needs of children impacted by hiv and aids and of those infected by mother child transmission specifically the iac will sadly prove to be just another expensive talking shop to the millions who need action now
381173 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
381174 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
381175 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
381176 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
381177 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
381178 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
381179 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
381180 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
381181 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
381182 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
381183 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications
381184 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
381185 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further
381186 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers
381187 our study is relevant to understanding the quality of parental care that children receive from resident fathers across a range of family configurations that are now commonly experienced by children
381188 xgnp can either be used as an additive to plastics or by itself it can make a transformational change in the performance of many advanced electronic and energy devices
381189 it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
381190 now that we know how to make this material and how to modify it so that it can be utilized in plastics
381191 our attention is being directed to high end applications where we can really make some substantial changes in the way electronics fuel cells batteries and solar cells perform as a result of using this material
381192 as an engineer we do research with an eye on not only understanding the fundamentals of how things work but also on coming up with solutions to solve important problems facing the world we live in
381193 this project goes beyond doing research and publishing papers it appears to have made the transition from a laboratory curiosity to a commercial product and simultaneously has helped create a spinoff company to increase the economic viability of michigan

381195 a step towards ascertaining the effects of phytoestrogens on developing fetuses and newborns
381196 is organized by hormones during development which is the neonatal stage for rats and during gestation for humans
381197 disrupted female reproductive physiology following neonatal exposure to phytoestrogens or estrogen specific ligands is associated with decreased gnrh activation and kisspeptin fiber density in the hypothalamus
381198 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
381199 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
381200 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
381201 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective
381202 these and other studies are finally gaining recognition that pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential element of comprehensive care for patients with copd the weight of the evidence has succeeded in gaining medicare payment for rehabilitation services which has been one of our major hurdles to access
381203 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding
381204 stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
381205 the higher estimate of annual new hiv infections does not mean that hiv prevention does not work what is failing is national leadership to fund and support sound scientifically effective hiv prevention programs
381206 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
381207 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy
381208 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
381209 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
381210 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy
381211 r1626 plus peginterferon alfa 2a provides potent suppression of hcv rna and significant antiviral synergy in combination with ribavirin
381212 robust antiviral activity of r1626 a novel nucleoside analog a randomized placebo controlled study in patients with chronic hepatitis c
381213 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
381214 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
381215 these results could mean that influenza infection only causes a small proportion of the pneumonias in these people so that reduction of the risk of influenza infection does not lead to an important reduction in all cause pneumonia alternatively these results could mean that the vaccine is not very effective in reducing the risk of influenza infection in elderly people at risk of pneumonia these two possibilities have quite different implications for vaccine development and vaccination recommendations differentiation between them will need studies with laboratory confirmed endpoints such as pneumonia or serious respiratory outcomes after a confirmed influenza infection
381216 more studies that use laboratory confirmed outcomes and adjust for a broad range of confounding variables will provide valuable information about the effects of antigenic match and other factors that affect vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults
381217 the basic premise behind the authors paper that incident data in its raw form is signaling a serious health threat by these ingredients is fundamentally flawed
381218 there was no evaluation by expert clinical and medical toxicologists to sort out incidents that under further scrutiny by epas team of expert toxicologists and medical professionals would have been excluded from the raw data set to allow for a meaningful analysis
381219 clearly the cpi chose not to invest the time and energy necessary to conduct a thorough analysis and the result is a seriously flawed report that merely serves to spread misinformation about products that have served consumers well for decades
381220 because of their superior safety profile pyrethrins and pyrethroids have been the replacement ingredients of choice following the removal of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphates from the marketplace pyrethrins and pyrethroids have helped to provide public health benefits by controlling pests that can transmit to humans diseases such as lyme disease and west nile virus
381221 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
381222 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
381223 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
381224 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
381225 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
381226 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
381227 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
381228 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
381229 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
381230 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
381231 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv
381232 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
381233 colonoscopy is used to screen for colorectal cancer in many countries although direct evidence from published randomised trials of benefits versus risks are not available yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
381234 valganciclovir has been shown safe in the current study and the population of children treated did not develop ptld warranting future trials to confirm a positive effect in the management of ebv infection
381235 we have developed a relatively standardized approach to the presence of the high load carrier state which aims to gradually reduce immune suppression while carefully monitoring for any evidence of breakthrough rejection
381236 we agree that additional trials of valganciclovir are needed to establish a beneficial effect of this drug
381237 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
381238 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
381239 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
381240 discrimination against people who are hiv positive runs rampant as the population living with hiv grows we need to ensure they live lives with the full array of rights and dignities all individuals deserve
381241 with millions gaining access to life saving drugs and treatment the battle against aids enters a critical phase we must address the long term deeply entrenched social challenges that stand in the way of people living full and productive lives with the disease
381242 this means confronting head on the discrimination and lack of opportunity that made so many vulnerable to the disease in the first place
381243 represent s for us in concrete form what we already knew in the abstract

381246 the novel is perhaps the only literary genre which is essentially connected with the medium of print
381247 the authority of print the impression that all that is printed is necessarily true
381248 it is paradoxical that the most powerful vicarious identification of readers with the feelings of fictional characters that literature had seen should have been produced by exploiting the qualities of print the most impersonal objective and public of the media of communication
381249 through bill and melindas exemplary efforts more than 9 billion in grants has been made available in the global health program of the foundation to help develop vaccines drugs and other health solutions to some of the deadliest and unfortunately most neglected diseases in the world

381260 narratives role in constituting the subject is double edged it assigns one a position of his her own but it also ensures that this position is thoroughly mediated by the desires of others

381278 narratives will usually prove anomalous because our models of narrative procedures are always based on models of reality
381279 the duality of narrative invites us to consider that one of the functions of narrative is to invent one time scheme in terms of another time scheme
381280 the second type prior narrating has until now enjoyed a much smaller literary investment and certainly even novels of anticipation from wells to bradbury which nevertheless belong fully to the prophetic genre almost always postdate their narrating instances making them implicitly subsequent to their stories
381281 the proustian novel is undoubtedly a novel of time ruled captured bewitched surreptitiously subverted or better perverted apropos of this novel how could we not speak as if the author does about dreaming and perhaps not without some ulterior motive of connection of the formidable game it creates with time
381282 in passing let us emphasize the verb used here create and not play a game with time is not only to play with time it is also to make a game of it but a formidable game in other words also a dangerous one

381298 but we do need to dedicate police resources to graffiti and to track down the ringleaders we know from our cctv cameras that the graffiti artists are organised and tend to work in groups of three to five they will have a watcher and then they will come in as a group with spray cans in their backpacks they spray their tags which can be reported and fed into police intelligence

381390 the israeli interior ministry say i have a lebanese passport
381391 apparently they think im planning to smuggle more palestinians into the country
381392 my male lead salah bakri is a 48 palestinian and so wasnt allowed to be in ramallah we had the same problem with my production manager and some other crew including the europeans like my director of photography benoit chamaillard
381393 we had about 80 locations around ramallah jerusalem and jaffa
381394 we were denied permission to shoot a very important scene at ben gurion airport so we ended up having to build a set and shoot it there
381395 all the gear for the shoot was in the back of my production managers beat up old pick up truck a silver mitsubishi that old truck got shipped to marseilles because it was cheaper than renting a vehicle in france he left it there
381396 theres a key aerial shot we needed from a helicopter approaching jaffa from the sea since im a security risk the israelis wouldnt give me permission to be in the helicopter for the shot so my camera operator had to shoot it alone
381397 we had plenty of police visiting the set and harassing salah
381398 one day the israeli army blew up the nazareth restaurant my french production designer franciose joset had been there just half an hour before that sort of things very upsetting for the european crew
381399 im not sure but i think this is the only film shot inside israel without israeli line producers when i told my friends i planned to shoot in palestine they told me it would be impossible i told them wed show them it could be done and we did
381400 the way people supported us when they found out what the film was about
381401 was really amazing so many people went out of their way to help us bringing us food and water we had extra production assistants everywhere we went
381402 a lot of our people were working on their first film a jewelry maker a dj kaza at the beginning of the process they had no experience making films but since we wrapped up the shoot theyve kept working there have been three features and seven or eight shorts shot around ramallah
381403 the films about her going to palestine and falling into life among the elite there when she meets this guy from amari camp she finds she cant relate to him at all but they connect
381404 its such a great honor to be premiered there especially with this year being the anniversary of the nakba
381405 but the film was such a labor of love for us and the people who helped us in the camp that it seemed more important to share that pleasure with them prestigious as cannes is theres a sense that this film is for us
381406 ive decided im going to screen the film in palestine anyway whether they let me in or not right now its scheduled for august 21 in al amari camp

381436 obama has benefited from a week of good images but substantively optimism without reality isnt eloquence its just disney
381437 what what do you make of this lets take another bite here because it was quite a speech you have to judge for yourself but the speech had its thrill factor certainly once again here he was
381438 and i think what barack obama is trying to say one of the messages that i heard was look im not some wooly headed liberal lefty that thinks we should all sing kumbaya together im here to tell them that we need international cooperation to beat the terrorists to beat the extremists to win the war in afghanistan but i think for the american voter he was saying look im here speaking for our national security interests my metaphor is the wall that reagan used not john kennedys metaphor
381439 obama doesnt have to equal mccain in foreign policy and national security issues he just has to make voters seem like hes okay he knows what hes talking about
381440 why cant obama bring himself to acknowledge the surge worked better than he and other skeptics including this page thought it would what does that stubbornness say about the kind of president hed be
381441 the price of oil has been high the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
381442 hey dont turn your back on those people open the circle out
381443 but i never said i knew what i was doing i was just telling you what i read today

381446 it could take more the further down into the fiscal year that you get and the greater the savings that you need because the economy has moved further away from you the deeper you have to make reductions
381447 im in a pretty unique situation i can see the worry on the faces of some people when we get one on one and start talking about it or in small groups
381448 its something to worry about if youve got roots here youve got a home kids in school
381449 this package is what it is anything that we did do in the future if we decided to do something in the future would be at best comparable
381450 the good news is theres been no acceleration in the official data
381451 the bad news is theres nothing about the data that suggests improvement anytime soon
381452 its not that unemployment is rising because a lot of people are coming into the labor force
381453 and really what matters in the end is whats taking place in payrolls and the unemployment rate and theyre both moving in the direction of a labor market recession how can you argue with that
381454 i want to be an artist get married have a son im not asking for it now but one day when that day comes i can sit back and relize ive done it ive lived my dream i can now die a happy irishmen but until then i can deal with what ever shit comes my way i always do

381474 most of the visitors attracted by the festival came from saudi arabia the united arab emirates oman and a number of gulf cooperation council gcc states
381475 this will revive tourism in al mukalla and hadhramaut and at the same time it has created many job opportunities for many people during the festival
381476 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
381477 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with and who probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
381478 from what im understanding i think im officially the second fastest guy in the family and theres only two of us in here
381479 i felt we probably hurt art some because we played him inside and he even blocked for us in there
381480 it probably cost him some yards on average per catch
381481 you know he coached art first before he transferred over to defense and coached me now you talk about something interesting
381482 what he brought to me was an appreciation and a knowledge of what i was doing and not to begin to try and adjust that but saying youre doing it youre doing what you need to do because i know what it takes at that position
381483 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way
381484 i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
381485 based on the nfls personalconduct policy and fabians agreement with the authorities we knew that a suspension was a possibility
381486 as well as the failure to allocate adequate financial budget to covers the expenses of technical aspects and maintenance
381487 the absence of public services in museums or the inexistence of cafeterias and visitors rest houses has an indirect impact on the reduction in the number of visitors
381488 an inappropriate and harmful method for the storage of these pieces
381489 they did not selected the right man for that place and the absence of a strategy to work and the distribution of tasks and marginalize the work of some departments and bureaucratic office and the omission of certain technical aspects of the most important factors are behind this decline
381490 fue una eliminatoria dif cil con un nivel f sico importante adem s recuerdo que el p blico era muy hostil al final remontamos un marcador adverso
381491 por ello creo que en este caso el partido de ida ser clave
381492 si no pasa nada antes del 31 de agosto me quedar aqu
381493 m s nos vale estar a tope porque lo vamos a necesitar
381494 m s nos vale estar a tope ya que lo vamos a necesitar seguro
381495 llegamos bien estamos en l nea ascendente en islandia no estuvimos del todo bien pero en el ltimo torneo de estrasburgo ya estuvimos bastante mejor a ver si seguimos en esta misma l nea en los ocho d as que nos quedan hasta debutar el d a 10 contra croacia porque m s nos vale estar a tope ya que lo vamos a necesitar seguro
381496 depende de c mo lo hagamos en el primer grupo si lo hacemos bien y ganamos a francia y a croacia o al menos a uno de los dos nos podemos meter primeros o segundos y tener te ricamente unos cuartos asequibles aunque nunca se sabe porque en atenas francia hizo primera se cruz con rusia y qued eliminada
381497 la aspiraci n de espa a debe ser pasar de cuartos y estar en la semifinal y la ilusi n es estar en la final venimos con esa ilusi n lo que pasa es que va a ser muy complicado
381498 el nivel es muy alto y hay muchos equipos en un nivel parecido francia croacia alemania polonia dinamarca rusia y espa a las medallas tienen que estar entre stos
381499 tenemos que estar a tope en la liguilla hacerlo muy bien en cuartos y estar a muerte en semifinales
381500 esto no es comparable en ning n aspecto a ninguna otra competici n en la que he estado es incre ble estoy encantad simo de la vida son mis primeros juegos y estoy flipando
381501 lo llevo un poco mal pero no porque suponga para m mayor responsabilidad sino porque echo de menos a mis compa eros y me resulta un poco dif cil estar aqu sin ellos as que ser como un plus intentar dar la cara por ellos tambi n
381502 lo llevo bien porque hace mucho calor y se suda bastante me estoy quitando cosas de comer y estoy comiendo sobre todo fruta echo de menos el chocolate y un chulet n pero por ahora lo llevo bien
381503 llego en un buen momento porque clasificarme para los jjoo en europa es bastante dif cil la prueba es que se han quedado medallistas europeos fuera
381504 un buen resultado ser a lograr un diploma pero yo voy a luchar por todo por eso un diploma puede no ser suficiente si luego veo que puedo optar a medalla necesito tener suerte en el sorteo y esquivar a los mejores que en mi peso son los chinos cubanos franceses rusos y kazajos
381505 estoy entrenando muy bien ahora no me preocupan mis rivales en la competici n yo sigo mis propios pasos sigo mi propio camino
381506 espero que pueda conseguir la medalla de oro en los 100 metros para eso que estoy aqu en pek n

381540 given good weather we are confident that the eisteddfod will generate up to 8m for the local economy
381541 the signs are very positive for attendances helped by the location of the eisteddfod site at pontcanna close to the city centre and also the fact that this years event is being held in the capital
381542 the interest can be illustrated by the fact the caernarfon based coach company silver star holidays is this year bringing more than twice the number of people they normally take to the eisteddfod
381543 the eisteddfod offers a fantastic opportunity for people from all over wales to visit their capital and hopefully many will come not only in august but return in the future
381544 a myth that circulates suggests that the eisteddfod is for welsh speakers only and that is completely wrong
381545 it belongs to the people of wales whether or not people speak welsh
381546 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
381547 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
381548 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
381549 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
381550 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done

381562 s upport policies where illegal immigrants are found and documented to inform officials know who they are they have been here illegally and therefore they have to go through the whole process like everybody else does of getting back into country
381563 anybody whos trying to misrepresent that is really stretching whats going on but my intention is we got to find them document them get them out of the country if theyre people who are trained whove been successful at this point put them at the back of the line and let them go back through the process and certainly what we need to do is raise the number of people we have coming to this country maybe change the visa system so we can extend those visas for longer than the period of time that were getting right now those are all options and ways to present this problem

381623 theres been a significant rehabilitation of what used to be the projects but theres still a sense of community that transcends that for the people that lived there then and now
381624 the importance is that this is a continuation of a community we started back in the housing development and theres a close relationship among the people that lived there

381674 then i have to put out a tender for a company to fix the wall then i have to see if i have enough money in my budget to pay for the repair and then finally the work begins

381677 the situation here is so immense that ordinary means havent been able to control it
381678 i truly hope that hes able to do everything he wants to but at pompeii no one wants to change anything
381679 pompeii is a government responsibility its a world heritage site and they dont want it to become too much of a disneyland
381680 the concern is that private investment will swing interests into making money at pompeii rather than its cultural upkeep and the assurance that funds are given over to conservation

381720 i dont take any time off i was taught a long time ago by bill parcells to never let the wheels fall off
381721 its important to have a water glass or water goblet that can also be used for iced tea
381722 in a formal setting glasses can number up to five

381725 the stem of a white wine glass is taller than red wine glasses that is because the white wine glass should be held by the stem and not the bowl because normally white wine is served chilled and the heat of the hand affects the wine
381726 i think in days gone by breakfast was served and everyone sat at the table and ate breakfast
381727 thats why when you go to flea markets you do find a lot of sets of juice glasses but those can also double as european wine glasses

381738 they really put it at a perfect time of year
381739 its the start of school and the beginning of the month and every little bit helps
381740 but the tax free weekend is definitely an added bonus
381741 i think itd be a good idea if they did this every year at this time
381742 tax free or not youd have seen me here today
381743 i was expecting it to be more than it was ive got three to do school shopping for and were on a budget but our house burned down earlier this year so were on a budget anyway

381828 next thing i know the window is sliding open and this 20 year old female opens the curtain
381829 i told her what the bleep are you doing in my apartment
381830 at first the baby was over here like on the other side of my window
381831 its sad to see these mothers not caring about their kids and everything else
381832 why do they have the right to have their kids when i cared about my son and hes no longer here
381833 opponents would have you believe that greater manchester does not have a congestion problem and that somehow it will magically avoid having to deal with what is a growing issue for every city region in the world
381834 this latest research from the dft shows greater manchester has the slowest rush hour roads in the country and this will only get worse further damaging our economy and way of life
381835 whoever has done this must have seen the notice outside the shop this has shown total disrespect
381836 ali had lived with me in rochdale for five years i am his uncle but he was just like a son to me we were very very close
381837 he was the friendliest most pleasant lad you could ever meet he was always smiling and it cheered you up just seeing his happy face well really miss him
381838 it was real good backing up after sundays tough game especially through the heat
381839 the players responded really well the defence was fantastic and i thought we forced the error on them and caused them some problems there are still areas to work on we only had a 60 per cent completion rate which was disappointing
381840 but roll on sunday against blackpool we need to tighten up and hopefully keep improving we identified this as being a real tough week for us so it would be nice to come through with maximum points and consolidate a finals spot once you are in the finals anything can happen our priority is sunday so lets see how we go
381841 my children were devastated because there was absolute mayhem in the garden
381842 when we came home we saw the dog but it ran off leaving the guinea pigs dead on the lawn it was heartbreaking
381843 the dog looks like a wolf with a long snout and piercing blue eyes when the first incident happened i convinced myself that it couldnt get through to the guinea pigs but i was wrong
381844 we have spoken to the dog warden and we believe there is a siberian husky somewhere in the area but they wont say where
381845 i would appeal to anyone who owns a dog like this to keep it inside because next time it could attack a cat a dog or even a baby
381846 i was out walking the dog when i saw archers on the golf course
381847 ive got a lot of friends when i go shooting and it means i get to spend lots of time with them
381848 this marks the culmination of more than a years work to remove those people from our communities who continue to spread drugs and exploit addicts
381849 i am really pleased with the result and hope it sends a clear message to other offenders and the local community that we will continue to work hard to reduce drug dealing and the massively detrimental affect it has on people
381850 we will keep trying to seize any assets that these offenders got from selling drugs and will be making applications under the proceeds of crime act
381851 a lot of seniors dont like to bother the police ms parker said in a recent interview
381852 but to keep safe you have to have an open line of communication i can be that line of communication
381853 the program allows seniors to have that go to person he said in an interview
381854 there would have been negative consequences if this program had not been in place const
381855 fraudsters can build an identity from a few key pieces of information she said
381856 the program allows seniors to stay longer in their homes and remain independent ms parker said
381857 it lifts my heart to know shes coming to check on me and see that im safe he said in a telephone interview
381858 ben has left the club and i think it was paramount for both parties that he move on
381859 he has never achieved his potential here or at any of the clubs he has been at
381860 i know when i offer gary jones a three year contract that he will give every ounce of sweat and blood in his body for the duration of that contract i couldnt be certain of that with ben
381861 as a friend id still sit and have a beer and a chat with him and i wish him all the best he still has potential though hes 25 now and i hope things work out for him
381862 some of the young lads who start at big clubs often come to a lower division club believing they have a right to earn a living as a professional footballer so when we demand they achieve the same intense fitness levels as our players at the club it can be something of a shock to them
381863 michael was not the kind of player we need right now and its too early to judge gavin who played 45 minutes at hyde and scored
381864 everyone at the club will be on trial this season to an extent
381865 these players did very well last season and reached the play offs but everybody will be looking to see if that was a one season wonder or if they have it within themselves to improve on last season
381866 gracie is adamant that there were no brass knuckles used that they were not used on bernie ingraham
381867 he admits he hurt ingraham and it was his fists that hurt him hes a strong man
381868 it was not the use of a weapon that hurt him
381869 its more good luck and good fortune than good management that were not dealing with a death here today
381870 im not really a good speaker but id like to say im sorry
381871 there tends to be a peak of incidents during this weekend
381872 i just always remember the natal day weekend wed hear about an incident or two or three so thats one of the reasons we want to remind people to be safe and particularly if youre going to be around water
381873 the majority of the population will comply with the law
381874 if youre only required to have it on board thats what people will do to comply we can educate people to actually wear the devices but like anything people sometimes do the minimum
381875 sometimes people go on outings on occasion and they dont feel like making the investment and actually purchasing them
381876 we want to reduce the barriers for people to have these things and more importantly that they wear them
381877 if you learn how to nurse with less resources than you ever felt possible or to be in a clinic where maybe they dont have supplies and they dont have electricity i think it just makes you resourceful and helps you go with the flow
381878 its unfortunate but if id been working for 10 years thatd be a different story
381879 i know that kenya is going to be a far cry from the gambia
381880 the gambia is a small country and has been relatively stable for a number of years and kenya is much bigger and has a lot more going on at this point
381881 the fact that there were two missionaries attacked in a country of 36 million people its the only thing ive heard in the last few months its a very big country theres a lot of people theres a lot going on
381882 todd rideout leaves the contractor desk with the nailer tight to his leg and walks past the gatehouse without paying for the nailer
381883 todd rideout drives up to the gatehouse exits his vehicle and tells the gatekeeper he is only purchasing a bag of topsoil the gatekeeper accepts payment for the topsoil and todd rideout drives out of the compound without paying for the boards or any other product
381884 i mean there is always a concern about the safety to the community and to the firefighters and emergency personnel who have to respond to these but this one the other night put someones life in jeopardy
381885 no team came off despondent or deflated and also none were heavily defeated or embarrassed
381886 they came off buoyant that they had just played a team from europe and all wanted to know more about them
381887 it was a great opportunity for the players and a chance for bridge colts to form a friendship with both maltese clubs and look to continue a relationship in the future
381888 in an era when newspapers are under extraordinary economic pressure this measure will result in the abandonment of news racks by many publications in many areas adversely affecting the flow of information to the public and those involved in the distribution network

381890 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
381891 its broad based weakness not huge declines anywhere but very widely spread
381892 its a slow drop deterioration not catastrophic but every month it gets worse
381893 there are some real macro indicators that point to unemployment spiking
381894 its ugly there are just not a lot of jobs out there
381895 theyre sending me e mails of customer service positions at 10 an hour
381896 right now refining in general is just not an attractive business in the u s
381897 theyre still showing very strong earnings overall but they do need to operate the refineries well
381898 california is being disproportionately hit by the housing and credit crisis
381899 this has created what we feel is a negative consumer sentiment thats causing people to do less discretionary driving
381900 its quite a long list and probably will differentiate chevron from our competitors
381901 the voting system in the u s is still not sufficiently accurate to determine the winner in a very close election
381902 by the time were done with the mock election nobody will have any doubt
381903 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
381904 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service

381906 i thought it was my baby maybe stuck in the crib but i came out and she was fine
381907 then i looked out the window and i saw some people running around
381908 it wasnt a big fire at the time but within minutes it just escalated
381909 the guy thats next door to the fire victims the back part of his house from the heat and that all his siding is off it didnt burn the wood on his house but his siding is totally gone
381910 this is a celebration of the reopening of a traditional supervised swimming area in historic point pleasant park
381911 i am concerned about the potential inappropriate use of taxpayers money
381912 a process should be in place to ensure that all current and future board members are aware of all the guidelines that directly relate to them
381913 when expenditures are incurred for which the business purpose may not be self evident a more detailed explanation should be included with the supporting documentation
381914 when we got the audit we did make changes to the travel and expense policy of the board
381915 we made some internal changes for the senior management people mainly surrounding documentation
381916 im not sure id say a corporate culture of frugality is the expression but a corporate culture of accountability
381917 there is clearly a focus on being more efficient and trying to be accountable to the people of canada absolutely
381918 the minister when he took office he made sure crown corporations under his watch would show accountability and taxpayers dollars would be well invested
381919 the conservative government has delivered on its promise to clean up government unlike the past liberal government
381920 the minister takes action and at the end of the day theres a replacement at the helm of this crown corporation
381921 theres no doubt about the importance of having good access to information law that we can rely on
381922 well see what happens at the end of the summer
381923 if its still clean that means its in pretty good shape
381924 if its still pretty clean in the middle of august then its probably getting there
381925 there really isnt much industrial stuff very few metals no pcbs
381926 people better be wearing some shoes when they go to black rock beach
381927 divers have removed debris and physical hazards and halifax regional municipality has cleaned the beach and added new sand
381928 buoys and nets have been installed to indicate the supervised area
381929 as a result of the harbour cleanup specific water and sediment quality testing shows levels that are well within acceptable guidelines for both swimming and recreational contact
381930 we have a lot of water theres a lot more opportunities
381931 im a real down to earth guy thats had a lot of problems in my life since birth
381932 i am a complicated guy theres too much to tell either love me or hate me but either way im me
381933 yeah its true it was me that cut the two girls but dat was a long time ago i have changed i just want a good life from now on and another chance
381934 i dont think theyve shut down any angles in their investigation
381935 if the same thing happened to this mayor i would totally sympathize
381936 what it illustrates is how the technologies for surveillance have developed at the speed of light but the law that controls how those technologies can be used is still back in the stone age
381937 weve got to develop some rules of the road here to protect our privacy
381938 we can sustain this weve been in dispute for a week and there has been action every day in most departments
381939 were really geared up for the weekend its a big weekend in sky city because of the bledisloe cup and its absolutely business as usual
381940 jesus and the god of israel god crucified and other studies on the new testaments christology of divine identity
381941 as a colleague at cambridge put it to me ro was an interesting movement that deserved attention
381942 its ok if we change the god or chant other gods name its life thats most important
381943 empathic care giving agency emerges or fails to emerge within the complex dynamic field of human sociality which is constituted by tensive personal relations one of the most significant tensions that shape this existential field is between fear and love like all living organisms humans tend to avoid that which seems to threaten destruction and pursue that which seems to promise pleasure our experience of feeling with or feeling for others is ambiguous social interaction is structured by both our longing for and dread of being bound to one another we fear being suffocated or absorbed by needy others but we also fear being isolated or abandoned by significant others whom we hope will fulfil our needs we desire independence from the painfully overwhelming demands of others but our overwhelming desire for pleasurable intimacy demands our dependence on others and so sociality is characterized by pushing away and pulling close an interactive play of repulsive and seductive forces that shape our capacity to become compassionate
381944 the more you know about someone the easier it is to become friends with them
381945 i genuinely believe in my heart of hearts with the way that i felt at the end of last season that i will come back this season
381946 ive trained through the summer and i genuinely feel ill be fine but until youve gone out there and done it it means nothing
381947 ive got to go and do the very best i can to stay at manchester united because thats the only place where i really want to play football
381948 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
381949 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed then we will look forward
381950 i came here to this tournament to look at my team for the game against portsmouth and i need to prepare my team for that game
381951 if i have a chance to put three or four more players into the game i will if not i will follow my idea for the game against portsmouth
381952 it is hypocrisy personified tottenham are complaining about things they have done themselves
381953 they took away our manager and now they are complaining that others are trying to take their players
381954 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
381955 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
381956 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him the fact that he is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
381957 i feel we deserve praise because we were not stupid and kept the player in the reserves
381958 over the past 10 years arsenal have been one of the top three clubs in developing young players
381959 immature fruit has a chocolatey taste and is often nibbled by children
381960 during the 18th century the french chemist missa discovered that by grinding the immature fruit of linden trees with dried linden flowers he could obtain a produce that had an aroma similar to chocolate the process was tentatively commercialized in germany but the large scale production of linden chocolate was quickly abandoned as it was soon discovered that the product did not keep well

381966 i would like to say that several months ago in detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged veterans testified to war crimes committed in southeast asia they told stories that at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in a fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country

381972 la procura generale ha ritenuto che i giudici dellappello non abbiano applicato come dovevano i principi stabiliti dalla cassazione era del resto lunico modo per arrivare a impugnare la sentenza
381973 invece disegnato con principi a maglie molto larghe il che rende difficile intervenire mentre il primo requisito netto bisogna essere del tutto certi che lo stato vegetativo sia irreversibile e allora c poco da fare o si certi o non lo si e la procura generale ha riscontrato linsufficienza di indagine su quel requisito
381974 posto che limpugnativa della sentenza della corte dappello relativa alla non certezza dellirreversibilit dello stato vegetativo di eluana englaro dobbiamo avere ben chiaro un principio il diritto davanti a situazioni di incertezza sceglie sempre la via pi rigorosa vale a dire la pi precauzionale e quella che pi tutela il soggetto riguardo al quale vige quellincertezza mi spiego ancora meglio il diritto di fronte a unincertezza che coinvolge un soggetto non pu prendere la strada a lui sfavorevole ma sempre ripeto sempre e potrei citare decine di norme del nostro ordinamento a questo proposito quella pi favorevole al soggetto
381975 ma questo andrebbe contro la stessa sentenza della cassazione la quale considera che quella sospensione pu essere attuata solo se quella certa persona non potr mai risvegliarsi ma se permane lincertezza e anche se la possibilit del risveglio remota ma non impossibile non immaginabile che quella vita possa essere spenta e un punto sul quale dobbiamo essere rigorosissimi se non c la certezza scientifica dellirreversibilit non c il requisito chiesto dalla cassazione

382043 i think this is a bold important step by the governor to provide some clear direction of the things that could be done to manage for healthy sage grouse populations as well as to allow a healthy energy industry to continue in the state
382044 not only is this bird in real risk of extinction range wide but its protection also protects an entire sage brush ecosystem with many other species that are being driven to the brink of extinction including the pygmy rabbit and the white tailed prairie dog
382045 sage grouse listing might be the only thing that could slow the breakneck pace of oil and gas development in wyoming and rein it in to a reasonable rate of drilling
382046 if the sage grouse was listed there certainly would be a lot of areas throughout the state where sage grouse habitat is not involved where drilling could continue
382047 we believe its a defensible position we believe its a biologically sound way to address the species
382048 were optimistic that this is going to maintain our bird population and in fact that we may actually increase our number of birds
382049 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks

382069 why would i have all that documentation we are not a police state and i dont have to carry identification
382070 i explained i lived a long way away and had my credit card knew the registration number and had the keys but none of that cut any ice i asked to speak to a supervisor but was told they would give the same answer
382071 they said they wouldnt release my car unless the police put a stamp on the papers but the police did not have a stamp
382072 all i wanted was for my son to enjoy a nice day out in camden who else but the owner would know my car had been towed know its registration and have the key to start it and offer to pay 260
382073 it was an awful day i complained and simply received a patronising letter i am now suing

382084 you can sense the mood when you are on the streets of ahmedabad no one will suggest that such a big tragedy has taken place here i think people are fed up the intensity of godhra riots tired them out they know whatever happens the loss will be theirs
382085 yesterday it was bangalore today ahmedabad tomorrow someplace else we cant stop this we must go on
382086 there are blasts everywhere theyve become commonplace here its felt blasts can disturb communal peace people know that if this had to blow up it would have by now both communities understand the reality better earlier if one man got hit ahmedabad would burn but now both communities have come together there is no point in riots even gujarat government doesnt want that
382087 riots mean losses in business should we riot or work raksha bandhan is round the corner hindus want to sell their wares and so do muslims no one wants disruption
382088 people want to concentrate on livelihoods thats the priority anything that reduces earning capacity would not be supported or participated in
382089 communal harmony has remained intact so far as today is concerned if i may say people have shown maturity they have not been disturbed by blasts
382090 this calm is for real as normalcy requires both communities should come closer but relations have certainly not improved divide is complete hindu friends are not coming closer to us after 2002 they are keeping distance despite the fact we were very close they no longer visit my home while previously they were coming for iftar

382128 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
382129 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
382130 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
382131 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
382132 around the world christians are being increasingly targeted and even persecuted for their religious beliefs now one of the largest organizations in the united nations is pushing to make a bad situation even worse by promoting anti christian bigotry
382133 we must put an immediate end to this most recent dangerous attack on faith that attempts to criminalize christianity
382134 which states that all rights are subject to sharia law and makes sharia law the only source of reference for human rights
382135 the position of the eclj in regards to the issue of defamation of religion resolutions as they have been introduced at the u n human rights council and general assembly is that they are in direct violation of international law concerning the rights to freedom of religion and expression
382136 the defamation of religion resolutions establish as the primary focus and concern the protection of ideas and religions generally rather than protecting the rights of individuals to practice their religion which is the chief purpose of international religious freedom law
382137 furthermore defamation of religion replaces the existing objective criterion of limitations on speech where there is an intent to incite hatred or violence against religious believers with a subjective criterion that considers whether the religion or its believers feel offended by the speech

382144 christianity has had its violence and its wars the crusades the inquisition the persecution of jews which culminated in the horrors of the nazi regime and more recently in the us the campaign of terrorism and murder directed against health clinics
382145 so kill all the male children and kill all the women who have ever slept with a man but spare the lives of the young girls who have never slept with a man and keep them for yourselves
382146 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves
382147 gays and gay marriage sorting through the hype to find a happy and just balance
382148 we will not marry this couple because our faith forbids it
382149 in order to get legally married a couple must obtain a civil marriage licence and find someone who is legally able to wed them in law that person may be a pastor or a priest or a minister or a rabbi and the legal marriage may take place simultaneously with the religious marriage but the two are distinct
382150 yes the catholic church in massachusetts decided to close down catholic charities that is the religious hierarchy decided that a religious charity should close its doors thats sad because catholic charities had done excellent work finding parents for hard to parent children but it was the catholic church who closed down catholic charities not a secular organisation
382151 catholic charities was closed down because they refused to give children to gay couples
382152 allowing children to be adopted by persons living in such unions would actually mean doing violence to these children in the sense that their condition of dependency would be used to place them in an environment that is not conducive to their full human development
382153 it would be better for such a person to be thrown into the sea with a millstone round the neck than to be the downfall of a single one of these little ones
382154 a terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead on target with a scud but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere
382155 no need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters al qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels and make sure to get it a few miles in the air
382156 an electromagnetic pulse emp attack on the american homeland said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing is one of only a few ways that the united states could be defeated by its enemies terrorist or otherwise
382157 and it is probably the easiest a single scud missile carrying a single nuclear weapon detonated at the appropriate altitude would interact with the earths atmosphere producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light depending on the location and size of the blast the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental united states for months if not years
382158 several potential adversaries have or can acquire the capability to attack the united states with a high altitude nuclear weapons generated electromagnetic pulse emp a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication
382159 emp is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
382160 emp will cover the wide geographic region within line of sight to the nuclear weapon it has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures and thus to the very fabric of u s society as well as to the ability of the united states and western nations to project influence and military power
382161 so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military coupled through critical infrastructures
382162 their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation
382163 briefly a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the united states will interact with the earths atmosphere ionosphere and magnetic field to produce an electromagnetic pulse emp radiation down to the earth and additionally create electrical currents in the earth
382164 emp effects are both direct and indirect the former are due to electrical systems and the latter arise from the damage that shocked upset damaged and destroyed electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded the indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects
382165 what is different now is that some potential sources of emp threats are difficult to deter they can be terrorist groups that have no state identity have only one or a few weapons and are motivated to attack the u s without regard for their own safety
382166 rogue states such as north korea and iran may also be developing the capability to pose an emp threat to the united states and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter
382167 few if any people would die right away but the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of u s society communication would be largely impossible lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas which is pumped with electricity the inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires which would rage unchecked and as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order
382168 american society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own achilles heel of vulnerability ironically much greater than those of other less developed nations
382169 when deprived of power we are in many ways helpless as the new york city blackout made clear in that case power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help but a large scale burnout caused by a broad emp attack would create a much more difficult situation not only would there be nobody nearby to help it could take years to replace destroyed equipment
382170 but it will take leadership by the department of homeland security the defense department and other federal agencies along with support from congress all of which have yet to materialize
382171 the sept 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of imagination no one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on sept 11 today few americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity but this time weve been warned and wed better be prepared to respond
382172 i believe president bush is going to order air strikes on iran before he leaves office
382173 george w bush and richard b cheney have created the most secretive presidency of my lifetime their secrecy is far worse than during watergate
382174 je vois plus que jamais quil ne faut juger de rien sur sa grandeur apparente
382175 a firm belief that one day this current us president and the american officials will be tried in a fair international court for the atrocities committed in iraq
382176 so long as iran views itself as a crusade rather than a nation a common interest will not emerge from negotiations
382177 its not going to be the same ballgame in some of those safe districts because theyre not safe anymore
382178 i dont know if anybody who voted for 872 was thinking cool this means we can have two republicans running against each other for governor
382179 you can imagine people figuring this out and saying lets take one social conservative and try to knock off that wimpy business guy who wants to play with the democrats
382180 there could be a lot of that it just depends on how long it takes this to work itself out
382181 the idea of safe seats where only the hardcore true believers vote in the primary tends to result in people more from the ends of the party spectrum as opposed to the middle
382182 such others as the major part of us shall admit into the same fellowship of vote with us
382183 a universal law that prohibits the defamation of any prophet or religion
382184 we are not aiming at collective punishment but when the danish and dutch people put pressure on their governments to support the creation of an international law we are achieving our goal
382185 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chap stick i kissed a girl just to try it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it it felt so wrong it felt so right dont mean im in love tonight i kissed a girl and i liked it i liked it
382186 if a man lieth with another man as he does with a woman both of them have commited an abomination
382187 but doesnt this mean that the law must be followed to the letter in consequence of having much practiced the letter
382188 what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out 13 how much better then is a man than a sheep
382189 and it came to pass that he went through the cornfields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they passed to pluck the ears of corn
382190 it is very difficult to understand why a paralyzed man would be beaten by a chicago officer except to explain it as wanton brutality
382191 are you looking at her as a sister in christ right now

382199 nel corso della storia i motivi della caduta di una civilt dice mel gibson sono sempre gli stessi e molti degli eventi che hanno preceduto la fine dei maya sono quelli che si verificano nella nostra societ oggi questi cicli si ripetono continuamente

382201 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
382202 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
382203 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

382207 even a production operator just out of high school we have to invest 6 000 to 10 000 in education before we can put them on the floor
382208 if you look at fundamental education where were already getting the top talent out of universities we still have to make a large investment in them
382209 we can hire an engineer who can check things off and make sure a drawing is ok but if you want to do clean sheet design and new technology were talking about a 20 000 investment
382210 first we need to have trade policies that are fair
382211 trading with our partners in the global economy we have to make sure that we realize the decisions were making now are going to affect us down the road investments into our work force making sure we renegotiate the unfair trade agreement to make sure those companies cant come in here and dump their steel and other products into our economy that will undercut the products that companies like luk have been able to make
382212 people want to go to work they want to punch a time clock and give their kids the opportunity to go to college
382213 what weve found is that unemployment in the congressional district has doubled in the last eight years the cost of a college education has doubled and the cost of fuel has almost tripled its becoming harder and harder for ordinary people to do the things that make our communities great weve got to have strategic investment by the government into the things thatll help companies like luk im sure their health care costs are astronomical thats going to be a huge issue in the next congress
382214 we spend 12 billion a month in iraq could you imagine what ohio could do with a month of that kind of money to help companies like wooster brush and luk its extremely frustrating four times weve been in wayne county touring facilities from usa metals to wooster brush and luk and the common theme is that they want the government to be responsive and to be fully aware of the issues that are holding them back from being competitive globalization and the short sighted decisions weve made are holding our country back

382216 we have received several calls regarding what valuation is used to calculate the cost of the levy because of how the ballot language reads
382217 its important for people to know that there are two valuations used to calculate taxes
382218 if you have a 100 000 home you may mistakenly think your cost would be 372 when it is actually 130 which does not include any reductions that amount is actually less about 113 when factoring in the 12 5 percent in tax reductions given to owner occupied homes
382219 there has been a lot of interest in this election
382220 we have had 611 early and absentee voters already and that doesnt include provisional ballots normally we get 300 to 400 early voters total for a special election tops
382221 i was disappointed they never visited with our community to see if we could help them in enlarging their employment here
382222 to have a company leave after so many years here isnt easy i know they had property available out there to grow if thats what their ambition was but its just sad to see them moving on
382223 wed like to learn more about them and what they have in mind for the future of the facility
382224 i dont know if they want to continue to own it and lease it or if theyd like to sell we have been working with a company for more than a year that is interested in that facility hopefully well be able to fill that space with another business
382225 this community seems to have a nice resiliency within its fabric we hope that continues there are folks here who work hard every day to help keep the jobs coming to wooster and well keep at that hopefully this is just a minor blip in the whole network of businesses of wooster
382226 were only five blocks from the capitol and its a different world
382227 we spent the day dry walling putting in heating and air conditioning running electrical putting in insulation doing yard work
382228 it was a little bit of culture shock for some of them a little bit hard work shock
382229 i think for all of us this is a little bit out of the comfort zone
382230 its a little bit of learning a little bit of creating a want to serve later in life
382231 a lot of service trips you come home having built a church or built a school house and were not going to get this house done what we hope is that the kids take away that desire to serve later and hopefully act on it
382232 it was tough to putt any distance so it was all because of my chipping
382233 that was a lucky putt i was shaking on that one i thought if i missed it we were going to a playoff
382234 i had four 3 putts and on the back my swing left me for awhile
382235 there were just too many short putts i didnt make
382236 i was scrambling but i made a few long putts
382237 i made good contact today but i was off with my direction and i didnt have one decent birdie try
382238 i hit my driver consistently my irons were good and my putter was terrible
382239 sixteen was my downfall that was the only ball i hit out of bounds all day and if it wasnt for that id have been in the running
382240 but then i probably relaxed a little more and had a strong finish
382241 my putting was weak the greens were tough for me to read both the speed and the breaks
382242 i couldnt get it up and down real well but ill take my finish
382243 i putted better than normal my chipping was really good i played over my head especially on the front and then hung on for dear life on the back
382244 last year we were sitting here watching everyone play in the playoffs and this year we want everyone watching us play
382245 we all know that last year was last year and it was a disappointing 10 6
382246 this year we need to improve on that and strive to get better our goal is to make the playoffs
382247 i dont think were going to surprise anybody this year
382248 everyones going to be gunning for us and every week is a tough game
382249 the way i look at the afc north right now is that you still have to beat pittsburgh
382250 pittsburgh has been there ever since ive been here so we have to go through them and we still have cincy and baltimore to go through
382251 you thought should i try to break the pass up ive got to make sure im not forcing him out there was too much gray area this clears everything up and makes the game a lot simpler i welcome it
382252 its not so much that it favors the defense as much as it takes a lot of the guesswork out of the game
382253 i guess it is kind of helping the defense but its also making it easy on the referees too
382254 because a lot of big plays were made in the last year where it came down to was a guys foot inbound
382255 if hes in the air push him out of bounds as long as you dont carry him out of bounds its out of bounds
382256 were in the air trying to make a catch trying to get two feet in but the momentum of the defensive player is forcing us out of bounds theyre taking some of the guesswork out of it but theyre also taking away part of the offensive players game
382257 happens a lot because the best way to beat the cover two defense is the corner route
382258 when we play a cover two team thats what we do its a timing route
382259 i guess you just have to work more on getting your feet in bounds without getting forced out
382260 run patterns a little better and get separation so you wont have to worry about that
382261 as an offensive player its not my favorite rule change
382262 youre going to see some hits on the sideline defensive guys trying to blast an offensive guy if i was a defensive player id try to hit somebody and make sure they didnt land in bounds
382263 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
382264 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
382265 it never works in the present but it will work in some far off mythical moment that never comes
382266 hes pretty much the same player im pretty sure vizquel is his idol to mold your game after him and be at the same caliber is impressive
382267 people have opinions but i never try to do it like omar how he thinks about the game thats how i try to be like him
382268 freddys a potential 25 home run guy a guy who can do a lot of damage with the bat
382269 i get it every once in awhile it started to twinge on me in my last inning itll be fine
382270 hes got a chance to play and hes got a chance to not be healthy enough to play
382271 i wouldnt anticipate him being there for the opener or being there as a backup for games in september but i dont know how long it would be
382272 and i both want the same thing and the team wants the same thing
382273 for him to go out and play hes got to go out like jimmy dray and have total confidence in that knee that any direction he cuts moves no matter what pressure he puts on it thats hes going to be confident
382274 thats my goal i wouldnt train for this any other way my rehab is going well ive been cleared to start training and strengthening and im very excited
382275 i hope i can begin practicing in a couple of weeks i need to build muscle i just got cleared to start running doing underwater treadmill work and then i can get on the grass and get going
382276 were continuing to move mario around to both sides mario is not improving the way wed like him to so well just continue to push him but its not close right now
382277 im happy of course to still be in the league
382278 im used to starting from the ground up its just that when you come here you dont have any scholarships you cant sit around for four years you better get it now i still can get cut drafted or not
382279 i just have to work hard to show them that i was worth that pick that i was picked at
382280 when we traded for him and bill came to me to tell me about it we really didnt know what to expect but i knew instantly that i liked him
382281 there was a chain link fence running alongside ruston high stadium and fred swung that running back so hard the guy actually got caught underneath that fence
382282 they had to get wire cutters and everything to get this kid out
382283 i dropped the rifle on my toe and it fired
382284 i didnt realize there was still a bullet in the chamber it just went off
382285 i was afraid my mom and the coaches would get on me
382286 he went into the coaches office grabbed a doughnut and a cup of coffee and lifted up his jersey and showed them the bullet hole then they took him to the hospital and fred was afraid of needles
382287 coach walsh changed my life and so did mr d
382288 he was the most explosive undersized pass rusher i have ever seen he never lifted weights just did incredible things on the field
382289 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
382290 and that made me realize how great an owner he was and how much i finally belonged
382291 my father always said wait until its all signed on the dotted line
382292 it was slow going over my head and i didnt have a shot at it i dont think bobby had a play on it
382293 i would have thought they would have kept him two more months and won another championship hes a proven star its sad to see him go after all hes done for that organization i know he does a lot of crazy things but hes harmless sometimes you wear out your welcome ive been through it
382294 absolutely and everyone obviously has a lot of respect for jason bay
382295 but manny ramirez is the best right handed hitter of the era so yeah id rather not have him in their lineup than in their lineup
382296 billy was very straight up with me and that was something he didnt need to do
382297 on a personal level having a boss that will do that is really great
382298 i know im going to be no 1 getting no 1 is a present for a lot of work in the past so its satisfying
382299 i saw different aspects of the game at corner as far as knowing where the help from a safety is
382300 a lot of offensive guys would grab that facemask and push
382301 now if the db turns his head or jerks in any way and we have hold of his facemask thats a penalty i havent done it a lot but it happens
382302 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together
382303 its odd to have played a lot and then you might not play anymore
382304 but thats their decision its a weird situation to be in you just have to deal with it somehow and figure out a way to come in ready to play every day
382305 its about time we give them their due respect especially burriss
382306 its been a weird year in the sense that they said they were going to go young early on and then some guys didnt pan out so veteran guys got a chance to play and we played pretty well
382307 we ended up hanging around the race for a while because our division wasnt as strong as it was perceived to be
382308 i think all in all all the veteran guys who werent supposed to play played probably better than people expected ray durham myself jose castillo who is 27 i still think i have a lot of baseball to play in my career im not saying five or six years but i feel like i have a few more years in me
382309 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
382310 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is
382311 he had a great game against us a few years ago and was real brash about it
382312 this is what i do i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
382313 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball
382314 he has a big heart he plays hard ive said it before hes been one of the good surprises at camp
382315 hes played a lot better than i thought he could and hes fighting to be one of those tackles in the rotation hes doing a great job
382316 of course id like to play three technique where i can be a little quicker play on the edges but you know it is what it is ive just got to shut up and go do it
382317 every now and then throw a little power move at em or something its just working hard for a guy like me every play youve got to work hard whereas some of the bigger guys can maybe take a play off here or there i dont have that luxury
382318 its getting out of that indianapolis style too where its a little more under control staying in your pass rush lanes and all but its coming back to me
382319 well you have to make up for lack of size with other things quickness balance determination heart things like that thats what he has hes not a really big tackle but he does have quickness and its helped him
382320 probably his best camp i think he is really solid right now im happy with him
382321 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel
382322 he might be trying too hard to hold them down
382323 i dont see anything different hes still got good stuff
382324 but his best pitch is his changeup and hes been leaving it up in the strike zone in the last two games
382325 now that i think of it in the big innings ive given up i havent been able to locate down in the zone
382326 thats definitely an issue i have to be able to locate that pitch if i want to put the team in a position to win
382327 i wanted to help the team out especially with the winning streak
382328 my last start was poor and i wanted to redeem myself but i didnt do it
382329 its the only race track that we go to all year long that you can only run 4 5 6 laps of practice before the tires are completely worn out that means the surface is a factor
382330 it is a difficult tire to build its goodyears responsibility to try to do it goodyear has to find a way to build a tire that we dont have to go through the process of having to lay rubber down on that particular race track to get where we can race on it
382331 under the circumstances nascar did 100 percent the right things there was conversation that they should have just let the race go and leave it up to the teams thats ludicrous that thought process would get people hurt
382332 but its still one of my favorites tracks ive won at martinsville and dont like the place at all
382333 you put a lot of time in studying and youll get it
382334 yeah thats why ive got a chip on my shoulder now
382335 i know the game i want to compete i want to be good
382336 there aint no breeze in el paso this is nothing man
382337 i was kind of upset i didnt go earlier in the draft
382338 i was ready to practice right then and there that was the feeling in my heart i was fired up some people took it the wrong way im not a selfish player im a team player more than being a pro bowl player i want to win a super bowl to clear it up thats what i meant
382339 hey im just a pup in this league trying to become a dog
382340 these kind of guys are hard to find and we love to find these guys
382341 the quarterbacks are more accurate than in college thats the main thing
382342 so its timing you look back that much youll get beat
382343 cmon donovan turn around were right here do it for the kids
382344 it doesnt sound like jim its super clear and easy to hear
382345 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
382346 im perfectly fine this is the year im not going on the disabled list
382347 in the big innings my change up has been up
382348 i havent been able to locate it down thats definitely an issue i need to locate that pitch to have success
382349 dewey was out there with about 10 other mares and foals
382350 we just left dewey out in the field with the others to fend for himself
382351 i talked to my veterinarian janet durso and we made a decision to just let him go and see how he made out he was probably nursing off other mares while he was out there he would dive in and help himself
382352 when he was at the normal weaning age of about six months he was probably a little skinny and pot gutted
382353 within two or three months he looked just like all the rest of the weanlings
382354 we swim him and ride him and keep him happy
382355 deweys been very impressive theres no two ways about it
382356 hes been the dominant horse and he deserves all the accolades and respect
382357 he never gets rattled hes used to being by himself a lot of horses get nervous but he seems like nothing fazes him
382358 his contract like brian westbrooks is now outdated having outperformed the deal
382359 we have talked to the eagles and would like to work out a contract with them
382360 he wants something done before the season or as soon as possible
382361 im not going to categorize the eagles and their position but theres a sense of urgency on our end
382362 i play football i let him take care of that so whatever he can do its for the better
382363 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
382364 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
382365 the mets lost out on raul ibanez and every bullpen arm they chased
382366 the phillies targeted a lefthanded reliever for months and never found one the braves couldnt locate a taker for eminently available will ohman the nationals couldnt find a home for felipe lopez paul lo duca tim redding luis ayala or anyone else on the roster
382367 ill tell you i might take florida to win the east now
382368 arthur rhodes floridas one addition thursday can get those lefthanders on the phillies and mets out something renyel pinto and taylor tankersley couldnt do
382369 and nobody seems to know it but now that theyve got josh johnson and anibal sanchez back theyve got the best starting pitching in the division the phillies and mets have holes they need to address and neither one of them did it
382370 its hard to explain a lot of teams have trouble scoring runs at times we scored 20 runs and it seemed like our hitting went cold but at the same time i think we can hit
382371 i dont want to pitch him so much that i tire him out
382372 but as long as hes healthy and can go out there ill pitch him it seems like the more he pitches the better his command is but i dont want to overpitch him
382373 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
382374 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
382375 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
382376 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel well work with it more this week before we go into the preseason game it wasnt bad today
382377 in other words if stewart bradley got hurt and came out of the game wed have to switch helmets omar would have to put the other helmet on
382378 i feel great and im looking forward to coming out here every day and grinding it out and making plays im finally healthy my knees are finally strong i feel like my old self again im just going to try to continue that throughout the camp and throughout the season
382379 we just have to rely on quickness with our ends theres no doubt about it
382380 one thing that im very proud of this team for is that we never want to be fat and happy
382381 we never want to feel that we can sit back and things will take care of themselves
382382 i ran that lap and tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was
382383 i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have the pole
382384 everything every part of every corner nine different things all the way around the track
382385 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
382386 we have been blocked since 2003 the fact that our web site is unblocked is very good news
382387 when everything came down to it this was the situation that was all around the best for lou
382388 not just financially he enjoys the city he enjoys 76ers coach mo cheeks he enjoys his teammates
382389 you go with the flow but you knew they had to spend money on a free agent before they could move on to louis and andre igoudala
382390 we were patient with them we let them go through the elton brand situation they were patient with us as we went out and did our due diligence in finding louis fair market value
382391 rudys had some back problems and his shoulders been a little sore
382392 his last few times out he hasnt thrown good he looked like he couldnt bend over but hes one of those stubborn guys who wont tell when theyre hurt
382393 we got him as a starter and we havent had a very good look i feel like we definitely have to give him a better chance than that
382394 its their decision and im going to have to respect whatever they do
382395 whatever role they put me in theyre going to expect me to be ready
382396 well see what we can do we consider him a starter hes showed hes capable of pitching a good game when we put him out there
382397 cos honestly right using a condom is like fucking a plastic bag
382398 whichever guy who drives an atos i dont want to make friends with him its a girls car
382399 fucking screwed up spoilt brats thats why you call them brats anyway
382400 that girls face is what you call a rain collector
382401 so in the mean time i thank god for giving me a strong arm and useful hands
382402 why do you keep your music scores in the toilet
382403 theyre fucking slow i gave up on nikon a few months ago the digital stuff asyraf
382404 i look more like my dad and hes very pretty
382405 well guys will always talk about their girlfriends girls will only talk about their boyfriends when they do something wrong
382406 if theres indeed god in this world he surely is an odd bastard
382407 we should do this more often butching about people we barely know
382408 i want people to blog not for money but because they want to
382409 he planned my birthday celebration a whole day out with him like mummy and a little son going to the playground
382410 celebrity bloggers thats just plain crap and youngsters thinking that these people are like their idols
382411 righteous people are plain rude and should shut the fuck up
382412 new year 15 days you ought to stop saying wtf lo
382413 if the wii is open source you can design a tfk game
382414 this is the reason why i still ask the cousins to meet up this is why i still risk rejection and this is why i continue to hope
382415 im very loyal i dont screw around i just let people screw me
382416 the king of cups expects a picnic but this is not his birthday
382417 investors seem to have realized that the business yahoo is in is a very complicated and challenging one and the current macroeconomic environment is even more challenging
382418 so turning over the reins to an unknown quantity doesnt appear to be the prudent thing to do at the moment
382419 at no point did the board and management ever resist microsofts proposal
382420 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
382421 you are overpaid you have overstayed your welcome you overplayed your hand with microsoft
382422 because you start to think oh ive got the guy on this one then you throw that pitch again and bam its gone
382423 i had people try to help me with my bags at the airport
382424 this was a year long investigation which accrued a huge amount of evidence the jury deliberated for less than eight hours can they really say they gave due consideration to all the facts
382425 mr george feels overwhelmed by the verdict as throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and he continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
382426 i have spent hours and hours with barry george i would seriously doubt that someone with his level of problems could carry out the murder and i would expect someone who has his problems to let something slip but he never has
382427 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
382428 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case our test is whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
382429 i started thinking now is the right time for them and for me
382430 this is a huge opportunity and it is the right time to push that forward
382431 the linux desktop is something people have wanted for a long time and now its really happening
382432 theres a good chance your cell phone is running linux you dont really care but it is running linux thats a huge volume of users and theyre giving feedback on this end user platform
382433 you have huge volumes of these things shipping and people are getting linux they didnt get it because theyre huge believers in open source they got it because it works well thats a tipping point we can build on
382434 a lot of people have been joking about me being the top dog or big boss so i thought id point out that i work for the board of directors 7 volunteer part time directors who are doing a great job of running the gnome foundation my job is to make them and the gnome foundation even more successful
382435 when i first started working i had a boss who said stormy what can i do for you and ive stuck with that every since a managers role is to help people by working for them or with them to get things done these people are working on gnome because theyre passionate about that and im working for them
382436 trust people to do the right thing trust them to have good ideas to want to make the project organization team or company successful trust them they want to do good empower them make sure they know you trust and believe in them and give them what they need to execute on their great ideas maybe its a computer or a person to bounce ideas off of or help convincing others or some space or fun people to work with or a better understanding of what the company is trying to do
382437 its much more that i have to make my own business cards
382438 ive known for a long time that developers like open source software at hewlett packard i got lots of calls from developers who were excited about what they were doing and wanted to open source what they were doing developers just like open source because it works well they get to interact they get recognition at and said they consciously chose open source because it helps them retain developers i think youre starting to see more companies doing that ive talked to a lot of companies that are nobody i can quote for you though
382439 the default desktop for many linux distributions is gnome and a lot of people are using linux on the desktop i recently read a survey that said 46 of all enterprise users use openoffice org thats a good sign that the linux desktop is being used by a huge percentage of enterprise users
382440 at everyone wanted to say hi and show me what theyre working on i met with several hundred people its so much fun to be involved in the community and showing the world im part of the community im excited to be working with sponsors and get enterprises using gnome and helping to build those relationships i get energy from interacting with other people i enjoy talking to people and seeing their excitement
382441 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
382442 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people
382443 it was one of those things where we were like wow lets totally do it i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life

382476 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
382477 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
382478 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
382479 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
382480 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
382481 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
382482 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt
382483 had found another man and he did not want to have any kids around
382484 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
382485 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
382486 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
382487 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
382488 it was sort of an unspoken thing our family didnt talk about it at all
382489 but the circumstances of what we heard that she left without saying goodbye to her own children we knew she would never have done that a mother would never go off without saying goodbye to her own children

382509 hmmm man she was soo crazy you must have listened to her words in an anxiousness to meet me after one year
382510 hmmm come on guys just thing how many indians must have sacrificed their life under the britishers hands
382511 when one team is the champ you have to go with the champ until theyre knocked off
382512 thats why you have to lean that way apparently theres a reason that the giants were the champions last year
382513 we have a saying going into each week it all starts up front
382514 if we dont win the physical battle youre not going to win the game we take pride in that more and more teams are realizing that if you have an effective unit its best to keep them together
382515 people are realizing you cant just pay one offensive lineman a ton of money not pay anyone else and expect to have a great offensive line
382516 you have to have a good mixture a good combination the interior is just as important as the exterior
382517 take a look at the guys they are playing against
382518 youre looking across at defensive tackles who are 330 340 pounds guys with tremendous anchor and athleticism so youve got to have these blockers
382519 our guys are athletic they can pull they are physical nasty hard nosed players those guys are the face of our team down the stretch we were able to win the physical battles each game
382520 teams realize how much money they are spending on quarterbacks
382521 if youre going to spend millions on a home youd better invest in a home security system you dont leave the windows open and invite a free for all we protect the investment
382522 hes giving tremendous effort right now and thats his greatest asset
382523 hes a good leverage player and he has some pass rush ability and good speed but hes all over that field hes like the energizer bunny
382524 me and osi were talking about that today what am i
382525 its a work in progress and i need to get better at both of them but i can get the job done
382526 he affected tony romo on one play and on another play he made a great effort to prevent a first down
382527 he was effective in the fourth quarter in that game
382528 but i want to tell my kid if you work hard youll make it but if you work harder youre going to be good
382529 those last two years in college were like a third or fourth opportunity for me to play football
382530 i just grabbed it with the grip of death and ran as hard as i could i knew it was going to be my last opportunity to play in the nfl ever since then ive been a hard worker
382531 they said that if this doesnt work thats what theyll do next a shot back there i dont think thatll have to happen
382532 i dont like to bring a kid if the matchup is not favorable for him i love to look at young players and young talent no question about it i enjoy that so i would like that but at the same time it has to be a real good chance we feel we can win
382533 bill belichick showed a horse race one time in new england
382534 we were 5 5 the super bowl year in 2001 it was around the first bend he asked somebody well whos leading and somebody says horse 5 and he said well it really doesnt matter does it it really doesnt matter whos leading right here the point is that all that matters is where you finish not how youre running the race
382535 its all about coming out here and improving day to day
382536 you are going to make mistakes no one is perfect you learn from those and you try to eliminate repetitive mistakes you just try to get better with each day
382537 i think theyre both on a relatively short timeline but those timelines change all the time
382538 i want to see him here in this setting as opposed to pitching down there
382539 sometimes the setting heres a little bit different and im anxious to see if we can get him back to where he was
382540 the chances of us getting him back september 1st are zero
382541 as long as we felt he was healthy strong and ready to go i would not hesitate
382542 i would say it just happens i wish i could explain it or somebody could explain it to me
382543 its something that some closers go through for a period of time its just kind of an unusual season hes been unbelievable for us in save situations this year its been a little bit more difficult for him in non save situations
382544 hes pretty much owned me my entire career 1 for 9 plus friday nights walk any time you get on base against him its a plus
382545 mariano is incredible you dont get to him very often and its a full moon if he walks somebody
382546 our guy was outstanding it came down to a battle of the bullpens and they beat us
382547 thats as good as a pitchers thrown against us all year
382548 but regardless of whos pitching or how well theyre pitching were better than no runs
382549 it just feels good to be out there and unlike last year when youre stressed out and not knowing whats going on and you dont want to screw up this feels a lot better
382550 its definitely different not having a guy like jeremy in there an older guy who has been in the league for a while
382551 but were all making the effort to help each other out
382552 weve been here for a week everybodys a little grumpy everybodys been doing the same stuff and going against the same players
382553 they say youre not officially a giant until you fight richie in practice
382554 it was the first one in camp and it was all fun stuff
382555 sometimes i go out there and give up four five runs and the team will bounce back and win the ballgame those things happen its part of the game
382556 my mechanics was a lot better than it was in boston because my sinker was going downhill instead of going side to side
382557 i changed speeds kept them off balance and i couldnt have done it without my defense
382558 when the moment came around somehow i made quality pitches and got out of the inning
382559 ponson did what he had to do he threw his pitches when he had to and they made great defensive plays behind him fortunately ervin matched him pitch for pitch
382560 he used the analogy of the soldiers for when our guys are struggling out here and think its hot
382561 its 120 degrees in iraq and theyre wearing a hundred pounds worth of gear they are out there for four and five hours at a time im sure that analogy struck home with the guys
382562 i tell them about how all the players came up to me afterwards and first said how much they are indebted to the soldiers and marines in iraq
382563 they realize what they are giving up so they can do what they are doing here which is play professional football
382564 you hope all that bad stuff is gone away and if he can feel good and maybe get to that number of pitches and maintain a level of velocity and what have you youve got to feel like youve acquired somebody
382565 ive never been one for making a move for the sake of making a move
382566 i have no problem sitting still as of right now i have no problem finishing out the season with these guys
382567 dvd was transfered by francisco ortiz using a jvc hr 7700 and a digital conversor canopus advc 50 nn so qnt possa esservi utili
382568 its not going to be the same ballgame in some of those safe districts because theyre not safe anymore
382569 i dont know if anybody who voted for 872 was thinking cool this means we can have two republicans running against each other for governor
382570 you can imagine people figuring this out and saying lets take one social conservative and try to knock off that wimpy business guy who wants to play with the democrats
382571 there could be a lot of that it just depends on how long it takes this to work itself out
382572 the idea of safe seats where only the hardcore true believers vote in the primary tends to result in people more from the ends of the party spectrum as opposed to the middle

382597 the dream experience has been embodied by the greeks in their apollo
382598 people imagine themselves to be in company at the theatre but there we are alone we forget our relations our friends our neighbors to interest ourselves in fabulous representations mourn over the imaginary
382599 the true spectator must always remain conscious that he was viewing a work of art
382600 what ground is it right to hear what we must not speak look on what is disgraceful to do 90
382601 does all he can do to bring his spectator into the closest proximity to the events and the character he has to portray
382602 the performers self observation artistic act of self alienation stopped the spectator from loosing himself in the character completely
382603 the dream experience has been embodied by the greeks in their apollo
382604 people imagine themselves to be in company at the theatre but there we are alone we forget our relations our friends our neighbors to interest ourselves in fabulous representations mourn over the imaginary
382605 rehearsal of it stimulates a practice of the act in reality
382606 to practice in reality the act he has rehearsed within in the theatre the practice of these theatrical forms creates an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks fulfillment through real action
382607 masterpieces of the past are good for the past they are not good for us
382608 let us leave textual criticism to graduate students recognize that what has been said is not still to be said that an expression does not have the same value twice does not live two lives all words once spoken are dead and function only at the moment when they are uttered
382609 when i got the invitation letter i expected to see miss comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them
382610 men mor ved praesidenten ikke at det odelaegger en hel masse hvis man faelder regnskov
382611 jamen er der saa ikke nogen der kan fortaelle ham at det er forkert
382612 han har knap saa meget strithaar og han har ikke en skyder men han er i gang fra han slaar ojnene op til han dratter omkuld han er ikke fraek han er bare saa hamrende nysgerrig og vil saa gerne vaere med til alt
382613 aha hes tall we need a post man we could give him some milkshakes and twinkies and then send him to the weight room with our lithuanian trainer ivan then hell gain 15 pounds and well have another big guy to pound the boards
382614 har hun nu lus igen bwadr hvor ul kkert nej nu m de dog tage sig sammen derhjemme
382615 n ja det er jo s son nu og det er jo ikke noget man d r af
382616 a ship is always safe in the harbor but thats not what ships are for
382617 the good news is on the senate side theres clear agreement that this is important for the country and we have to get this done quickly the 2 presidential candidates thankfully have also come out and said we want to do this quickly house side is little more unclear part of this
382618 congress overwhelmingly approved the hyde act but it hasnt even looked at discussed held hearing on the 1 2 3 agreement in fact one of the concerns in the congress is that the 123 agreement in not consistent with the elements of the hyde act
382619 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
382620 for those children who were separated from their families or even orphaned by the cyclone the future is uncertain
382621 the number of childrens homes and orphanages is on the rise but it is not only orphans who end up living there children whose parents are still alive are being sent to institutions because nobody has yet traced their parents or extended families and those currently looking after them cant afford to continue to support them
382622 save the children has clearly demonstrated that aid given to myanmar can be effective and make a dramatic difference whilst still meeting international standards of accountability
382623 if donors break their promises and fail to give generously to the survivors of the cyclone they will be punishing the children of myanmar for a government that they have no control over
382624 his contract like brian westbrooks is now outdated having outperformed the deal
382625 we have talked to the eagles and would like to work out a contract with them
382626 he wants something done before the season or as soon as possible
382627 im not going to categorize the eagles and their position but theres a sense of urgency on our end
382628 i play football i let him take care of that so whatever he can do its for the better
382629 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
382630 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
382631 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
382632 he has a big heart he plays hard ive said it before hes been one of the good surprises at camp
382633 hes played a lot better than i thought he could and hes fighting to be one of those tackles in the rotation hes doing a great job
382634 of course id like to play three technique where i can be a little quicker play on the edges but you know it is what it is ive just got to shut up and go do it
382635 every now and then throw a little power move at em or something its just working hard for a guy like me every play youve got to work hard whereas some of the bigger guys can maybe take a play off here or there i dont have that luxury
382636 its getting out of that indianapolis style too where its a little more under control staying in your pass rush lanes and all but its coming back to me
382637 well you have to make up for lack of size with other things quickness balance determination heart things like that thats what he has hes not a really big tackle but he does have quickness and its helped him
382638 probably his best camp i think he is really solid right now im happy with him
382639 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel
382640 cmon donovan turn around were right here do it for the kids
382641 it doesnt sound like jim its super clear and easy to hear
382642 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel well work with it more this week before we go into the preseason game it wasnt bad today
382643 in other words if stewart bradley got hurt and came out of the game wed have to switch helmets omar would have to put the other helmet on
382644 i feel great and im looking forward to coming out here every day and grinding it out and making plays im finally healthy my knees are finally strong i feel like my old self again im just going to try to continue that throughout the camp and throughout the season
382645 we just have to rely on quickness with our ends theres no doubt about it
382646 you put a lot of time in studying and youll get it
382647 yeah thats why ive got a chip on my shoulder now
382648 i know the game i want to compete i want to be good

382794 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
382795 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
382796 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
382797 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
382798 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
382799 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
382800 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
382801 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
382802 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
382803 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
382804 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
382805 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
382806 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
382807 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
382808 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
382809 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
382810 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
382811 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
382812 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
382813 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
382814 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
382815 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
382816 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
382817 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
382818 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
382819 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
382820 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
382821 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
382822 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
382823 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
382824 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
382825 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
382826 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
382827 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
382828 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
382829 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
382830 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
382831 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
382832 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
382833 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
382834 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change

382846 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
382847 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important
382848 readers uninterested in that aggregation of content will still be able to use our regular home page
382849 time inc has complete editorial control over all of its 120 magazines and 40 websites
382850 as such it was one of those small events that may well mark a watershed toward a truly cross platform world with professionally produced content playing wherever the audience wants to see it and breaking down the wall of tv network vs

382858 clearly one other possible explanation is that hillary is off sulking or busy raising money to pay off debts and just lied about helping obama
382859 the only explanation that makes sense in terms of a realistic assessment of the parties past actions and behaviors rather than hope bong induced delusions is that obama has not asked the clintons to campaign for him
382860 t he candidates wife made it clear she was here to court the new supporters
382861 he would not accept accept a vice presidential offer from obama by lisab at no quarter

382863 herbert 7 28 08 ill say this about senator obama
382864 it was one of those rare newshour moments when you could tell something had gone wrong with this normally polite and even handed program just by observing the facial expressions of barack obama adviser lawrence korb in particular and moderator margaret warner at the end of it
382865 was allowed to attack and distort mr obamas position and then allowed to continue his argument
382866 abrams 7 28 08 a new nonpartisan study finds that the press is right tougher on barack obama than on john mccain
382867 cox 7 28 08 the authors of the study admit that most on air statements during that time could not be classified as positive or negative and that in fact found less than two opinion statements per night on the candidates on all three networks combined
382868 i have a job to do and i always tell young people do the job thats in front of you

382879 some doha skeptics about the necessity of a global agreement
382880 the decision to close followed the direction of our clients the editors of our papers
382881 they felt they could not afford to pay for a central washington bureau at a time when they were steering all available resources to local coverage back at home
382882 we have a whole generation thats trained to expect to be able to voice their opinion not just to read the news but to talk about it or share it and that may be ugly or it may be really provocative but i want to hear it i really believe if youre a newspaper online and you dont allow this youre not really online youve got to invest in this and really think about it and not just shut off the pipeline
382883 the idea of listening to readers gripe about the newspaper day in and day out still doesnt sound like a dream job nevertheless between the occasional conversations that deteriorated into name calling the past six years of thousands of phone calls and e mails have been fascinating largely because the courant has such devoted readers
382884 for the first time in its history theyre going to have a magazine that is going to make money
382885 when a newspaper is bleeding and you have something that will lift the newspaper immediately why not
382886 had always been produced by the newsroom not a magazine staff magazine people do magazines it takes a very different sensibility to be a magazine editor
382887 we now have 932 members people who have decided to support financially the nonprofit journalism that minnpost com provides
382888 but even thats a long shot considering that the few newspapers on the block arent attracting offers
382889 clintons relatively minimal public campaign role to date has been noticeable
382890 todays news makes that job of balancing the budget harder but should not change our resolve to make the tough decisions and the genuine effort to reach across the aisle

382966 it is this imbedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
382967 terrorism in our region feed on a residual tradition of narrow minded politics and of pursuing out moded geo political interest
382968 in a region prone to many challenges terrorism may well prove to be the most destabilizing

382990 the rotation policy is very important to keep the props going and for our next match werner will start and rayno gerber will be used in the second half as an impact player props need to play on a regular basis and that is why they will be rotated quite frequently

382992 we have two big games away so face a massive fortnight ahead
382993 the griquas contest is going to be tough the challenge for us is to lift ourselves in a place like kimberley against a side that has proven to be a thorn in the side of a few teams
382994 i did not want the match to turn into a dollie versus wp affair
382995 ill do whatever the coach wants and whatever is best for the team
382996 the camp is an opportunity for the coaching staff to work with the players and set some foundations ahead of what is going to be an important november for us
382997 we have a new blend of experience in the coaching staff and we felt that this camp would be key to getting the ideas of both the staff and players across ahead of the new season

383012 why is almost every robust healty boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a seperate deity and make him the own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all
383013 yes there is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot

383028 i liked the old aquaman he had confidence which could only stem from knowing he belonged to another world the others didnt know well because didnt he always have to ride in wonder womans plane when they went anywhere the new aquaman is a brute too obvious
383029 your ruminations on aquaman got me thinking first im thinking that im not sufficiently familiar with the character in either his original or renewed iterations to discuss him intelligently then im thinking thats never stopped me before and so
383030 superman is from a world thats entirely alien to every terrestrial being and is equally comfortable under water on land in the air or powering through a mountain like buckaroo banzai if he so wishes
383031 aquaman is a king and with that status goes a noblesse oblige an aristocratic self separation from a society which depends on his guidance and support but in which he cannot fully immerse himself if i may be allowed the figure of speech

383054 this is a result of desperate measures by most of the developers and second stakes are very high as most of the projects are not being sold developers have gone aggressive with an increase of 20 35 in the advertising budget due to inflation
383055 we have increased our advertising budget by another 20 due to recession in the market as well our stakes are high at the moment but things are going to get right in the next two three months
383056 its a do or die situation out there due to high recession in the market many developers are buying back their projects and reselling it is necessary to make a noise at this time to keep the projects on high visibility radar for those who actively trade on the real estate out of this increased budget the print media is taking up the major chunk while the rest goes to the outdoors out of a scale of 10 together advertising in print and outdoor could be rated as seven
383057 there has been a minor moderation because of liquidity crunch and many internal and external expenses have been re budgeted but i dont think the overall indications would be visible on an annual basis
383058 we have increased our promotional budget and see no reason why we should cut costs here moreover in companies such as ours the ability to fight recession is inbuilt
383059 developers are spending reasonably well in advertising to remain visible in the market those who are willing to spend are the biggies who have the stamina to spend more and make their presence felt when the market is down
383060 there has been no decrease in the advertising spends of the real estate companies rather there is an increase which is obvious from the number of ads they come up with on a daily basis in the print media i think it would take the next two quarters to understand how has this been effected

383119 ive read literature about feral children as an undergrad but nothing recent
383120 i would like to know where the authorities have been
383121 were going to do everything we possibly can do to make the transition smooth
383122 in order to change this system its going to take some hard work and its going to take some time
383123 i had to show him what water was all about
383124 he could fall in the pool and im not there
383125 i know a lot of us dont swim because they look at it like golf or tennis as a white sport
383126 part of the civil rights movement was based on the exclusion of blacks at public pools and public beaches
383127 my vision is to see this sport become as diverse as our country
383128 beyond that i also want parents to recognize the need to educate their children on water safety its not a matter of if their child will find themselves in a body of water its when
383129 if they have a fear theyre going to instill that in their kids
383130 im always willing to help because im looking at it as giving back that life saving skill
383131 you will teach your child to swim or they will drown
383132 i was thinking this was going to be a mess
383133 this is a good time to do it that 7 percent adds up
383134 i saw the trees coming and i saw a really big pine tree and i was hoping it wouldnt hit the drivers side seat
383135 were always glad to see more people wearing seat belts
383136 i never expected something like this to happen to me
383137 its difficult for people to pay all of their bills and eventually it gets to the point where they cant keep up
383138 people are being forced into some difficult choices and its just getting worse
383139 its basically flat compared to last year we havent seen a spike like other businesses have
383140 we dont really know the impact yet of the economic issues that everyone is dealing with
383141 we will work with people on payment arrangements its difficult for people to pick up the phone and call sometimes
383142 in terms of people paying their bills its actually getting better
383143 we are finding that people are promo shopping a lot more
383144 being no 1 in the coaches preseason poll does have significance since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
383145 but the postseason poll is the one that is the most important however i know the ranking is exciting for georgia football and hopefully we can do our part to stay in the race
383146 its an honor to play football for north augusta i hope they can see that

383150 if david is so interested in the domestic agenda and attacking the tories then this is the perfect job for him
383151 signs are emerging of a backlash among mainstream labour mps against david milibands decision to stake his claim to become leader amid fears that his move could hasten a general election before the first signs of an economic recovery
383152 its no secret i think there should be an evolution in favour of democratic accountability between police chiefs and the directly elected mayor
383153 beneath the tories confident exterior there is an intense debate about whether they should declare more of their hand in an attempt to drive a stake through labours heart while the party is on the floor

383155 the government has already with lax fiscal policy undermined its credibility investors and business are unlikely to feel that a windfall tax would indeed be an exceptional measure it would be seen as simply a tax grab on an industry that happens to be doing well because its profits are highly cyclical a windfall tax is bad economic management but more serious for labour it is politics of a time that has gone
383156 the doha round didnt die this week in geneva it died five years ago in cancun when certain ministers determined that the negotiations would be more valuable as a stage to dazzle domestic audiences than as a means to an agreement this week finally provided that clarity
383157 it has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the quran about human development it is clear to me that these statements must have come to muhammad from god because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later this proves to me that muhammad must have been a messenger of god
383158 does this mean that you believe that the quran is the word of god
383159 because the staging of human embryos is complex owing to the continuous process of change during development it is proposed that a new system of classification could be developed using the terms mentioned in the quran and

383164 verwacht mag worden dat een autoriteit als de vwa een degelijk handhavingsbeleid ook deskundig en consequent uitvoert
383165 we ontvangen steeds meer klachten van winkeliers dat er zonder deskundigheid maar wat wordt aangerommeld
383166 de testopstelling van de vwa stond nog in de doos terwijl er al wel twee soorten onderzoeksresultaten en adviezen aan de kledingbranche werden verspreid
383167 het is frustrerend als achteraf blijkt dat de vwa een verkeerde inschatting heeft gemaakt
383168 vaak wordt pas na eindeloze discussies en soms zelfs hoorzittingen door de vwa toegegeven dat er eigenlijk helemaal geen reden was om in te grijpen
383169 als er klachten zijn van winkeliers over een afgekeurd product dan kunnen ze altijd naar de commissie van beroep stappen om de beslissing aan te vechten

383179 we had bought up a rather large magazine collection just last week it had mostly your usual rock scene grooves and old circus magazines fairly good collectibles but nothing prepared us for what we found in the last box we opened inside was an incredible cache of the most beautiful quality marvel comics from the 70s that we had ever seen
383180 we graded and put each in protective covers most of which are in near perfect condition were really proud to be able to offer such fine pieces for sale on our website

383187 smile at yourself in the mirror because you know no one else will be smiling at you
383188 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online gaming industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
383189 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online gaming industry demonstrate to the general public
383190 i know the academy of online gaming design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
383191 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
383192 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online gaming award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online gaming project
383193 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our online gaming industry can benefit from this special night
383194 a number of credible online gaming authorities exist but none like that of wolle aceves who year after year organizes the annual online gaming awards and achievement night
383195 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
383196 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
383197 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
383198 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
383199 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
383200 the number one reason people are so far into debt is they dont know where the money is going
383201 when we got married we walked around with a pad for a month and wrote down everything we spent after that we used a cash system we pulled 200 a week out of the atm and left it in jar in our apartment its so much harder to spend the green stuff than swiping a piece of plastic through a machine
383202 its not the huge purchases its everyday occurrences they dont think twice about eating lunch out every day going to the movies every week or getting overdraft charges because they dont balance their checkbooks
383203 sometime around 2000 i decided it was time to think about hanging up my career i made plans by reading investment books talking to money wise friends and professionals and attending retirement classes today my philosophy is pretty simple low cost diversified index funds rebalanced every two years
383204 we worked four years on one salary and put as much of her salary away as we could
383205 we never got used to that second salary so the loss of her income doesnt affect us as much
383206 our first goal was to own a home outright in fifteen years and in seven years we did you have a lot more freedom to stamp your foot and say this is how it shall be if you own the land youre stamping your foot on
383207 we wiped our savings clean because didnt want to incur debt
383208 our rule is if you want it badly enough to save for it its probably worth having
383209 with my wife working we had structured our expenses to live on the lesser of the two salaries
383210 i could have bought a bigger house and better car but i didnt as a result we didnt lose our house auto or incur debt from the ordeal
383211 i remember guys who were fifty five years old coming out of mcdonalds at shift changes
383212 you cant live paycheck to paycheck you cant do that to yourself i dont have as much as i would like but i do sleep well at night regarding finances
383213 i probably sent out thousands of resumes i lost count
383214 im ex military and sometimes you have to make sacrifices
383215 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
383216 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support
383217 it is this imbedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
383218 terrorism in our region feed on a residual tradition of narrow minded politics and of pursuing out moded geo political interest
383219 in a region prone to many challenges terrorism may well prove to be the most destabilising
383220 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region
383221 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
383222 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
383223 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
383224 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
383225 when you do have individuals that pay for obvious reasons it has much more of a deterrent effect where its not being covered by the company insurance
383226 represents a major step forward in closing this chapter of the companys history
383227 the value of public pension funds allowing people to maintain these kinds of actions to correct corporate wrongdoing

383231 in todays world of cutthroat competition customers are eagerly looking forward to an enhanced experience in a cost effective way while improving customer experience is significant it is also important to analyze the cost therefore we need to deploy effective technologies that empower agents to deliver superior customer experience
383232 the important part is to find ways to improve productivity of the agent in terms of providing them intelligent voice assistance capabilities so that an agent can offer better customer experience without any hurdle
383233 the bpo sector has created a vast scope of growth opportunities in the past outsourcing in any manner requires a thinking process but it makes sense because of the cost advantage and flexibility factor
383234 i started thinking now is the right time for them and for me
383235 this is a huge opportunity and it is the right time to push that forward
383236 the linux desktop is something people have wanted for a long time and now its really happening
383237 theres a good chance your cell phone is running linux you dont really care but it is running linux thats a huge volume of users and theyre giving feedback on this end user platform
383238 you have huge volumes of these things shipping and people are getting linux they didnt get it because theyre huge believers in open source they got it because it works well thats a tipping point we can build on
383239 a lot of people have been joking about me being the top dog or big boss so i thought id point out that i work for the board of directors 7 volunteer part time directors who are doing a great job of running the gnome foundation my job is to make them and the gnome foundation even more successful
383240 when i first started working i had a boss who said stormy what can i do for you and ive stuck with that every since a managers role is to help people by working for them or with them to get things done these people are working on gnome because theyre passionate about that and im working for them
383241 trust people to do the right thing trust them to have good ideas to want to make the project organization team or company successful trust them they want to do good empower them make sure they know you trust and believe in them and give them what they need to execute on their great ideas maybe its a computer or a person to bounce ideas off of or help convincing others or some space or fun people to work with or a better understanding of what the company is trying to do
383242 its much more that i have to make my own business cards
383243 ive known for a long time that developers like open source software at hewlett packard i got lots of calls from developers who were excited about what they were doing and wanted to open source what they were doing developers just like open source because it works well they get to interact they get recognition at and said they consciously chose open source because it helps them retain developers i think youre starting to see more companies doing that ive talked to a lot of companies that are nobody i can quote for you though
383244 the default desktop for many linux distributions is gnome and a lot of people are using linux on the desktop i recently read a survey that said 46 of all enterprise users use openoffice org thats a good sign that the linux desktop is being used by a huge percentage of enterprise users
383245 at everyone wanted to say hi and show me what theyre working on i met with several hundred people its so much fun to be involved in the community and showing the world im part of the community im excited to be working with sponsors and get enterprises using gnome and helping to build those relationships i get energy from interacting with other people i enjoy talking to people and seeing their excitement
383246 compared to all the wireless technologies wi fi offers the best price performance in the indian context earlier only laptops had wi fi capability and now we have pdas mobile phones with wi fi and ultra mobile computers that would certainly fuel the need and the demand for wi fi hotspots wi fi with wired internet backhaul offers the best price performance for both service providers and customers
383247 it is not only the indian enterprises but even the indian retail segment that is looking up to wi fi as a viable networking option the technology is an ideal solution for indian businesses not only as an indoor wlan but also a mesh based outdoor broadband connectivity catering to small business applications
383248 the uptake of wi fi in the enterprise segment drives more data usage as workers have more access to critical applications throughout the day which drives the need for bandwidth to enterprise
383249 in wireless connectivity the quality of service remains an issue all stakeholders need to work together to provide consistent high quality service to end consumers
383250 uptake of wi fi in the enterprise segment drives more data usage as workers have more access to critical applications throughout the day this drives the need for bandwidth
383251 it is not only indian enterprises but also the indian retail segment that is looking at wi fi as a viable networking option
383252 it is really unsatisfactory that government and cellular companies are mesmerized with the 3g technology only with the rapid increase in adoption of laptops and notebooks wi fi will be the technology to provide cheap and reliable connectivity compared to others
383253 although the presence of wireless deployments are increasing in a remarkable way the government needs to clarify the bottlenecks that have arisen such as rationalization of tariffs de licensing of 2 4 ghz devices to be restricted to 100 milliwatts of radiated power output and effective policies for public hotspots
383254 in wireless connectivity the quality of service remains an issue with frequent breakdowns all stakeholders need to work together to provide a consistent high quality service to end consumers
383255 wi fi security standards like wpa2 wpa eap and aes have made good progress during the past several years and it is now possible to attain and maintain a strong wlan defense however vulnerabilities will continue to occur
383256 all wireless technologies have a different role to play in the indian environment and comparing them like apple to apple will not be very fruitful for the indian broadband picture
383257 wi fi security standards like wpa2 wpa eap and aes have made good progress during the past several years and it is now possible to attain and maintain a strong wireless lan wlan defense however vulnerabilities will continue to occur
383258 through 2010 90 of wlan security incidents will be a result of misconfigured systems
383259 wireless networks are the best possible medium for hackers to get an easy ingress into secure enterprise networks one needs to implement robust security mechanisms beyond default settings of access points to secure the network
383260 the continuous efforts of monitoring and user education are main drivers for the success of wireless technologies such as wi fi
383261 wi fi offers a great potential to indian enterprises where providing a fiber to every building is not feasible however lack of education and understanding the technology act as major roadblocks in its deployment
383262 however all wireless technologies have a different role to play in the indian environment and comparing them like apple to apple will not be very fruitful for the indian broadband picture

383267 following government regulation in 2003 network tasman reduced its residential and small business fixed charges to a third of their previous level and made good the revenue loss by increasing its charges for usage
383268 currently from the 32 fixed charge appearing on monthly residential power bills only 5 can be attributable to network tasman the remaining 23 is levied by the electricity retailer
383269 fixed line charges account for just 11 percent of the revenue network tasman derives from residential consumers the other 89 percent comes from charges based on usage network tasman consumers now face line charges that closely reflect usage
383270 for example a 10 000kwh a year consumer pays 84 percent more than a 5000kwh consumer
383271 this might not theoretically be the best method of charging for infrastructural assets but its the direction regulation has taken over recent years
383272 critics will likely say its a case of authorities overreacting to a case of over the top look at me comedy but the trashman videos in which dunn wears masks to disguise his identity and rants in a humorless tone dont look like they were made to make people laugh
383273 we are in trouble if the government is going to randomly jump on every idiot on the internet
383274 maybe we havent caught bin laden because he doesnt use youtube
383275 we took around 30 per cent of the market in the quarter which is pretty good and were still number one
383276 it is a very competitive market probably the most keenly contested in the world which is great for consumers and a lot of companies are losing customers
383277 i saw a clip of the show and i went oh my god i want to do that and ive been working really hard ever since
383278 usually its the wives or the girlfriends that call about classes and now its the husbands and boyfriends
383279 gentlemen see its ok to dance they see the sports figures dancing so they see its ok
383280 whatever is mainstream is always going to be whatever people are watching and paying attention to and as a business owner were just trying to capitalize on that in the industry
383281 i look at their tango and sometimes its fun to say ooh thats what they were doing
383282 i think that people you know you get the impression from the little story of how the amateurs learned to dance in a week that you can learn to do it
383283 i think there are a lot of people who dont really realize exactly how much work it is to learn to do it because tv performers are doing it six or seven hours a day for the show and we all have jobs
383284 members of the community are invited to come out and bring supplies to fill the cub bus
383285 we saw a need for the community to support the school and its students many of whom cant afford some of the supplies necessary to help further their education and we wanted to help our incredibly community spirited employees have spearheaded this project and we thank them for their dedication to improving local schools in this way

383303 pensavi di fare rumore e invece alcuni nemmeno ti pubblicano piu max la tua inchiesta sui periodici italiani allestero non piace a molti
383304 max devi renderti conto che gli sprechi colossali che riferisci accadevano con il silenzio assenzo degli italiani in italia che non vogliono stare a sentire a noi italiani di fuori e che pensano di liquidarci con qualche centesimo il problema e che anche quello va ai soliti noti e a noi non arriva niente gli italiani all estero che ricevono

383382 according to the pentateuchal legislation contained in leviticus a jubilee year is the year that follows immediately seven successive sabbatic years the sabbatic year being the seventh year of a seven year cycle accordingly the jubilee year takes place at the end of seven times seven years i e at the end of every forty nine years or the fiftieth hence the institution of the jubilee year system is but an extension or the working out of the sabbatic year legislation viz that as at the end of every six years there succeeds a sabbatic year so at the end of each seven sabbatic years there succeeds a jubilee year arguing from the analogous pentecostal system it is evident that the actual year in which the jubilee occurs is not the last of the seventh sabbatic cycle i e the forty ninth year but the year following namely the fiftieth hence at the end of each forty eight years there occur two consecutive fallow years viz the forty ninth or the sabbatic year of the seventh sabbatic cycle and the fiftieth or the jubilee year

383385 true jews are the people of the messiah apostle paul says the same thing very clearly for he is not a real jew who is one outwardly nor is true circumcision something external and physical he is a jew who is one inwardly and real circumcision is a matter of the heart spiritual and not literal rom 2 28 29 that this judaism of the heart is not to be limited to believing jews but includes believing gentiles is clear from pauls words to the philippians for we are the true circumcision who worship god in spirit and glory in christ jesus phil 3 3 we must conclude then that john makes a real distinction between literal israel the jews and spiritual israel the church

383420 sometimes an affair can be the best way for the person who has been unfaithful to get the information and impetus to change
383421 im not encouraging affairs but underlying the complicated mess is a kind of deep and delicate wisdom its an insight that something isnt working and needs to change
383422 these people are suffering terribly and need to be relieved of their sense of guilt and shame because those emotions are paralysing
383423 if handled right an affair can be therapeutic give clarity and jolt people from their inertia
383424 you could think of it as a radical but necessary medical procedure if your marriage is in cardiac arrest an affair can be a defibrillator
383425 this is the one area in which the truth usually creates far more damage in the long run
383426 if you care that much about honesty figure out who you want to be with commit to that relationship and devote the rest of your life to making it the most honest relationship you can
383427 we mustnt underestimate the immediate grief caused by an affair
383428 the last thing people want to hear if their partner has had an affair is any sympathy offered to the person who they feel has betrayed them and acted like a snake in the grass
383429 however when they look back in five or ten years they might take a different view
383430 maybe this book goes too far but we do need to take a sociological view of affairs to think what are we going to do about them rather than to say it cant happen when it clearly does

383476 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
383477 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
383478 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
383479 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
383480 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
383481 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
383482 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
383483 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
383484 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
383485 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
383486 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

383490 my mom and dad didnt push me to play basketball for their own purposes or anything like that i played because i wanted to
383491 our summer training consisted of playing basketball at the high school from 6 p m until 8 30 at night sunday through thursday
383492 on sundays there would be 40 kids there from all over the area
383493 we played outside the school because there was no such thing as an
383494 while i improved in my junior year at ravenna i grew from 5 10 to around 6 2 so i had some difficulty walking and dribbling while i was still growing into my body
383495 during my senior year my skills and timing on the court improved along side my frame
383496 particularly one who was destined to be one of the all time greats of the college coaching ranks
383497 one day in my senior year coach knight ended up at my house and it was me my dad my mom and coach knight
383498 he was really one of the most fascinating people youll ever meet hes articulate motivated and he wants you to be successful it was amazing
383499 you get to west point and everything is double time which is one thing i didnt have a problem doing
383500 i could run forever back then but i had this recurring chest pain after getting it looked at army doctors told me i had a collapsed lung and i could no longer be an officer
383501 a division iii program as a potential platform for carnes college career
383502 that said there is a reason why everything happens and i have never regretted going to ohio wesleyan
383503 i met some great people had a great education and i wouldnt trade my experience for anything
383504 i am really proud of my four years as the head coach of ravennas girls team
383505 on my book shelf in my office i have four photos of 10 girls who are all college graduates and successful women in their own right being able to be a part of that means a lot of me
383506 some of them were recalled in july and well see where were at in august
383507 we try to tell them early so they have an opportunity to get another job
383508 weve called back a lot of our people but not all
383509 our money comes from the district i cant employ people if i dont have the money to pay them
383510 this is not strictly a building issue this is our survival
383511 we have to have this levy to survive this is the big one
383512 the recommendation from the architect to the board was to build new because of structural and other issues
383513 you have to have a vision for the future the worst thing i can do to the residents of this township is to build for today and come back in five years and tell them i need more
383514 back in 1971 they had a vision for the future and its lasted us for 38 years we have to do the same thing now theres got to be a vision the board can embrace and support
383515 while officers were there what was believed to be a meth lab was discovered and the portage county drug task force responded
383516 its very scary to know this was going on right across the street
383517 we thought it must have been serious because of all the fire trucks
383518 it was always so quiet over there i never noticed anything going on
383519 its not as complicated a process as one might think
383520 unfortunately the recipes for making meth labs are on the internet and its not hard for people in the drug world to become involved in this
383521 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
383522 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
383523 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
383524 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter
383525 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
383526 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
383527 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
383528 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before
383529 they proved it this was just a practice i cant wait until we get to the games
383530 even though d a gave my kids a ball im not sold on him
383531 a badly thrown ball picked off near the end zone by cornerback eric wright
383532 its not that i dont like d a i just dont think hes consistent enough

383537 zhi you su tor lei su tor lei shi wo men wei yi ge xi wang
383538 either they were turned into stone or they turned themselves into stone
383539 the candle was simply narrating the story that was being drawn before us all we know is that the seven warriors were celestial bodyguards of the royal palace in ancient china from what i know so powerful and noble were the bodyguards that they were rumoured to have been descendents of heavenly beings
383540 was the king so cruel as to have had so many enemies
383541 no ambrose the warriors werent the kings bodyguards i doubt any human could have held such fierce loyalty from them they were protecting more than that
383542 the pearl of the orient its history is largely unknown but it is described to have been a jewel that held immense power naturally it attracted a lot of attention
383543 so it was stolen when the warriors were turned into stone
383544 i doubt it if it had been taken wed not be here today
383545 the pearl of the orient disappeared along with the seven stones if im not mistaken the only spell powerful enough to keep it hidden so well for so long is the imperial dragon cover but even that has a time limit
383546 and its been precisely one thousand years since the pearls disappearance the spell is about to be lifted
383547 well we knew this day would come in our lifetime if only the lights would come on again i want to make a cup of bubble tea
383548 this wasnt any ordinary blackout ambrose no candle would have lighted except for the crimson one we just used its a sign darkness is once again roaming in search for the jewel
383549 im getting to old for this anyway rose i suppose the biggest question is how in hezekiah jehosaphats name do you propose to do now i suppose the race is on to find the darned jewel
383550 thats why you were placed here with me ambrose although why you were chosen is beyond me
383551 the candle gave the name of the one who will search for the warriors and the pearl soturi
383552 and i believe were about to get that persons picture
383553 interesting eyes shes got but i suppose youre the expert on those ambrose
383554 i havent seen those anywhere in the last couple of centuries and if im not mistaken theyre not purely atheaphmin either theyve got a touch of zeupoi that makes her one of a kind shell be able to see things i myself probably wont be able to see that is given that shes trained properly
383555 even i can see that those windows into the soul never lie but thats all it is potential no promises only hope
383556 yes thats soturi you must find her ambrose only you will be able to recognize her eyes in the human world those eyes will be regarded as pretty but nothing more
383557 i know what humans perceive you seem to have forgotten that i used to be a human

383593 sono emozionato ha dichiarato al pacino allidea di rappresentare lactors studio nel vostro meraviglioso festival di roma vi siamo profondamente grati per aver tributato un ulteriore omaggio alla nostra istituzione cui avete meritoriamente dedicato tre anni di proiezioni e di approfondimenti condividendo con noi una parte di quei 60 anni di grandi film cui ci siamo dedicati attivamente con il nostro lavoro
383594 non poteva esserci unoccasione migliore per completare quella straordinaria collaborazione fra il festival di roma e lactors studio che consistita in una retrospettiva di quasi 30 film in due seguitissimi laboratori e in numerosi incontri con interpreti quali e altri salutati tutti con ampio successo non solo fra gli addetti ai lavori
383595 we still have to win ballgames im going to give him time
383596 i talked to him about hitting third about what i required a third hitter to do he has batted third most of his life and now well see we talked about the more accomplished hitter he could become like carlos lee to drive in runs and just an outstanding hitter like lance berkman
383597 ive hit two games no 3 in the big leagues but no matter what it is where im used to hitting
383598 im ready for everything thats coming it is going to be different now that kens gone its a new era he was the franchise since 2000 and now hes gone and were starting a new time with the reds and im ready for that
383599 im more comfortable in center than right but the plan from the beginning was for me to play right and i welcome that
383600 in this game you can have everything going great and in a matter of five or six pitches it just kind of flip flops on you
383601 its frustrating you have to stay focused especially against a team like this
383602 i like what im doing with the baseball right now
383603 im hoping i can just keep building off that the good breaks the good luck itll happen
383604 it was fun for me personally to have a chance to make field goals in big games
383605 ive made a lot of field goals around here but they havent necessarily been in big games to be able to experience that was very gratifying
383606 but more important than that was to see how much fun the team was having and the way the team would come together to play in big games to start winning and see the way the city and fans got excited thats what ill remember the most
383607 its a tough business when you dont win football games
383608 it was rough around here for a number of years
383609 we did a lot of good things last year and there are a lot of reasons to have confidence but we didnt make the playoffs it wasnt good enough it was fun to be a part of but i dont think any of us are satisfied

383651 met de kennis van vkb kunnen we de internationale detailhandel bedienen
383652 door de beslissing jaren geleden om te stoppen met de export van delfts blauw en in te zetten op toerisme heeft royal delft zowel naamsbekendheid als allure verloren
383653 het bedrijf had eerst nog diverse juwelierszaken over de hele wereld tot in jakarta
383654 in die tijd had het bedrijf nog duizenden mensen in dienst
383655 nu werken er in nederland nog maar zon tachtig mensen voor vkb
383656 door het samengaan met royal delft wordt een belangrijke volgende stap gezet voor vkb en haar werknemers de onderneming is klaar voor de volgende expansiefase onder de vlag van royal delft waarmee ook de cultuurhistorische waarde van vkb uitstekend is gewaarborgd
383657 de interpretatie laat ifrs een beetje over aan hoe conservatief de onderneming ermee omgaat
383658 maar in de regel geldt zes tot twaalf maanden als een langere periode en wordt een koersdaling van 20 tot 25 procent als significant gezien
383659 veel verzekeraars komen door de dalende aandelenmarkten onder druk te staan de kans bestaat dat daardoor meer afschrijvingen volgen
383660 ons doel is om een belangrijke lokale bank te worden het nederlandse banksysteem heeft een goede reputatie we zijn globaal we hebben een europese traditie maar willen ook een turkse bank zijn van de 6100 werknemers zijn er maar drie nederlanders
383661 dus ook voor ing allereerst om de demografie maar liefst 65 van de bevolking is jonger dan 35 jaar verder wordt de levensstandaard steeds hoger en is groeit de economie in 2012 zal turkije op de 17e plaats staan van de grootste economie n ter wereld
383662 ing heeft diverse activiteiten zoals de retailbank internetbankieren pensioenen en een investeringstak deze willen we allemaal ontwikkelen
383663 er zijn wel klanten weggegaan dat vinden we natuurlijk jammer we willen iedereen graag behouden en proberen daarom met andere banken te concurreren wat betreft producten dienstverlening
383664 het militaire aspect zal langzaam maar zeker verdwijnen de oyak bank betaalde de salarissen van de soldaten dat gaat over naar banken die in turkse handen zijn het pensioenfonds van de militairen blijft wel in onze handen
383665 tot 2001 waren er 81 turkse banken na de politieke crisis in 2001 die ontstond toen de toenmalige president sezer tijdens een topbijeenkomst de toenmalige premier ecevit keihard verweet niets tegen de corruptie te doen waren daar nog maar 51 van over oyak bank bleek wel een van de transparante ethische banken te zijn
383666 er zijn hier steeds meer mensen die steeds meer nodig hebben ing probeert aan die vraag te voldoen
383667 het is belangrijk dat de hervormingen worden doorgezet en dat het land zichzelf gaat zien als een deel van europa tussen nu en 2014 moet er nog veel gebeuren we moeten turkije op de goede weg helpen en aanmoedigen
383668 vrouwen in turkije zijn gelijkwaardig aan mannen ze hebben ook vaak leidinggevende posities hier en zullen nooit een stap terugdoen dat zullen ze nooit accepteren
383669 i want an autographed shirt but all i have is 15 do you take plastic

383780 it is not only a disgrace to him but also to his fans in tamil nadu if kannada organisations threatened to stall the release of my movie i would have happily compensated my producers from my pocket than apologise
383781 his statement only reveals his humane nature and his wish to ensure his fans in karnataka watch the movie

383795 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
383796 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990

383823 we want montana employers to understand that it is their responsibility to determine that the independent contactor ic has the proper documentation said carl kochman communications team leader at montana state fund
383824 if the ic fails to get the exemption or workers compensation insurance the employer may be held responsible for claims on injuries or occupational diseases and for payment of premium on their wages employers should keep evidence of the ic exemption or a certificate with their records to insure they are not charged premium for the independent contractor
383825 just because someone works for other employers doesnt mean they are independent contractors when they work for you
383826 get your fat ass off the ground mckay im not carrying you all the way back to the gate
383827 colonel and youre right its not so much fat as ripe like the worlds most perfect peach the kind with that soft fuzz you can feel tickling against your tongue before you bite
383828 all right im up and walking see me walking towards the gate and for the record colonel no one will be left wondering about your stance on dont ask dont tell if you keep stumbling around composing sonnets about my ass
383829 i know youre dedicated to the pursuit of physical fitness colonel but there is no way were going to be able to hike anywhere in this heat
383830 not only do we not register on the life signs detector due to some sort of background interference theres always the ever present danger of sunstroke sunburn sun poisoning
383831 id say its not the heat its the humidity but were missing half of the equation
383832 relax rodney im not planning to re enact lawrence of arabia especially seeing as theres a distinct lack of camels
383833 remember horses they were the animals the cowboys rode in tombstone which is of course one of the colonels favorite movies since its filled with guns and death and mayhem and men coughing up lungs
383834 a camel is like a horse with a hump in the middle of its back where it stores fat its uniquely suited for deserts because it can go for long periods without food and water using its stored resources instead of eating anything that isnt nailed down
383835 yes well except for the fact that they dont have hooves their tails are shorter and skinnier and their necks are longer and they spit and
383836 fine next time you describe one after all explaining to teyla and ronon why a laden swallow is so amusing worked well for you a few weeks ago
383837 go sit down rodney so we can see if there are any sheiks with dancing girls waiting out there for us
383838 sure thats all we need ive always wanted to be staked out in the desert sun because a certain someone cant keep his hands off the harem
383839 we really shouldnt be walking out here in the middle of the day major it would be much more sensible to find some shelter and travel in the early morning and at dusk even the sunscreen i developed for myself cant cope with this level of uv exposure not to mention the increased risk of dehydration
383840 how many times do i have to tell you that its colonel you wouldnt have to worry so much about dehydration if youd just shut the fuck up mckay
383841 thats helpful isnt it i was trying to make the point that were more likely to actually reach the gate alive if we try to take better care of ourselves along the way you should drink something too no use letting yourself get too weak too soon and no nonsense about saving the water for me and ending up dying of thirst with a full canteen because i still have plenty left in my own canteens and youll probably end up having to go on ahead without me and youll need
383842 so im thinking that the only good thing about having a three person team this time out is that we dont have to divide the food and water between four
383843 no problem mckay if i get too hungry ill finally get to find out if you taste like chicken
383844 i changed my mind sheppard youre first on the menu
383845 thats the best i can do for now carson will fix you up a lot better when we get back
383846 and just how do you think thats going to happen colonel did i miss something vital when we were assessing the fact that were currently sitting powerless in the middle of the equivalent of an elephants graveyard except its the metal skeletons of wraith darts and miscellaneous other vehicles that are scattered over a radius of approximately one hundred miles of uncharted desert
383847 oh wait theres more any rescue team coming after us will either suffer the same fate or is going to miss us completely because we wont register on any detectors
383848 im going outside to find a place to set up some shade well boil if we stay inside here
383849 rodney youre awful quiet over there the heat getting to you
383850 now you want me to talk major what is it with you anyway i seem to recall that you told me to shut the fuck up not too long ago
383851 its colonel fuck you know what i dont care anymore rodney call me major or sheppard or hey what the hell go crazy and actually use john for once
383852 not very often rodney weve been through a lot together and still there you are ten feet away from me youd be even farther than that if it wouldnt move you out of the shade
383853 gotta love those whirling robot hands mckay but jeez your wrists really are limp arent they
383854 can we just go back to the bad metaphors using peaches that particular flight of fancy sounded a hell of lot less stereotypically homophobic better yet take a drink and then lets start walking toward the gate again after all ronons not going to magically heal himself and run ahead to save us the trip
383855 colonel its the only logical thing to do as much as im enjoying our sojourn in the bright and colorful pegasus version of the bermuda triangle the amenities leave much to be desired lets face it the search teams arent going to find us here theyre going to head in the direction of the original energy reading just like we did but they arent going to be tempted to take a side trip to explore the shiny place at the base of the mountains unlike a certain pilot who suddenly channeled a magpie
383856 the closer i get to the gate the better the chance ill have of being spotted from the air assuming anyone will be looking
383857 all right you win this is how were going to do it
383858 and its pretty too you know rodney im really not homophobic
383859 interesting segue there from celestial rainbows to declarations regarding sexual proclivities well thats very good to hear major that means therell be one less person ill need to avoid late at night when im walking the corridors alone on the way to my quarters
383860 considering what could happen if you youre pretty casual about
383861 yes maj john its never been a big secret that im bisexual i just dont make it a habit of shouting it on high god were friends youre probably the best friend ive ever had and after all our flirting and innuendo and teasing im honestly surprised that it surprises you weve come pretty damn close more than once and youre the one that keeps backing away in some sort of gay freakout about face
383862 relax john youre safe inside your military issue closet im not going to jump you when your guard is down i know youre not really interested in me that way despite all the evidence to the contrary just take another drink and put on more sunscreen so you arent courting skin cancer so diligently we still have a long way to go before were out of this mess
383863 youre wrong about me i am interested in you rodney i have been right from the beginning its just the damn rules my career in the air force i could lose my chance to fly if anyone
383864 sometimes you just have to ask yourself whether the potential reward is worth the gamble john your life cant always be settled by the toss of a coin
383865 you think i dont know what its like to take a chance i walked through the gate on earth knowing the odds were astronomically high that i might never come back hell im fully aware that when it comes down to it im a coward most of the time i also know that at least once i weighed the options and took a life altering risk oddly enough its turned out that walking through these gates following you into the unknown has gotten easier every time i do it
383866 damn it rodney i dont think youre a coward youve been there every time we needed you even when there was every reason to think you were going to end up hurt or worse thats one of the things i really admire about you considering im afraid to try something as simple as kissing someone i i dont know what im trying to say here except has it all been worth it
383867 we picked you up about ten miles short of the gate three quarters dead and hallucinating
383868 still pretty impressive the number of miles you traveled in that heat i have to admit that i never would have made it that far it ended up being a good plan having me stay behind at the jumper with ronon
383869 i did some extrapolation based on what wed been able to see before we crashed correlated that with the scatter patterns of the debris and then found the beams transmitter buried under an enormous cairn after i was able to shut it off
383870 you should see the walls of the jumper theyre covered with numbers mckay is weird
383871 i never did get to find out what he tastes like
383872 and thank you colonel for leaving me alone with this galaxys answer to hannibal lector i was sure i was going to wake up one morning and find myself garnished with fava beans
383873 its okay i do i thought about us out there and there were no coins involved
383874 so i was thinking of kidnapping a big russian woman named helga and breeding my half human spawn with her
383875 i ate all of the daedaluss chocolate shipments before they got here
383876 what get over here so i can eat your head
383877 but why are you here surely you have not come back
383878 even with weir gone im not sure i would want to stay what with mckay still in charge of science and him being a cthulhu worshipper and all
383879 you werent there miko the dreams that man has send him screaming praises to the great old ones in a half asleep stupor im telling you hes mad hes probably always been mad long before day one
383880 and embarrassing yourself you want to leave before someone else sees you acting like this
383881 zelenka you were always the most level headed of us all
383882 you of all people have to believe me mckay is a cthulhu cultist
383883 cthulhu is high priest on earth to great old ones this is not earth thus worship of cthulhu does not yield results here
383884 with no high priest to great old ones here to act as intermediary we need worship great old ones themselves
383885 against no one in particular but it fits an mo dr kavanagh came to me fearing for his mind because of what he called blatant cthulhu worship running rampant in the halls now before you laugh i point out that the man was both serious and scared out of his wits would you happen to have any idea what happened here
383886 these complaints started in some capacity two weeks ago on the daedalus you remember from dr kavanagh accusing you of being a cthulhu worshipper
383887 has anyone explained to him that great cthulhus power doesnt extend much further than planet earth and thus any worship of great cthulhu out here is going to be both useless and harmless
383888 that is radek and i explained to him that worship of great cthulhu doesnt work out here and that worship of yog sothoth is more practical
383889 and why did kavanagh need this to be explained to him
383890 kavanagh comes in here and starts accusing you of worshipping cthulhu
383891 and then when i dont immediately agree with him he accuses me of being brainwashed by you and in league with your dark powers then zelenka comes in and we explain things to kavanagh and he goes away
383892 this started two weeks ago after we picked up your jumper stranded you and sheppard were the only atlantis personnel inside and it was you mckay whom kavanagh immediately began rumors about explain that
383893 mckay has nightmares that frankly have some of the same qualities as night terrors such as screaming i was there when kavanagh started whispering mythos things into mckays ear while he slept in order to steer his dreams to certain shall we say cthulhu based topics the fact that mckay spent every night after screaming about cthulhu based topics has a defined cause
383894 right sorry for suspecting you mckay also you might want to sit up straight if you ever want to move your neck again
383895 i need some files from the department of defense or the state department or whoever it was who was involved in this
383896 the statute of limitations was up decades ago you can just file a freedom of information act request to get them
383897 the statute of limitations for the roswell crash was up ten years ago
383898 and yet project bluebook is still classified with all due respect sir a freedom of information act request is going to get me nowhere
383899 one of my men said i should look for these files
383900 something about his family being from innsmouth i reread lovecrafts version of events however i refuse to make any decision or judgment until after i see these files for myself
383901 and you dont want to tell me in case someone asks
383902 understandable but sheppard ive been in the air force longer than you it used to be fairly standard protocol to be briefed on some of the contents of these files they are disturbing
383903 in 1928 the fbi led the raids on innsmouth massachusetts
383904 men women and children were rounded up imprisoned executed and left to die because they were different and then not 15 years later we had the gall to act shocked when hitler did the same thing until 30 years ago there were standing orders to shoot on sight anyone suspected of having innsmouth blood i recommend not eating anything before reading the files i bring back
383905 was there an actual something or did you come by just to drag me out of hot water and perfect bubbles
383906 i put in a request for those files on the innsmouth raids
383907 look this is not something i am going to discuss in the corridor no matter how naked i am
383908 so either go away and never approach me about this again or get in here
383909 i told him i wanted the files but not why hes apparently seen them before he compared what the federal government did there to hitler
383910 those who raided innsmouth had orders to round up everyone in the town
383911 anyone who resisted was to be killed made an example of and of course people resisted men women children they were all shot for resisting those who didnt were rounded up like animals and sent to prisons camps the town was dynamited orders were disobeyed though thats the only reason i exist children young enough to look untainted were lost in orphanages where they would be safe at least thats the story i was told
383912 and i hate to sound the devils advocate but caldwells analogy is a bit off hitler targeted groups different only in religion or sexual preference we were much more different than that mankinds greatest fear has always been that of the unknown and to be frank you didnt get much more unknown than us in the 20s
383913 even if you change your mind after reading the files thank you for your understanding now
383914 i know what a deep one is i still dont care what they did was horrifying and i can see why youre scared of people finding out
383915 i should get you to purr more often if itll get you to shut up once in a while
383916 if youre going to be like that then im just going to get back to work
383917 i swear the best ideas flow underwater it works better when ive got zelenka in here with me and ideas can flow without needing words
383918 my bathtub has room for at least three want to come in
383919 and how in hell did you get a tub this huge its like a jacuzzi
383920 otherwise go away and let me work and get naked socks and underwear leave a funny feel to the water
383921 i dont think it matters to him what i am
383922 its getting harder and harder to hide and humans dont remain oblivious forever i prefer telling people as opposed to them finding out accidentally
383923 we were discussing using jumpers underwater for better survey of ocean floor and the underwater jumper bay was mentioned
383924 i remember we cannot use it because control room is flooded she asked why you could not operate controls
383925 miko asked why i couldnt operate the controls in a flooded room
383926 and yes just like that she was confused when i told her you could not she said later then when you had changed enough
383927 the aircraft landed safely and was inspected by the airport fire service and there was no action by leicestershire fire and rescue service
383928 the aircraft left east midlands after taking off it then came back in it landed safely
383929 we have now received mr ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital he arrived here by ambulance at 5am today following an air ambulance flight from antigua
383930 the medical and nursing hand over process between the clinical team which accompanied him here and the intensive care team at morriston has now taken place initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details

383932 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
383933 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
383934 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
383935 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
383936 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
383937 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
383938 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
383939 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

383945 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
383946 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support
383947 it is this imbedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
383948 terrorism in our region feed on a residual tradition of narrow minded politics and of pursuing out moded geo political interest
383949 in a region prone to many challenges terrorism may well prove to be the most destabilising
383950 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region
383951 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose

383959 we found your person now pay us a fee to see what we found
383960 may release criminal history information to agents of employers or persons with written consent of the person who is the subject of the record
383961 its to find the basic origins of the big bang and how matter was created or it might create loads of tiny black holes
383962 so what the big bang has already happened and were all here what a waste of money
383963 hey its not as good as frontline but you might as well watch anyway
383964 we dont want to oversell the product in case someone gets disappointed so lets try to limit the amount of people who watch it
383965 its a sleeper audiences are taking their time working out the show the word of mouth is strong
383966 our tv critics out of touch with the general public
383967 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
383968 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
383969 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
383970 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
383971 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
383972 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
383973 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
383974 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
383975 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
383976 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

383987 theres a time and a place for quickies and that kind of orgasm is great but i prefer drawn out fuck sessions beginning with oral sex and leading on to pussy and then butt sex
383988 a session like that will give me four five or more orgasms lucky arent i mind you were talking perhaps a couple of hours so the guy if hes in decent shape should be able to manage two or three orgasms of his own i fantasize about having two or three guys at once and getting myself fucked and climaxed to total exhaustion

383991 so i went out and bought hard again by muddy waters that was a big learning curve i listened to that album again and again and again james cotton was the harmonica player on that album

384007 partnership and co operation among nations is not a choice it is the only way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity that is why the greatest danger of all is to avoid new walls to divide us from one another the walls between the old allies on the either side of atlantic cannot stand the walls between the countries with the most and least cannot stand the walls between the races and tribes natives and immigrants christians muslims and jews cannot stand these are the walls we must tear down
384008 freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us i want to say on behalf of my countrymen who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic who are far distant from you that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you even from a distance the story of the last 18 years i know of no town no city that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of west berlin while the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the communist system for all the world to see we take no satisfaction in it for it is as your mayor has said an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity separating families dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters and dividing a people who wish to be joined together

384088 i nerazzurri e i red devils sono in pole position per vincere chelsea e roma subito dietro
384089 in pole position vedo il manchester united seguito sempre in prima fila dallinter di mourinho
384090 non bisogna snobbare nessuno ma le due italiane sono nettamente favorite sono state evitate alcune mine vaganti
384091 il tormentone ronaldo gli ha rovinato lestate i cento milioni del real sono sbalorditivi ma non tutto si pu comprare trovo giusto che un giocatore non sia autorizzato adavere sempre lultima parola ferguson una testa dura penso che ronaldo rester a manchester una scelta giusta dal punto di vista tecnico per il risultato del portogallo agli europei dimostra che neppure un ronaldo pu vincere da solo un grande torneo
384092 ronaldo tevez e rooney garantiscono un centinaio di reti io sono innamorato di rooney bello vederlo rincorrere il proprio difensore fino alla bandierina il prototipo del campione moderno
384093 tutti dal presidente moratti allultimo dei magazzinieri hanno un solo obiettivo in testa la champions
384094 lasciamo lavorare mourinho un grande allenatore linter dovr cercare di organizzarsi velocemente linfortunio di materazzi un brutto colpo in pi ci sono tanti interrogativi il ginocchio di ibra la fragilit di vieira i recuperi di cordoba e samuel mourinho pu vincere la champions se avr a disposizione i suoi giocatori pi importanti linter al completo fortissima
384095 solo abramovich poteva resistere a moratti peccato lampard uno dei quattro pi forti centrocampisti del mondo con pirlo de rossi e iniesta
384096 abramovich ha costruito una squadra di campioni trovo giusta la scelta di affidarla a uno esperto come scolari
384097 come pirlo uno che crea calcio e segna gol decisivi il chelsea ha un centrocampo spaventoso
384098 un bel colpo e attenti a walcott diventer un asso ha una velocit impressionante larsenal corre e ha qualit e ha investito su un grande talento quale il francese nasri
384099 credo che questanno gerrard e compagni dovranno spendersi un podi pi in campionato
384100 mi piace la scelta di guardiola in panchina barcellona vuol dire qualit possesso palla gioco corto il calcio di guardiola partito ronaldinho che per ancora un campione integro il barcellona doveva venderlo il milan ha fatto bene ad acquistarlo ronaldinho sar una delle stelle del nostro campionato
384101 largentino vincer presto il pallone doro un genio del calcio ma ci sono anche iniesta e la giovane punta bojan pu essere un altro messi
384102 schuster molto preoccupato ha detto che il real forse ha perso troppo tempo in questa trattativa potrebbe lasciare un segno negativo a livello psicologico ora pensano a van der vaart che non cristiano ronaldo ma il real ha grandi campioni da sergio ramos a van nistelrooy
384103 collaborazione per i prossimi due tre anni parlo di nazionale azzurra
384104 ormai la frattura era troppo profonda per pensare di ricomporla per resto convinto che cassano potesse reggere tecnicamente il real
384105 non lo perder di vista neppure per un secondo ha i colpi del campione
384106 ma se riesce a tenere benzema sar un rivale scomodo per tutti
384107 e con lentusiasmo di chi riconquista un torneo che considera casa propria e toni e gol sono la stessa parola e poi c klinsmann che ai mondiali come tecnico della germania stato bravissimo ma allenare un club tutta unaltra storia leggo che ha imposto metodi di lavoro curiosi quasi rivoluzionari i giocatori apprezzano sempre le novit a patto che poi arrivino le vittorie
384108 attenti allo zenit di san pietroburgo leggo che arshavin potrebbe trasferirsi al tottenham arshavin bravo ma non un campione comunque il calcio russo in grande crescita
384109 che insieme a gilardino former una delle coppie pi micidiali prandelli ha una bella macchina solida da corsa con alcuni giovani di grande futuro penso a esempio a montolivo la fiorentina sar una delle mine vaganti del torneo
384110 con mutu sarebbe stata perfetta ora capisco i dubbi di spalletti nellindividuare unalternativa al campione rumeno ma la roma resta comunque una delle squadre da finale di champions soprattutto se risolver velocemente il problema aquilani
384111 francesco un fenomeno nessuno al mondo riesce a guarire velocemente come lui e con il miglior totti la roma sale nel gruppo delle squadre da seconda fila insieme alla juve al barcellona al bayern monaco

384153 the justices were a little jumpy at us which i think is a remnant from medellin
384154 we proved in a lot of ways that cuba has total sovereignty
384155 i made the point that its not guantanamo theme park its guantanamo naval base
384156 the geneva convention was a big thing that we just snuck in at the end
384157 section 7 is unambiguous about whether states or people can invoke the geneva convention for habeas corpus
384158 it completely bans it it says right in the military commissions act that no one can invoke the geneva convention
384159 the most important point that i made was establishing beyond a doubt that the courts had jurisdiction over guantanamo detainees habeas claim
384160 almost the entirety of my opponents argument relied on excluding the courts jurisdiction
384161 by proving that the courts do have jurisdiction i feel that my opponents arguments were effectively nullified
384162 justice alito pointed out at the end that other countries do not provide habeas corpus to non citizens who are deemed a threat to their nation
384163 the purpose of detaining enemy combatants is not to keep them forever
384164 it is to prevent them from contacting the enemy and getting back on the battlefield
384165 there were a few difficult questions specifically from justice ginsburg and justice souter but overall i felt as though i was able to gain at least some support for my argument from many of the justices
384166 i dont think i could have done much more in the way of preparation but i still felt like i got tripped up a couple of times
384167 fortunately i was able to get in all of the main points that i was striving to include
384168 with any luck the supreme court would have absorbed those main points as i tried to strenuously focus on them and that that would help for my cases desired outcome
384169 we believe that it is considerably paramount that the supreme court rules in our favor because of two reasons
384170 the first is that in the interest of foreign relations the united states government should not fall back on treaties that are signed and binding the second is that this case would more finely establish jurisdictional lines in the area of foreign powers in the branches of the courts congress the executive and the state governments and authorities
384171 the strongest point in my argument is that this court has constantly affirmed the idea that the president is prohibited from making the laws
384172 i think texas has shown that the president did in fact try to unilaterally make policy here thereby making his actions unconstitutional
384173 it is important for the supreme court to rule in favor of texas because of the effect this could on future domestic affairs
384174 ruling in favor of the petitioner would grant the president a dangerous amount of unilateral authority the court must rule in favor of texas so as to check this unconstitutional act by the president and to prevent any more in the future

384178 who installed the equipment and who was responsible for maintaining it
384179 most people overlook the possibility of acquiring lyme disease or other tick and insect transmitted diseases
384180 certain areas here in new york however have among the highest incident rates of lyme disease in the united states
384181 some spots within the northeast are much riskier than others
384182 and weve developed specific hypotheses to explain why the new funding from epa will allow us to test these hypotheses in the field and the resulting knowledge should help inform habitat management to reduce human risk
384183 we made a big mistake five years ago when we allowed an important researcher at our firm to moonlight at naill bledsoe corporation
384184 the result was a catatrophe for our gaming in indonesia marketing efforts and ruined our numbers for the year
384185 this new gaming in indonesia product will revolutionize the way consumers live at home
384186 and furthermore with motil falcon incs golden guarantee warranty youre assured top quality reliable performance and help with any repairs
384187 weve still got a few tricks up our sleaves that will stun the industry so be on the look out for big things from nickl frankovich inc within the next few months
384188 with the pomp and circumstance of segee philpotts inc touting its new brand
384189 it only means good things for the gaming in indonesia market
384190 and our newspaper is ready to cover all angles good and bad so that our readers can be better informed consumers
384191 we hedged our bets on lafata settler incs release today and all indications point to big profits for our share holders
384192 i also think expanded european operations will help share holders pocket books as well there is less competition in europe among the various gaming in indonesia companies so higher prices can be charged team this with the strong euro and youve got instant profits
384193 but also want to assure the general public that the government will be looking out for their well being with consistent and independent gaming in indonesia product reviews and panels
384194 look everyone knows that slominski sonner inc contributed to our partys campaigns last year this is not news remember however that we have a duty to our constituents our voters to protect them from corporate malpractice and shoddy workmanship
384195 not since bredernitz mackseys book in 1995 have i seen such a quality explanation of gaming in indonesia fact fiction and direction
384196 luckily the key is not to remain untouched by prejudice but to consciously and deliberately rise above it at every opportunity
384197 the goal of the fat experience project is to map the global experience of fat in a way that is human has a face a heart a mind a body and a voice
384198 losing just 10 of body weight cures most of the symptoms
384199 its normal to have pressure after all these years i am used to it this is due to peoples expectations of me i hope i wont disappoint this time round
384200 we must hope for the best and put our support behind them as you know in any competition what happens on that day is what counts many many things come together the temperament of the athletes how the other athletes are doing
384201 this unprecedented show of support over such a short period of time shows that angelenos are coming together behind antonio villaraigosa
384202 who are these people that are supporting the sleeze bag mayor
384203 i think there are two very important things about this draw firstly the second game is at home which is really really important clearly that makes a massive difference to play the deciding game in front of our own fans
384204 im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
384205 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect we know some things about their team already but we will now watch more videos and get reports from our scouts before the first game
384206 of course we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent some time with newcastle axel witsel is a good young player and wilfried dalmat is probably the best player in their team alexandre da silva is a good defender as well so we know they wont be easy opposition for us
384207 overall though it is a good draw and we are happy
384208 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
384209 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
384210 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
384211 last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us so i know we have the players to score goals
384212 i am not about getting rid of thin models what i am about is diversifying our notion of beauty so that it is more inclusive because i feel at present there are so many people who suffer due to an unattainable beauty ideal
384213 lopez jimenez said the study shows that just because your weight may be normal for your size it doesnt mean you arent at risk for heart disease and diabetes
384214 even a small amount of extra fat where it matters most can wreak metabolic havoc increasing risk for diabetes and heart disease while leaving you with a body weight that looks perfectly innocent
384215 excess body fat in the belly is a menace whatever your weight this study should sensitize patients and providers alike to this concern
384216 one expert agrees that normal body weight is not synonymous with good health
384217 and therefore high body weight is not synonymous with poor health

384328 was the first time an integration of scoring technology of this type and scale had been used in america by usoda
384329 we added the weather radar to the scoring machines on the spot it seemed like the sensible thing to do the fact that we were able to protect the young racers from harm is obviously far more important in my mind than the technology of scoring the regatta
384330 this is the first time virtually anyone can afford to track their valuable assets and loved ones
384331 i trust my employees but i elected to enhance my fleet with millennium plus gps tracking isnt about doubting my employees its about running our business more efficiently and offering our customers the best service possible

384338 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
384339 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
384340 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
384341 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
384342 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
384343 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
384344 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
384345 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
384346 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
384347 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
384348 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
384349 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
384350 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
384351 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
384352 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
384353 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

384357 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
384358 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
384359 we liked him a lot because of his running his handle and his ability to post up and step outside we had him in for workouts twice i think the kings got a good player
384360 the one thing i didnt do was hit for average
384361 but that was considered pretty good for a power hitter
384362 they always talk about five tools and bobby had them all
384363 by the way if you could get me a seven figure contract thatd be pretty good too
384364 after 11 years you have to enjoy yourself and thats what i tell the rookies we have four of them and they are eager to learn
384365 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes to further division of the christian world
384366 such a practice contradicts centuries old church traditions dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops to be even more unacceptable
384367 special blessing to lead the people of god and a special responsibility to maintain the purity of the faith and be symbols and guarantors of the churchs unity
384368 in our view the decision of the general synod of the church of england
384369 not dictated by theological or practical church needs but by a tendency to follow the secular idea of sexual equality in all spheres of life
384370 the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
384371 we are satisfied with the works they have been executed as per the world bank award
384372 the project is now almost near completion and any adverse comment would have delayed its execution
384373 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur

384375 the letters are in ancient hebrew and are very clearly preserved
384376 it is not very often that such a discovery happens in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible
384377 burning tree will benefit greatly from the skills and abilities of an industry leader like mark

384389 vaughany said something very important to me just before i went out to bat and said dont be reckless but be aggressive and i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper
384390 i was going out there and trying to take the bowlers on which is how i play my best cricket and so it was nice to go out there and try to score from ball one
384391 i wasnt going to change my way from ball one i said i was going to go out there and be aggressive i wanted to go out there and give it a good go
384392 i just wanted to continue in that manner whether i was in the 90s or we were six down and really forget about the situation and just watch the ball and hit it and it worked for me
384393 i havent scored the runs so far in test cricket this year and i was under a lot of pressure
384394 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
384395 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
384396 it was decided that the entire u s relay team will be disqualified from the sydney games
384397 it forms part of a wider piece of work on the balco case
384398 one of the employees offered to show me a crashed aircraft he removed a board in the wall of the building and in the light of his torch i could just make out an old plane with spoke wheels and solid rubber tyres
384399 this was one of the most amazing sights i have ever seen the plane i was told was one of the first postal aircraft it had landed short of the runway and crashed the pilot was killed
384400 she showed me the remains of the aircraft inside the walls rumour was that the unfortunate pilot was still interred there
384401 the only thing i remember is seeing a wheel that rather looked like a bike wheel and a bit that i presumed was the fuselage the whole thing came about was because she had been telling me about ghostly incidents within bourjois and it was said that the pilot still haunted the vicinity
384402 it could not be moved because doing so would make the building unsafe
384403 the description of the aircraft which your gentleman saw suggests that it was an early aircraft from the 1920s
384404 the bourjois factory was very badly damaged by bombs in an attack by german aircraft in 1940 so if the mystery aircraft was hidden in the factory it is unlikely to have survived to be seen by someone a few years ago
384405 i am afraid we do not wish to communicate on the topic of the buried aircraft

384411 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
384412 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
384413 now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
384414 we had two tough games against odense and now we are determined to do as well as possible
384415 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
384416 the suspension of activities leaves more than 65 000 civilians the majority of them displaced people without medical assistance
384417 it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work

384435 this case traumatized the agency when it came out two years ago and it has been very alive since then
384436 not to diminish the case but the district attorneys report is using testimony about a time that isnt today

384450 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
384451 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
384452 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest

384458 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
384459 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common

384510 el lector nunca acaba de encontrarse c modo con los personajes de stevenson no puede librarse de la impresi n de saber muy poco de ellos

384512 this is a result of desperate measures by most of the developers and second stakes are very high as most of the projects are not being sold developers have gone aggressive with an increase of 20 35 in the advertising budget due to inflation
384513 we have increased our advertising budget by another 20 due to recession in the market as well our stakes are high at the moment but things are going to get right in the next two three months
384514 its a do or die situation out there due to high recession in the market many developers are buying back their projects and re selling it is necessary to make a noise at this time to keep the projects on high visibility radar for those who actively trade on the real estate the print media is taking up the major chunk while the rest goes to the outdoors out of a scale of 10 together advertising in print and outdoor could be rated as seven
384515 there has been a minor moderation because of liquidity crunch and many internal and external expenses have been re budgeted but i dont think the overall indications would be visible on an annual basis
384516 we have increased our promotional budget and see no reason why we should cut costs here moreover in companies such as ours the ability to fight recession is inbuilt
384517 we maintained our profit margins this quarter at 39 per cent in the face of cost and price pressures our financial position and strong liquidity along with our ability to control costs have placed us in a firm position
384518 the group has been growing between 40 per cent and 45 per cent since the last nine years and the performance during the quarter was in line with that

384541 snob value for the address was something that went with high prices rather than any other feature of the south mumbai premium home
384542 the benchmark if one wants to quantify the highest price level as being one has consistently risen with the last on record transaction being the one where movie star and bjp mp vinod khanna bought a residential apartment at malabar hill in the tony south mumbai area from citibank for rs 1 25 lakh a sq ft
384543 this followed a similar transaction some months back when a london based nri acquired a 3475 sq ft property in ncpa apartments at nariman point for rs 97 842 per sq ft
384544 a premium home to be so truly has to have more than just a high price and posh address
384545 it has to give the residents a lifestyle that complements the status of living in a premium address
384546 it does not make a project less premium if the address is lower parel nor does a project not truly premium become it is in worli
384547 there is no substitute for a well planned home constructed with the best of construction technology having the latest in luxurious amenities but a truly premium south mumbai home needs to also provide open spaces for the children sufficient car parking a safe and secure environment premium is what a buyer wants and gets in a south mumbai home just as he would have in any global city
384548 a premium home in south mumbai would need something more than just posh locations
384549 i can think of two projects by the orbit group villa orb and orbit arya which fit in this segment both are located at napean sea road and the amenities and features are mind blowing
384550 from a time when hiranandani gardens created a shift in premium residential locations from just being in tony locations in south mumbai to central suburbia the message has gone home and developers are coming up with these new homes that are spacious have the latest amenities and have vast open spaces
384551 in mumbais high end residential property context the definition of luxu ry is changing at a pace beyond contemplation
384552 some developers say they are creating a limited edition project some brand their project super luxurious and some say out right not for all by invitation only also location is not the only deciding factor it is coupled with a host of parameters ranging from size duplexes glass exteriors bath room fittings designer kitchens amenities like clubhouse swimming pools gardens and open spaces conference and business centers ample parking with car elevators library and the list seems to be ever evolving security concerns itself have risen way above just a uniformed watchman cctv cameras video door phones coupled with fingerprint and swipe card access with hi tech alarm systems have become a must for south mumbais premium residential properties
384553 a project is truly premium if it has exclusivity and uniqueness it has to exude quality in every aspect the entire feel should be such that the buyer gets the feeling of being treated like a king and not like a regular person this for realty here is a totally new paradigm

384577 nakshatra was discontinued by aishwarya it is false news that she lost out the endorsement to katrina kaif aishwarya had some conditions and the company did not come to terms with this so she called it off
384578 endorsements are not a competition nobody loses an endorsement it is just that sometimes the technicalities dont work out between the endorser and the brand at the end of the day an endorser is asked to endorse a product because ones image looks best suited to the brand

384656 para el siguiente a o habr un ahorro equivalente a los 100 millones de pesos
384657 actualmente los hospitales de la secretar a de salud atienden a 22 mil pacientes con tratamiento antirretroviral y 200 medicados con f rmacos de rescate
384658 por mandato de ley cualquier texto debe ser valorado por la dependencia responsable de materiales educativos de la sep este proceso no se ha llevado a cabo y por lo tanto el libro no puede formar parte del plan educativo
384659 porque muchos de los enfermos que viven en zonas aisladas o marginales no cuentan con la atenci n
384660 el conocimiento promueve la vida y la ignorancia la muerte
384661 la educaci n contribuye a reducir la vulnerabilidad del contagio de vih porque informa sobre las maneras de contagiarse y como cuidarse
384662 vamos a impulsar una educaci n que promueva la inclusi n social y tolerancia para evitar la discriminaci n y estigma que sufren miles de personas con el vih
384663 vamos a garantizar las oportunidades educativas a ni os y j venes que las han perdido por padecer el mal o incluso sus padres por esta enfermedad
384664 estamos ante una dolorosa realidad que tiene a miles de nombres y apellidos historias de vida de esperanza de dolor y frustraci n

384667 por lo que debe llegar a todos las personas desde edades muy tempranas
384668 esta va a garantizar el derecho a la informaci n con el fin de que los j venes conozcan los riesgos asociados al ejercicio de su sexualidad
384669 la contribuci n de las instancias educativas son piedra angular de esta tarea
384670 con un proceso de educaci n permanente en el que participen la familia la escuela las instituciones publicas y privadas los medios de comunicaci n y la sociedad en su conjunto se puede lograr
384671 cada minuto en alguna parte del mundo un ni o o un adolescente menor de 15 a os se contagia del vih
384672 son personas que no tienen acceso f cil a los programas de prevenci n porque sus actividades son ilegales o no usan el cond n
384673 no se nos olvide el contagio de vih que sufren los ni os o los j venes de am rica latina y el caribe se debe a que hay silencio sobre el sexo o las drogas en las escuelas y en sus casas

384692 mr rudd has a responsibility to describe how compensation is going to work
384693 plague pestilence and disease famine death drought and bleaching of the great barrier reef
384694 mr rudd is wanting australia to believe that if australia does not act then that will be the outcome
384695 the truth is if the world does not act and the science is right then that will be the scenario
384696 this is a tax that will go through every household and every small business in australia
384697 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
384698 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
384699 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

384718 nobody had considered a naval vessel would have a huge foreign component to it which is a little shocking
384719 the reason the mary rose sank is because there was very poor communication between the crew because you have this really large foreign contingent and they probably did make a bad manoeuvre and that was probably the reason the ship sank

384725 is that they are universal around the world once you lock up a short simple domain you can market the hell out of it and cash in on the high revenue e gaming photographic images industry
384726 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making e gaming photographic images related buying decisions

384728 one of the most amazing e gaming photographic images related sales we had was in last septembers auction
384729 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the e gaming photographic images domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
384730 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
384731 this is good news for all those in the e gaming photographic images marketing business
384732 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
384733 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the e gaming photographic images internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain
384734 but when you think about it you want a domain that people can remember and a domain that is free of any blacklist status so that you can use it to freely communicate with e gaming photographic images customers

384751 for all the trappings of civilized society and our attempts to restrain and civilize it sex remains forever the chaotic vital force eclipsing our hearts and capturing our minds winging on the airwaves in the throbbing beat of rock and roll ensnaring all in loves enticements and torments from our founding creation myths to our greatest dramatic performances its mountains of spice span the great divide between divine comedy and stark tragedy

384760 we conceptualize self in terms of dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous i positions in an imaginal landscape the i has the possibility to move as in a space from one position to another in accordance with changes in situation and time the i fluctuates among different and even opposed positions the i has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice so that dialogical relations between positions can be established the voices function like interacting characters in a story
384761 today for many folks the internet is the first place they turn when theyre looking for a business service or researching a company if you dont yet have a website for your va business i guarantee youre missing out on opportunities

384764 since then neither ofcom nor any other agency has had a statutory responsibility for content standards in on demand services provided by non bbc providers
384765 in relation to on demand services however a new regulatory structure will be required in the uk in order to implement the avms directive and oversee the new content and advertising standards
384766 the governments strong preference supported by the directive is for a system of co regulation
384767 this would allow the uk video on demand industry itself to take the lead in setting and enforcing standards for the content of its services there would need to be legislation which allowed either the government or ofcom as the national regulator to intervene but only if strictly necessary and as a last resort
384768 for the most part the scheme would be expected to operate independently with little if any intervention by government or ofcom if it could not do so it would have failed and would have to be replaced
384769 we need to ensure that traditional protections against inappropriate content and advertising standards are secured as technology advances
384770 while citizens embrace the opportunities offered by massively increased choice of content and can watch on demand on tvs online or phones its right that the same standards apply
384771 my instincts remain that if we were to relax the ban on product placement we would put at risk the integrity in british programming that underpins its international reputation
384772 but im open to hearing other views if as some in the industry are saying this is a crucial step for broadcasters then the industry must marshal strong arguments and put forward a convincing case
384773 on declaration of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety
384774 this is not encouraging the rate is low compared to the progress of malaysia
384775 a lack of awareness and expertise is contributing to the low rates

384777 we recommend that employers give a one hour break for nursing mothers it is up to the mothers to decide on the frequency

384780 i always look forward to attending the world future society conferences because hundreds of interesting futurists academics and business leaders gather to talk about fascinating topics and this year looks like it will be especially interesting

384785 the latest trend shows that import has not been taken place and high prices in domestic market to bring the month end stock high it will continue for 6 more days because orders of rubber demanded on previous month and arranges dispatch within 7 days that may be a reason by the dealers to give month end stock before dispatching and the manufacturers will include the same quantity as including transit as month end stock means a doubling may occur in month end stock the import can be done after 7th august which will reflect on international price with an increase

384790 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
384791 my concern is that if gm goes into chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the u s or they go bankrupt altogether and out of canada my pension is going to be cut nearly in half
384792 no pensioners should not be concerned he said we are confident about the future of the business and the cash situation we are going to be here for another 100 years
384793 it seems to me the gm shortfall is far beyond anything the government would want to cover
384794 we need to jointly consider how best to improve that security through assuring appropriate financing of caw members pensions
384795 i think its inevitable gm will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the u s but that doesnt mean that all the gm plants will close
384796 it simply means they are operated by a trustee and gm will start bargaining with everyone the union and banks and bondholders but the operations will continue they dont cut off pensions they may very well negotiate with the uaw in the u s to change the pension plan from a defined benefit but we would never agree to that in canada
384797 as there was some confusion at the time of the extended warranty purchase
384798 so far ive had no response to any of my messages
384799 i expect that unravelling the mess might take some time but an acknowledgement of my concerns would be nice
384800 there was an error and the account is being corrected
384801 were also crediting the account with 100 as a reflection of our commitment to making things right for our clients
384802 had we acknowledged the receipt of the original email in a more timely manner the clients concern could have been avoided
384803 we are seeing less relocation to take jobs and thats directly tied to the home and mortgage situation

384807 weak u s sales reflect the impact of slumping house prices the ongoing credit crunch deteriorating job prospects and record gasoline prices
384808 vehicle prices have been down in real terms all year somewhere in the 3 to 5 per cent range

384810 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry chief executive carlos ghosn said in a statement
384811 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
384812 gm does not face imminent liquidity concerns but we think it will need to raise liquidity over the next 12 to 18 months
384813 the second half cash flows are fully baked into our plan
384814 ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
384815 we now expect that the pre tax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 per cent
384816 i am not surprised the trend is there you make things cheaper and people trade more they become active by definition
384817 five years ago that 20 trade would have cost you maybe 200
384818 youve basically allowed these people to become trading junkies which is okay i mean im from the business i think there is nothing wrong with that you are basically making it easier for people to be more strategic
384819 the difference is the real day traders are the ones you are renting a space to and they sit there at your office and go crazy now they are just sitting at home
384820 day traders never held positions they bought and sold active traders actually in many cases are quite happy holding a position if it doesnt work out
384821 day traders had no interest in fundamentals active traders do have interest in fundamentals
384822 overall trading volumes are up it is being mainly driven by those who are actively following the marketplace
384823 our trades this year are up about 13 per cent and the active trader segment is up about 16 per cent
384824 you are seeing these big swings and sort of weekly daily prices on a stock
384825 are jumping in and jumping out as stocks move that much
384826 our new account open numbers are up over last year as well as our active traders numbers where trading volume has increased by 50 per cent over last year
384827 it is very interesting to watch how significantly the active trader segment has grown over the last several years it is one of the only financial segments that isnt mature
384828 it depends on how you describe or define day trader i think we have to be careful because when you look at the active trader segment there isnt any one profile commonality other than they all trade a lot

385062 no s si esto lo plante gente de nosotros que cree que es una gran idea o algunos de ellos opositores para enturbiar el ambiente
385063 nos parece terriblemente injusto que se lleve a una mayor a los derechos de una minor a
385064 restituir las cosas a su estado original sin perjuicio de que se discuta el mejor derecho de posesi n en la v a contenciosa
385065 esa resoluci n es algo ins lito no tom en cuenta la parte p blica es un fallo improcedente la sala constitucional ha indicado que la zona p blica debe ponerse al servicio de los ciudadanos creo que es contradictoria esta resoluci n
385066 este caso es nico en el pa s por la zona en que est ahora la municipalidad no pueden demoler el fallo es irrecurrible
385067 nos parece que es un triunfo amparado en la legalidad de nuestro pa s en el que se reconocen los derechos de los recurridos

385085 there now is no question that this harm is being caused by human activity its warming up the planet and melting the glaciers
385086 there is nothing in the u s hurricane damage record that indicates global warming has caused a significant increase in destruction along our coasts
385087 warmer air can carry more water and this means more heavy precipitation in the central united states big midwestern storms that used to be seen every 20 years or so will likely occur every four to six years by centurys end
385088 global warming can mean colder it can mean drier it can mean wetter thats what were dealing with
385089 most assuredly i say to you he who believes in me the works that i do he will do also and greater works than these he will do because i go to my father and whatever you ask

385091 when rebecca went it was just like losing a limb
385092 i found my best friend in that house i do fancy rebecca and i did not think i would fancy someone like rebecca
385093 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
385094 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
385095 well ok i think john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
385096 some jcpc members appear to have financial and program evaluation conflicts of interest
385097 we actually began addressing this in our 2006 strategic plan
385098 this isnt the first time they had one person who wanted to serve on the planning board and serve on another board
385099 it would be better to have a broad ethics policy
385100 as much as it pains us not to have them on the committee we dont want to have the appearance of a conflict of interest
385101 its difficult to volunteer for something for no pay and no benefits
385102 it is more important for me to be able to look back on my career and know that i have contributed with ten schools in africa than the goals i have scored on the football field
385103 the country lying between the himalayan mountain and bindu sarovara is known as hindusthan by combination of the first letter hi of himalaya and the last compound letter ndu of the word bindu
385104 this theory was initially proposed by christian scholars in the 19th century their conclusions were biased by their pre existing belief in the hebrew scriptures old testament the book of genesis which they interpreted literally appears to place the creation of the earth at circa 4 000 aryan invasion
385105 destroyed by outside invasion but by internal causes and most likely floods
385106 that was believed to have followed the aryan invasion may never have happened
385107 we had two tough games against odense and now we are determined to do as well as possible
385108 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
385109 when i was on holiday i never went on to the internet i never read the newspapers so to be honest i was with my family so my phone was off so i didnt know what was happening
385110 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
385111 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
385112 now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
385113 vaughany said something very important to me just before i went out to bat and said dont be reckless but be aggressive and i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper
385114 i was going out there and trying to take the bowlers on which is how i play my best cricket and so it was nice to go out there and try to score from ball one
385115 i wasnt going to change my way from ball one i said i was going to go out there and be aggressive i wanted to go out there and give it a good go
385116 i just wanted to continue in that manner whether i was in the 90s or we were six down and really forget about the situation and just watch the ball and hit it and it worked for me
385117 i havent scored the runs so far in test cricket this year and i was under a lot of pressure
385118 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
385119 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms

385121 provide an opinion as to why the sexual offenses allegedly committed by mr abril against w g and m w as pre adolescent early adolescent girls may have had substantially different impact on their psychological development and subsequent life course
385122 it is our clinical opinion that the dramatic differential impact of mr abrils alleged sexual exploitation of the two girls is attributable in large part to differences between the girls in different areas
385123 through discovery the undersigned counsel has developed evidence relating to one of the alleged victims that he believes is admissible
385124 we request that this court conduct such a hearing so that a ruling on the admissibility of said evidence came be made prior to trial

385144 four hamas militants including mohammed ghazal a member of the hamas leadership in the west bank have been released on abbass orders
385145 it is insufficient because around 200 hamas members have been arrested in the past few days and we expect these political prisoners to be released

385153 doesnt redd seem much more enthusiastic playing for team usa than he ever does playing for the bucks or is that just me is anyone else annoyed by that or is that just me

385169 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism

385175 when the doctors told me they had to take two of my fingers off i demanded that they sew them back on
385176 it took a long time but now it doesnt hold me back luckily im right handed
385177 i met survivors in the states who couldnt get their noses reconstructed because they couldnt afford it even though they have the professionals who can do the surgeries
385178 ive met people who live reclusively and that just makes me cringe
385179 my first visit out of the hospital we went christmas shopping i could barely walk but i didnt have a choice
385180 i saw a w5 documentary about a camp for young burn survivors in edmonton i started surfing the net to see if there was any camp like this in ontario
385181 to provide an opportunity for children between the ages of 7 to 17 recovering from burn injuries to meet other children who share similar experiences in a camp environment
385182 then you realize they are kids and they are having fun their burns become not what you notice about them they stand out because they climbed to the top of a wall or learned archery
385183 i want the campers to understand not to let their injuries hold them back life can be good
385184 it makes me want to go to the kids school and beat that bully up
385185 its good for the firefighters because when they see kids at a fire its horrible at camp they see kids in a canoe who are overcoming their injuries
385186 sometimes a parent will say my child has mobility issues and needs to be carried around and the kid gets off the bus and starts playing soccer

385191 sixteen palestinians were wounded this morning in an exchange of fire as hamas tried to arrest those allegedly behind the bomb attack
385192 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
385193 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm
385194 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children

385197 we have been betrayed by the current conservative government and ideology has trumped rational public health decision making
385198 the reality is we know treating those that need treatment will save lives keep their homes together and prevent hiv transmission to children and into the community why the hell arent we doing it
385199 it was just a matter of me going out there and trusting my game
385200 i was able to get a couple hits and hit a sac fly and hit a sac bunt so i felt like i did it all tonight
385201 he made a great debut and im excited to see him play every day
385202 lowrie was coming in full speed and it was a close play at first it was a tough play
385203 you hate to see a game end on a little hit like that but then again maybe thats probably typical as well as the ball was thrown tonight by both teams maybe thats a typical finish for such a well pitched game by everybody involved
385204 we just decided that we were going to move on today start new
385205 were going to look back at the end of the season at today and decide whether we did it from today and if we did we make it to the playoffs if not we gave it our best
385206 well when we win games thats when we feel better
385207 thats probably never going to change we show up every day to win a game and when we win we feel better
385208 theres a way to go about winning and we talked about that today
385209 we just kind of reminded all of ourselves about that today
385210 i dont think thats fair were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a contributing member of a winning baseball team
385211 if that ball couldve snuck out for me it wouldve been better
385212 i wouldve like to have done it in nine innings because its been a long day but it doesnt matter really
385213 it definitely ranks up there as one of the better moments ive had
385214 i think he had a pretty good heartbeat going anyway
385215 this place continues to amaze me the way the fans welcomed him you only see that here
385216 the trade will take care of itself through time but we still have other parts that we have to solidify we have to pitch the ball well and play good defense as we do that itll give our offense a chance to get going
385217 we have direction on what our team is and where we need to go
385218 i guess everyone knew it was going to happen and it happened so well see how it goes
385219 manny and i are pretty good friends and of course im going to miss him but this is a business and they did what they had to do so youve got to go from there
385220 its been sour for a pretty good amount of time we were going to run for him if he got to second just because we knew what we were facing if we dont score weve got david and weve got a bunch of lefties but when he fell like that it didnt seem like it was very sensible to leave him in
385221 wake again pitched great and delcarmen gets out of the jam with two aboard and one out in the seventh
385222 pap jonathan papelbon gave us two innings and mike timlin who was credited with the win threw the ball very well and if one of those guys doesnt were up here bemoaning the fact that we didnt score because of the way that happened we scored enough
385223 its hard not to be crazy about young players when you get to see them in their first spring training with a guy like mossy when he wasnt real good and had a lot of learning to do this will be a real good opportunity for him and were pleased for that
385224 hans has been here a little bit longer but it hasnt always gone perfect
385225 again hell have a little bit more of an opportunity than he had here i hope he takes it and runs with it but i dont think anybody wanted to run these kids out of town thats not the idea
385226 either way you had to get to this point and have some closure
385227 it became more of an issue of whether or not he was going to be here and he was pretty adamant he didnt want to be here
385228 it came down to his happiness if they had come to manny and he said he wanted to stay here hed probably still be here its kind of out of our hands im glad theres a resolution there was going to be whether he was here or not
385229 we were in a bit of a difficult circumstance and we made something good of it
385230 and when you see his quotes every day thats something different i dont think its surprising but it was weird
385231 if dustin pedroia said the same comments we think hes a martian if manny says it people like it its front page news
385232 its very hard to tangibly evaluate how hurt someone is
385233 id like to and still do take his word for it until someone comes up to me and says i faked the injury its kind of like barry bonds everyone has crucified him but i still have to believe hes innocent until someone proves him guilty
385234 but it was clear he was unhappy here and we needed a productive manny ram rez
385235 his whole career was remarkable he is one of the best righthanded hitters in history and no one can ever take that away from him
385236 well see hopefully everything will start going good everybody moves on and we go where we are supposed to be
385237 i was very pleased what we care about all of us together is our team and i think we sit here feeling pretty good about our team
385238 im going to look like a baby now they got some rules here i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys
385239 i just asked how important it was to him i asked him what he wanted to do hell clean it up a little bit he wants to be treated like everybody else
385240 im not going to waste energy when people talk like that
385241 i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston whatever happened in boston is in the past when people ask about boston i put my brain on pause
385242 from the bottom of my heart i want to thank the fans of boston
385243 i love you guys youve been with me through ups and downs
385244 i dont think any of his managers coaches or teammates said he wasnt running out balls
385245 his style was the same and they had a lot of success with him
385246 in boston the fans the organization and the teammates were never an issue he preferred another city along the lines of the lifestyle he had in cleveland he enjoyed being in another experience other than the intensity of boston
385247 manny said he didnt want to leave boston i didnt want to leave there were not the only ones that have gone through it theres a track record i played with mo vaughn i played with roger clemens
385248 it just seemed like toward the end if there was a chance a guy wasnt coming back you started hearing more negative stuff about the guy youd hear rumbling about certain people and it seemed like those were the ones who didnt come back
385249 im kind of nervous when i was a little boy in the dominican republic my first baseball uniform was one from the dodgers no 30 so the no 30 has always been my favorite
385250 just come and play and move on im happy to be here la is a great city in boston and now in los angeles ive always had the support of the latinos i feel at home here
385251 i accomplished a lot out there in boston two world series and i did a great job thanks to god and well thats in the past

385316 one of the truly great leaders in america a moral compass a spiritual guide
385317 adl has acknowledged and never denied the massacres of hundreds of thousands of armenians and by some accounts more than one million at the hands of the ottoman empire in 1915 1918
385318 he has been the staunchest leader of our christian evangelical movement in many areas but especially most especially his close ties and advocacy for the freedom and independence of the state of israel
385319 one of the truly great leaders in america a moral compass a spiritual guide
385320 obviously i find these remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible and i repudiate them i did not know of them before rev hagees endorsement and i feel i must reject his endorsement as well i have said i do not believe sen obama shares rev wrights extreme views but let me also be clear rev hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual advisor and i did not attend his church for 20 years i have denounced statements he made immediately upon learning of them as i do again today
385321 i believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in america and i believe that even though he endorsed me and i didnt endorse him the fact is that i repudiate such talk and i reject his endorsement
385322 i know that but i got traded to pittsburgh from san diego for brian giles in essence in 2003 and once again it wasnt quite the grand scale of this one but its something i cant control im not going to be manny ram rez i know that im going to try to do what i can do kind of going through what ive gone through i think im equipped to handle that youve got to go out and play the game i understand that that stuff is out there but thats beyond my control
385323 its going to be something ill probably never forget thats for sure i cant wait everyone says the best fans in baseball are here and i cant wait to be a part of the home team
385324 if it had been a double i dont know if i wouldve scored on that ball
385325 when it left the bat i thought it had a chance to be a home run but then it started drifting on me a little more toward center field so well take what we can get that wouldve been something else
385326 but that was fun its definitely one of the better moments ive had
385327 pack a bag get on a flight get here meet the entire team and an entire staff and then go out there and play a game and all of a sudden just have it click that youve been deposited in the middle of a pennant race and you have a chance to win a ring
385328 i dont think its going to resonate that quick i think i might need a day or two to let it sink in i fully intend to let it sink in
385329 it was slim pickings when it came down to the numbers
385330 eric davis was a childhood idol of mine and he wore no 44 so why not
385331 i just went home and packed my bag and got here at 1 oclock
385332 my name was everywhere and the deadline passed and i thought all that and nothing all of a sudden a half hour after the deadline i get called into the office and they say youve been traded if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to i dont think
385333 its actually stupid but i remember the stands singing sweet caroline
385334 i thought that was kind of neat just the way everyone got into the game
385335 the nice thing about bays makeup is he knows who he is and he doesnt try to be more than that
385336 hes very comfortable with who he is as a person hes not going to put on airs or try to change the way he plays the game the way he acts just because hes in a different environment
385337 hes not an immature kid who is still searching for his place on a roster or his place in the world
385338 there are no guarantees any time a player changes environments there are no guarantees over a small sample size of a couple of months but we feel like if anyone can come and step in and contribute to a winning club in this environment bay has the opportunity to do that
385339 talk to them every day and look at what they are building
385340 ive been as patient as i can now youve got to scrum properly
385341 the amounts were very very very small and were not of the sort that would affect the human body or the environment
385342 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
385343 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
385344 this council cannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred throughout the conflict in darfur
385345 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
385346 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not
385347 the iraqi government is refusing any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and it is considering it illegal and unconstitutional
385348 the incident occurred in sauki district friday evening when a convoy of the coalition forces passing the area aas a result four soldiers and their afghan colleague were killed
385349 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
385350 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
385351 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
385352 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
385353 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
385354 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
385355 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
385356 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
385357 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
385358 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
385359 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has

385365 you are not eligible if you are on gau or gax or tanf
385366 i dont think any of our clients were spending it on anything trivial
385367 most of the money has gone directly to pay bills especially food utility and rent
385368 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
385369 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
385370 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
385371 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
385372 its a lovely place to start something new i began my modeling career there we will be opening another joint in mumbai soon lap will raise the bar for lounges in mumbai and delhi the interiors of lap will be done by the best architect in india nozer wadia you will really have to wait for its opening to know any more details

385374 well the credit goes to the director abhishek kapoor and niharika who has worked on everyones look rock on is inspired from individuals all over the world who have a dream but somewhere due to many uncanny reasons we brush it off one is stuck in the mundane routine of life would life be any different if you get an opportunity to change it is the question often asked the film is a musical and realistic it talks a lot about relationships friendship the band is called magic i am the lead guitarist of the band and farhan is the lead singer luke kenny is keyboardist while purab is the drummer it is the journey of magic prachi is fabulous in the film she is one of female actors in the film the other girl is sahana goswami she has a difficult role to play and suhana has done an amazing job

385403 he killed her the moment she returned home last night but forensic tests showed that the girl was a virgin
385404 you have to be careful because theres unruly people out there
385405 the fact i had never come across honour killings before i came to england and i grew up in dubai is quite telling

385407 forced marriages are not being addressed because people are being too pc
385408 you know about girls who are 15 or 16 and their parents force their marriages there were four girls in my year at secondary school in leicester whose parents forced their marriages in most cases the people who do this are not savage but have respectable jobs its nothing to do with education

385416 irans constitution provides for equality of all iranians before the law but as our report shows this is not the reality for kurds in iran the iranian government has not taken sufficient steps to eliminate discrimination or to end the cycle of violence against women and punish those responsible

385421 kurds and all other members of minority communities in iran men women and children are entitled to enjoy their full range of human rights the iranian authorities should promote and protect the rights of human rights defenders including womens rights activists and abide by their obligations under international human rights law

385432 how many of us know that movie posters of yesteryears had limited print runs and were circulated only in the metros the smaller towns were given the designs and asked to replicate it as printing was difficult most of it was crude art work in the provincial cities
385433 i bought first edition posters of satyajit ray and mrinal sen movies for just re 1 they were very cheap those days but over the last 10 years the demand for alternative art has grown and movie memorabilia are now sold in auctions
385434 what is popular today is both fashionable trendy and widely accepted i have tried to bridge the gap between yesterdays popular genres and todays kitsch it is a gap redefined in the cultural context between the elite and the popular rich and the poor art and craft
385435 the second half of the century witnessed a definite cultural focus on the indian woman
385436 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
385437 by the time they reach eight theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
385438 we found that both men and women with sleep apnea in the general population not patients mostly undiagnosed and untreated had poorer survival compared with persons without sleep apnea given equal bmi age and sex
385439 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
385440 its great to see that dynamic women in their forties and beyond whose lives are packed 24 7 still take enormous pleasure from the simple things in life
385441 they may be bombarded by consumer choice at every turn but in their heart whatever the financial climate they know that the best things in life are free
385442 im afraid a lot of inaccuracies and fabrications have crept into the reports in india about my sonia project yes i did meet her but she has not given the nod to the project nor has she said no
385443 she was gracious but noncommittal and extremely genteel she wanted to know if biopics were made about living people i pointed out several films on nelson mandela i told her i didnt want to make a film about sonia the politician but about two individuals from disparate backgrounds who fall in love and make a life together
385444 i told her things she thought no one knew when she came from italy to england she went to a school of languages in cambridge to learn english i also told her about the bakery in london where rajiv used to clean the chimney in the night about that bird in a nest in his room in london for which he wouldnt close the window in the night so the bird could return home and soniajis fondness for the ice creams that rajivji took her to have at india gate
385445 es un virus que modificamos para incorporar en su genoma una prote na purificada de un alga que responde a la luz explica schinder despu s de inyectarlo en el cerebro de los roedores dejamos pasar varios meses y luego estudiamos el tejido que presumimos que tiene neuronas nuevas cuando las iluminamos con un flash de luz azul esta prote na abre peque os poros en la membrana de esas c lulas denominados canales esto hace que la neurona se active y propague a su vez esta actividad hacia otras neuronas de la red
385446 el trabajo es muy novedoso e importante por varias razones opina gabriel corfas que no particip en la investigaci n y es profesor en la escuela de medicina de harvard primero porque demuestra por primera vez que neuronas nacidas en el cerebro de un organismo adulto se incorporan en los circuitos neuronales de manera similar a las nacidas durante el desarrollo embrionario estas observaciones indican que es muy posible que las neuronas generadas en el cerebro adulto contribuyan al procesamiento de la informaci n y el aprendizaje
385447 otro aspecto que vale la pena destacar es el elegante uso de numerosas tecnolog as de punta para desentra ar procesos esenciales para la funci n de las neuronas
385448 un claro ejemplo es el empleo de virus para introducir mol culas que permiten estimular con luz neuronas nacidas en el adulto para as poder definir como est n conectadas a las redes neuronales preexistentes

385454 we had a lot of sleepless nights but its been worthwhile
385455 sometimes in the middle of the night i wake up with it on my mind that is the hardest time but if you can make it until morning then it is never as bad as during the middle of the night
385456 my only pressure was to express myself the way i wanted to or i would let myself down other people selling units is separate from my pressures as an artist
385457 a lot of bands would say that making an album has moments of euphoria and times when you worry about expressing an idea and a vision onto a piece of plastic that is a cd trying to get as close to the melody and what you imagine can be difficult
385458 the album is what i always hoped it could be
385459 i have too much respect for kriss and his family to say that it is a song about him if i was doing a song about him iwould make sure that it was the most beautiful song ever
385460 but i was influenced by seeing his mum and other mums as well on tv it put me in the position of thinking what if it was my own mum things like other peoples misfortune stick in my mind it is the same as when i put myself in peoples fortune
385461 the song stabbed is the sense of feeling fear and how you can be quite vulnerable some of the things that have stayed in my mind have poured out of me
385462 i met somebody years ago that went out one night and his pal got into a fight and he kicked a guy and got done with manslaughter
385463 before he went out that night he was a normal boy with a normal job and everything had been going right and obviously that night changed everything for him
385464 it must start with taking it to grass roots level by saying how can you harm another person
385465 its as simple as that that is the thought in my mind before you get into stats and pie charts there needs to be some vision and direction
385466 i used to go to st mungos school in glasgows east end
385467 i didnt grow up playing music so that was a far out concept for them
385468 its funny thats how you get on your familys radar when you are on tv
385469 i just decided that even having a part time job would have bogged me down in the politics of being in a job and being weighed down by everything that went with it i wanted to be adaydreamer at home and listen to lots of records and make music thats what i did
385470 glavegas is fairly recent we were novices and started with the basics
385471 my cousin and the bass player and me were pals i started getting some ideas together for songs then met caroline
385472 we started with a drum machine because shed never played drums a year ago we played a gig and caroline got the kit in she plays two drums now
385473 thats what i mean about being novices we started with the basics
385474 christel simms is a swimmer born in hawaii with double citizenship usa and philippines in 2007 she took part in an international swimming event as a us athlete she has been entered in the olympic games 2008 by the philippines noc with the authorization of the usoc however the international swimming federation fina did not authorize her entry due to the fact that she did not have a permanent residence in the philippines during at least twelve months prior to the event christel simms requests that the fina decision be overturned by cas

385503 im still kind of shocked and surprised to be honest with you he just never came across as the type of person that could do something like that he was a nice guy
385504 he was there every day he did a good job was friendly and really we had no problems with this individual at all
385505 she mentioned that hed had an emergency he had to go out of town and that she wasnt sure where he went and wasnt sure if hed be back the following morning to deliver his newspapers
385506 its early and i think the judge just wants to respect his rights to speak to counsel and hes giving him that opportunity
385507 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that
385508 he has a lot of friends and they all are very upset hes gone and they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
385509 the rcmp are mindful of the range of emotions being experienced by the family of the deceased over the loss of their loved one in such a horrific incident our thoughts are with them
385510 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
385511 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
385512 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
385513 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
385514 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
385515 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
385516 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
385517 we find the actions of university of minnesota morris professor paul myers reprehensible inexcusable and
385518 the founding fathers did not envision a freedom from religion rather a freedom of religion
385519 the freedom of religion means that no one has the right to attack malign or grossly offend a faith tradition they personally do not have membership or ascribe allegiance

385521 i am catholic i find homosexuality offensive to my religion there is a homosexual who is not catholic therefore they have no right to be homosexual they are violating my rights

385523 that inalienable right being the right not to be or even to feel offended by others their own words not mine

385547 let me clarify that when i say america i mean the united states of america as a majority of people often do most people overlook the fact that america is actually a continent with a large number of interesting and varied countries that are not in the least bit as horrible as the usa
385548 it is arrogant to assume that you own all 23 countries bla bla bla insert more pseudo intellectual rhetoric here
385549 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
385550 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
385551 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
385552 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
385553 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
385554 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
385555 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
385556 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
385557 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
385558 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
385559 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
385560 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
385561 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
385562 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
385563 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
385564 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
385565 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
385566 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
385567 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
385568 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
385569 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
385570 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
385571 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
385572 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone

385599 it is with the deepest regret we announce that the v73 qsl bureau is
385600 it was originally located in the 1976 bicentennial exhibit a nation of nations
385601 now when that was closed it was subsequently moved to a series of different exhibits which had a connection somehow with amateur radio johnston says
385602 most recently it was in an exhibit called information age
385603 but that was removed during a major renovation of the museum so our station closed along with that exhibit
385604 we had operators from all over the world whod come by
385605 the part i particularly enjoyed was in the spring when the school groups would come by and they would see our station
385606 and we were one of the few exhibits that had live people in it so we had an opportunity to talk with them directly and show them how amateur radio worked and what it was all about give them an introduction
385607 the amazing part was the diversity of people from all over the united states from all over the world
385608 they came and either visited the station or worked the station or sat down and did some operating
385609 we were the closest station to the white house we were the closest station to the fcc
385610 and we were right on the mall in washington d c its some really prime real estate and it was a wonderful opportunity to show off ham radio
385611 well im going to hang onto the license and i have every hope that we will establish an exhibit in one of the museums at some future date
385612 for us to win this game were going to rely heavily on them
385613 a loss would almost eliminate us at this point just in terms of morale
385614 i dont think we could afford to go down another six points to this team
385615 but at this point our club needs to get a win wherever possible whether its in oakland santa clara or san francisco
385616 elana but what about how your own pitching skills are pretty horrible and always seem to involve you talking about agricultural terrorism
385617 its about killer robots sent back in time to bring about the end of the world
385618 its about a hooker with a heart of gold who uses sex to heal the somewhat broken heart of a billionaire
385619 the bottom line comes down to relationships and how you treat others

385624 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the u s olympic team as possible
385625 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
385626 as a result of jessica hardys withdrawal from the u s olympic team usa swimming will follow the published u s olympic team selection procedures which were approved by the usoc and posted in their final format on february 22 2008 according to the pre approved procedures swimmers from the existing roster will be placed in the open events rebecca soni will swim the 100m breaststroke and kara lynn joyce will swim the 50m freestyle

385638 swimming is privileged to have such an accomplished sports administrator in kevin neil take over from glenn and the board is delighted to have kevin in the position as ceo
385639 he is not only very well respected in the sporting and corporate world but he brings to the position a wealth of experience in not only managing a major sport but also the marketing and business nous required to take the sport forward in the future
385640 we have a wonderful product from the grass roots of our community to the very elite of our sport who will represent australia in the coming days at the beijing olympic games
385641 i know every member of the board is excited to have a person of kevins caliber at the helm as we enter what i believe to be one of the most exciting eras in our sport
385642 we have some great initiatives at all levels which we believe will only enhance our community involvement
385643 i personally am looking forward to working with kevin as is everyone who has come across his path in his already short time in the sport
385644 he has taken a real interest in every aspect of swimming and i believe his instant interest as a board member created an impression that he was genuinely keen to do whatever he could to further the sport and thats a great trait
385645 it was only six months ago that i came on to the board and here i am as the ceo its funny how things turn out but from the outset i was comfortable around the people i met and excited with the product
385646 when glenn resigned to take up his position at nsw tennis i thought long and hard about taking the plunge into a sport i must admit i knew little about until this year but i have certainly liked what i have seen and i am excited about assisting in taking the sport into an exciting new era
385647 for believers el tiempo wrote the prayer was more than effective since only two days after the presidents of the three countries shook hands during the group of rio summit and for many the crisis was over
385648 we have prayed a lot to the lord and to the blessed mother that this rescue would be successful and we are not going to stop now we are and will continue praying for this intention
385649 was guided in every way by the light of the holy spirit the protection of our lord and the virgin mary
385650 the devotion and commitment he has to jesus and mary
385651 to the lord and the virgin mary who have saved him and continue to watch over him because he always prays to them and he is working hand in hand with the church
385652 thanks be to god we are beginning to see some hope in colombia and that is what all of the hostages who have been freed think
385653 i am convinced this is a miracle of the virgin mary
385654 to me it is clear she has had a hand in all of this
385655 the objective is for us to progress so we will try and like the boss says i think we have the quality to compete in this league we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the league
385656 of course man united and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham they are building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got and i cant wait for the season to start it is going to be an exciting one and we will be up for it
385657 for me it is different because the boss is french and he brought me here i dont know many managers in football but i think he is one of the best
385658 to work with a manager like him and players like cesc and robin we are all around 22 to 25 and it is a dream to play for arsenal
385659 so all the ingredients are all together to progress well as a footballer personally and as a team
385660 i know what i have at arsenal and i dont know what i will have somewhere else sometimes of course players think about money but it is not the only thing to think about
385661 at 23 i think you have many years in front of you to get money the objective for me is not to get the big cash it is to prove you can play at a high level for many years and the rest will come
385662 ich bin sehr gl cklich denn die nummer eins ist ein geschenk f r die viele arbeit in der vergangenheit

385685 o pharoah you can apply your physical force upon my body but my heart is under the control of allah where you hold no right or could apply any force know you that even if you cut my body into pieces that will instead of weakening my faith in allah further increase it

385688 allahs messenger informed me that he was going to die so i wept he then informed me that with the exception of maryam daughter of imran i should be the chief lady among the inhabitants of paradise so i laughed
385689 i wish i were a tree so that i could always be busy in allahs remembrance and be absolved of reckoning on the day of judgment i wish i had been a leaf of tree or a blade of grass i wish i had not been born at all
385690 my brethren are more entitled to this distribution o allah keep this money away from me for it brings me temptation
385691 i have accepted islam and now follow the religion of muhammad convey to him my salutation of peace and let him know that i believe in allah and his prophet
385692 dont wait for any surplus or excess of requirements before spending in the path of allah as the requirements go on increasing in the chances of having something the excess will become more and more remote and the time for spending in the path of allah will never come
385693 dont you feel stupid in worshiping part of a tree while you use the rest of it for fuel to bake bread or warm yourself if you should give up these foolish beliefs and practices and become muslim i shall be pleased to accept you as a husband and i would not want from you any charity apart from your acceptance of islam
385694 many amongst men attained perfection but amongst women none attained the perfection except maryam mary the daughter of imran and asiya the wife of firaun pharaoh and the superiority of aishah to other women is like the superiority of tharid i e and arabic dish to other meals
385695 and allah sets forth as an example to those who believe the wife of pharaoh behold she said o my lord build for me in nearness to thee a mansion in paradise and save me from pharaoh and his doings and save me from those that do wrong
385696 let us visit umm aiman may allah be pleased with her as messenger of allah pbuh used to visit her

385751 la parte dedicada a la gesti n del tiempo que desgraciadamente no est en google books
385752 in der d mmerung kann man manchmal schon dem ein oder anderen visuellen trugschlu erliegen
385753 maintaining linux libre takes me two to three minutes a day most of the time no clean up is required because the non free bits in linux tend to remain in place and i have scripts that will let me know whether theres anything new that requires manual intervention it took me several workdays to write these scripts and i still tweak them every now and then but its mostly trivial maintenance these days when a new linux release comes up it takes me just a few minutes of attention to prepare a freed tarball because ive been accumulating the preparation for it throughout its development cycle
385754 its not a community that values users freedom as much as it values convenience
385755 i had reports from developers involved with gnewsense and blag another free distribution whod tried to submit patches to clean up non free software from linux and who had been lets say laughed and cursed out of the room
385756 the idea of adding yet another kernel split was perceived as a risk of bringing all that grief back so the idea of offering additional kernels built out of linux libre was vetoed
385757 it does nothing to address the problem of other obscure chunks of code in the kernel often derived from documentation under non disclosure agreements or from non free drivers that dont offer permission for the code to be distributed under the gnu general public license
385758 to build a complete general purpose operating system exclusively from free software
385759 thats a question i ask myself every time i face this kind of hostility
385760 i expected negative reactions to the idea of replacing the non free kernel
385761 but i thought adding an alternative 100 free kernel built out of 100 free sources was going to be a no brainer
385762 and id really like to be able to recommend to people out there a distro that the company i work for helps create it was quite disappointing that a community that set out to create an operating system exclusively from free software would not permit anyone to install or distribute a system without also installing or distributing non free software
385763 an intellectual property destroyer i cant imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual property business
385764 there is a gate in paradise called ar raiyan and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the day of resurrection and none except them will enter through it it will be said where are those who used to observe fasts they will get up and none except them will enter through it after their entry the gate will be closed and nobody will enter through it
385765 fasting is a shield or a screen or a shelter so the person observing fasting should avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently and if somebody fights with him or abuses him he should tell himtwice i am fasting
385766 by him in whosehands my soul is the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of allah than the smell of musk allah says about the fasting person he has left his food drink and desires for my sake the fast is for me so i will reward the fasting person for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times
385767 whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink i
385768 the truth will not set you free its just giving them building supplys to build traps for you soooo many instances i can think of would be beter if i had just lied me and her started out our relationship upon an agreement of honesty even if it would hurt the other in some stupid idea that it would bring us only more trust and closer dumb never again lies keep people happy so many lies that i know i could have held and she would have never found out so many dark little secrets about people and things with me that if i had not told her i can almost guarentee wed still be together all these secrets and lies would have had zero effect on either her me or our relationship in general if i had just kept them to myself if only i had just never given in to her asking and whining about things theirs secrets i still have that i never told her and ive almost forgotten about them completly and have nothing on my conciousness about them and im sure i could have done the same with the rest my advice 1 your past is your own and nobodys buissness if they cant get over your past fuck em lie lie your ass off your past has exactly zero effect your your future with them now 2 do what you want you will be misrable if you dont dont let them leash you at the same time if theirs deal breaker situations then you get to make rules for them too its a 2 way street
385769 this time this year is bigger than us it goes on long after were gone this town has taken it all out of us made us look at our lives through new eyes
385770 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

385791 ah para uma pessoa d bastante bem dizem que est muito gira depois das obras
385792 although in my lucid but painful perhaps moments i wrote that i would rather wraith in pain than to take solace in illusionary pleasures i am after all no greater or lesser an ordinary human being born out of blood and flesh and virtues and desires and dreams and lust
385793 beyond a certain point there is no return that point has to be reached
385794 why again are you upset all of a sudden things were still fine last night
385795 if i grow one day i might not love you anymore
385796 and it might just be the case that love had never known me
385797 if i say i enjoy toppings better does that necessarily means that i have no taste at all for the cake per se
385798 i am not in a position to say anthing or give advise
385799 i think i am not in a position you ought to sort out lifes lesson yourself and in those experience the lessons speak to only you
385800 you may not want to hear this but i am concerned more with the direction of your life much more than your everyday well being
385801 things was still good this afternoon things was still good these few days things were still good last week
385802 i could believe youve said such things to me this morning
385803 i am a human being too and i have got emotions and feelings
385804 i still dont think you are selfish although i know you think so i really dont know its true that at times i think you are selfish but then i cant say with total conviction that you are selfish either
385805 i admit that i am very much involved with myself i love myself tremendously but then i am not the kind that will act primarily out of my own interest nor am i the type that really dont care about the feelings of others
385806 yes i guess so so what does it feel when you see me sad
385807 i would cheer you up as much as i possibly can
385808 i just cant the best i could do is to write one according to my own perspective
385809 there is a question i meant to ask i know you never think so and indeed you wouldnt expect anythign of this sort and you definitely dont want me to think so but still i would like to know what do you expect to receive from me
385810 i know but like i say there ought to be something whether or not you are aware of it
385811 i have taken note of them for along time and i had loved it all the while way back since the night in festival walk
385812 hey i wasnt sure anymore was i the love who took your hand in mine first
385813 the thing is i was the one who gazed into your eyes first
385814 that very moment that very moment when we had past the point of no return no it ought to be earlier
385815 right since i have phophesized the point of no return and tried to hold back but you pressed on and i decided to step over
385816 we are not speaking human languages do you realize that yeung tin yan
385817 no we are not we are speaking in our languages we are speaking in our own tongue and the others would not have understood
385818 i love him the way he is selflessly nice to me
385819 and that he is simple simple minded and straight forward
385820 i am sorry i know i failed to be so
385821 its the same with anything you have to learn through your own experience paying your own way you cant learn from a book
385822 when the orbits of these two satellites of ours happen to cross paths we could be together opening our hearts to each other maybe but that was only for the briefest moments in the next instant wed be absolute solitude until were burned down to nothingness wonderful traveling companions though in the end we are no more than solitary metalpiees going on their very own orbits
385823 i think it is more than fair to say you are my soulmate and im sure you would have no objection to that he was naturally enraptured
385824 all the more why i despise all those who have a tendency to simplify things so much i mean there are virtually and i could say this with utter certainty infinite possibility to the types when it comes to relationship how could the people out there how can they see things from a either you like her or not either you are a couple or things are ambiguous at best mindset
385825 im not sure did i ever cried before vanessa my second girlfriend but i definitely did so in front of heidi my first girlfriend
385826 i have always have the illusions that perhaps you love me slightly more

385837 who is a member of the public is always shifting depending upon historical context and the agendas of those measuring public opinion
385838 the media may not be successful in telling people what to think but it is stunningly successful in telling what to think about
385839 the mass media positioned the agenda for public opinion by emphasizing specific topics
385840 the coming together of separate ideas which through the process of rational discussion or consideration emerged as something greater than the sum of its parts
385841 the modern definition of public opinion tends to exclude those moments when members of the public gather to express a collective opinion
385842 people who are highly educated or who have greater affluence and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion
385843 this is a tax that will go through every household and every small business in australia

385845 mr rudd has a responsibility to describe how compensation is going to work
385846 plague pestilence and disease famine death drought and bleaching of the great barrier reef
385847 mr rudd is wanting australia to believe that if australia does not act then that will be the outcome
385848 the truth is if the world does not act and the science is right then that will be the scenario
385849 the subjects in remission from depression experienced symptoms qualitatively similar to those they had during major depressive episodes
385850 our findings suggest that depression is associated with persistent vulnerability for developing such responses to reduced dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission

385861 dewasa ini generasi muda lebih menyenangi seni yang datangnya dari luar dibandingkan kesenian asli milik bangsa sendiri
385862 jika tidak diantisipasi dengan langkah langkah pelestarian kekayaan tradisi tersebut akan tinggal menjadi sejarah
385863 selama ini penghargaan terhadap pelaku seni sangat jarang padahal para seniman tidak meminta imbalan berupa materi terhadap upayanya melestarikan seni turun temurun mereka hanya ingin ada semacam pengakuan dari pemerintah
385864 untuk menentukannya saat ini sangat sulit karena seni sunda sudah banyak mengadopsi seni dari luar
385865 kalau memang masih mendapat tempat bila sedang pentas pasti akan ditonton pemerintah daerah pun sering menganggap para seniman itu menjadi beban
385866 untuk itu kiranya dalam memahami seni budaya sunda march 10 2008 said
385867 the thing im interested in is connecting with each player and not just go with a blanket technique
385868 thats a little bit cliched i know but you really have to get to know the player you have to get them to trust what youre telling them
385869 the type of hitter were going to try to create is an aggressive but under control hitter
385870 when he steps up to home plate hes ready to hit every pitch until his eyes tell him no he has to see the ball and recognize where its going before he actually goes after it a lot of people are promoting walks in the game and i believe this philosophy leads to that

385872 new literacies have as a central focus the development of students engagement with texts and their context for the meaning making process the constructed process of authorship and questions about how texts represent social realities
385873 relative emphasis on the reader and the socio historical and political contexts in which interpretations take place
385874 to lead the way in providing balanced perspectives on a range of it mediated learning and socialization issues
385875 as parents and educators we cannot do enough to prepare the very young for an uncertain job future
385876 es gibt eine fast endlose m glichkeit wie ein nostale charakter aussehen kann
385877 mobile phones are transforming the experience of place and co presence for a wireless generation of japanese youth
385878 place has become a hybrid relation between physical and wirelessly co present context
385879 mobile phones have revolutionized the experience of arranging meetings in urban space
385880 mobile messages are used to contact a recipient just out of visual range or unavailable for voice contact
385881 mobile email augments the properties of a particular place enabling contact and communication that would not otherwise be available
385882 just as mobile email extends the prior and present parameters of social contact it also extends the possibilities for contact after a gathering
385883 even as these practices challenge existing norms of propriety and place they set up new manners and ways of being together
385884 mobile phones become devices for customizing and personalizing even the most generic of urban spaces
385885 the media mix insists that we also recognize the inverse flow the real is being colonized by the virtual as technologies of the digital imagination become more pervasive in everyday environment
385886 active differentiated and entrepreneurial consumer positions and a high degree of media and technical literacy
385887 appropriation and reshaping of mass cultural content as well as its revaluation through alternative economies and systems of exchange
385888 media mixing also demands that we query the relation between differently materialized and located texts exploring issues of intersextuality multiple materialities and a distributed field of cultural production
385889 the theorization of racial and sexual otherness is occupying a central position within the renewed terrain of cultural critique
385890 it is through the individual parts and through the relations between fragments in the process of decentralization that change continues to engender change
385891 recirculating a limited number of propositions and reshaping stereotypes to criticize stereotyping can however also constitute a powerful practice
385892 diaries memoirs and recollections are widely used by marginalized people to gain a voice and to enter the arena of visibility
385893 displacing established values does not simply consist of moving them around but rather of
385894 critical practice is often reduced to a matter of evaluation and judgment or of declaring what is not right in the state of things
385895 problems of exclusion in and of commodification in the artworld as well as in the theory milieux have always been intimately linked with sexually and racially discriminating practices
385896 every artistic excursion and theoretical venture requires that boundaries be ceaselessly called into question undermined modified and reinscribed
385897 art is neither an appropriation nor an approximation of beauty
385898 little wonder people of all affiliations avoid discussion on a topic which they fear will subject them to personal attack
385899 a new kind of life and society online a democratic public sphere unencumbered by the stultifying routines and alienating hierarchies of the real word
385900 the sense we have of a space behind the monitor screen or the network in which we communicate with distant others or from which we receive images information and services
385901 the net is not just a spectacle for passive consumption but also a participatory activity
385902 technologies far from being merely technical are at once material and symbolic
385903 computers enter into the development of personality of identity and even of sexuality
385904 knowledge is not only central to economic development it becomes raw material and commodity
385905 networks could be seen as more like public theatre than old media
385906 an online home on the other hand is a little hole you drill in the wall of your real home to let the world in
385907 we see videogames not as ephemeral digital toys but as offering distinct perhaps unique opportunities for engaging with and making sense of the complex and intimate relationships networks even between people and computer media technology
385908 established conceptual frameworks for studying media and culture in everyday life whilst productive do not fully address the questions raised by digital media technologies
385909 if you listen carefully to the voice of the lord your god and do what is right in his eyes if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees i will not bring on you any of the diseases i brought on the egyptians for i am the lord who heals you
385910 what kind of views are and can be produced by miyazakis film and the lessons for which it is purpose built the answer resounds throughout the film pantheist pacifist feminist and environmentalist
385911 calm your fury almighty lord whatever you might be leave us in peace
385912 wait i dont want to fight you i am a friend
385913 reading does not consist merely of decoding the written word or language rather it is preceded by and intertwined with knowledge of the world
385914 the understanding attained by critical reading of a text implies perceiving the relationship between text and context
385915 reading the word the phrase and the sentence never entailed a break from reading the world reading the word meant reading the word world
385916 mechanically memorizing the description of an object does not constitute knowing the object
385917 i always saw teaching adults to read and write as a political act an act of knowledge and therefore a creative act
385918 reading the word is not preceded merely by reading the world but by a certain form of writing it or rewriting it
385919 to sum up reading always involves critical perception interpretation and rewriting of what is read
385920 is preceded by and intertwined with knowledge of the world
385921 reading the world always precedes reading the word and reading the word implies continually reading the world
385922 reading is a social practice using written text as a means for the construction and reconstruction of statements messages and meanings
385923 the goal of literacy education was the successful introduction of the student into a cannon of classical english literature
385924 different cultures and subcultures frame up who what and when people read for particular social purposes
385925 our principle purpose here is to disrupt contemporary common sense notions about reading
385926 this move is significant in terms of how we see difference and diversity in the classroom
385927 we argue for a social practice hypothesis that one learns to do with reading what one is taught to do and what is valued and encouraged and useful in cultural interpretive communities and sites
385928 the issue is what kinds of reading practices and positions should schools value encourage and propagate
385929 the issue is how we want to shape reading how we want to form a selective tradition of materials and practices
385930 the models provided here are not mutually exclusive and may overlap in some significant ways
385931 the rightful significance of sociopolitical contexts and issues in reading instruction
385932 the flow of stories ideas information communities brands intellectual properties across media platforms
385933 the core of viral marketing is getting the right idea into the right hands at the right time
385934 in each case entrenched institutions are taking their models from grassroots fan communities reinventing themselves for as era of media convergence and collective intelligence
385935 the current diversification of communication channels is politically important because it expands the range of voices that can be heard
385936 the webs low barriers to entry expand access to innovative or even revolutionary ideas at least among the growing segment of the population that has access to a computer
385937 broadcasting provides the common culture and the web offers more localized channels for responding to that culture
385938 blogging may on one level be facilitating the flow of ideas across the media landscape on other levels they are ensuring an ever more divisive political debate
385939 the mixture of different media systems made campaign 2004 unusually complicated
385940 many bloggers explicitly define themselves in opposition to mainstream media and what they see as its corporately controlled content
385941 activists fans and parodists of all stripes are using the popular graphics software package photoshop to appropriate and manipulate images to make a political statement
385942 does making politics into a kind of popular culture allow consumers to apply fan expertise to their civic responsibilities
385943 consumers and fans are beginning to take pleasure in their newfound power to shape their media environment
385944 when will we be able to participate within the democratic process with the same ease that we have come to participate in the imaginary realms constructed by popular culture
385945 we vote naked not in the sense that we feel an intimate engagement with politics but in the sense that we feel raw exposed and vulnerable
385946 we may be able to talk across our differences if we find commonalities through our fantasies
385947 written language from the centrality which it has held in public communication
385948 reasons range from changes of a social and cultural character to those more to do with technologies of information and of transport
385949 none of the senses ever operates in isolation from the others that from the beginning guarantees the multimodality of our semiotic world
385950 the issue of the medium that is the issue of transmission and dissemination
385951 if mode affects what can be said and how media affects what can be and is addressed and how
385952 insist on the semiotic communicational and meaningful aspects of objects
385953 the visual mode has not been developed into as highly articulated a state as spoken or written language are
385954 the two modes language and the visual simply start from different concerns are embedded in distinct ways of conceptualizing thinking and communicating
385955 mulitliteracies is not merely the assumption that we communicate through and with a range of quite different modes
385956 i went through this all alone no one to talk to no one to hold me when i needed a hug
385957 if you do what youve always done youll get what youve always gotten
385958 when is this going to stop where and when are the blessing going to come
385959 and everyone who calls upon the name of the lord will be saved
385960 jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me
385961 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you
385962 these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me read this chapter
385963 behold i give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you
385964 wait until i find out what the lord commands concerning you
385965 oh my this guy girl is hot but i am not gong to leave here with him her
385966 i sure would like to see a sign i would love to be refreshed
385967 why am i so interested in these things why doves and butterflies
385968 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
385969 how can a man be born when he is old
385970 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
385971 go to your jewelry box and take all that is broken
385972 why did i go there so i can again leave feeling like this
385973 do you remember when you i seen you and i felt the love you put into this deed i am pleased with you
385974 thank you for coming with me so that i am not alone
385975 everyone deals with death in a different way and you really shouldnt concern yourself with who cries and who doesnt thats not what it is about thats just something some people do and others dont
385976 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membuat garis dengan tangannya kemudian bersabda ini jalan allah yang lurus
385977 sebaik baik manusia adalah pada masaku ini yaitu masa para shahabat kemudian yang sesudahnya kemudian yang sesudahnya setelah itu akan datang suatu kaum yang persaksian salah seorang dari mereka mendahului sumpahnya dan sumpahnya mendahului persaksiannya
385978 sesungguhnya allah melihat hati hamba hamba nya dan allah mendapati hati nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah sebaik baik hati manusia maka allah pilih nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sebagai utusan nya allah memberikan risalah kepadanya kemudian allah melihat dari seluruh hati hambah hamba nya setelah nabi nya shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka didapati bahwa hati para shahabat merupakan hati yang paling baik sesudahnya maka allah jadikan mereka sebagai pendamping nabi nya shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang mereka berperang atas agama nya apa yang dipandang kaum muslimin para shahabat rasul itu baik maka itu baik pula di sisi allah dan apa yang mereka para shahabat rasul pandang jelek maka jelak di sisi allah
385979 suatu hari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah shalat bersama kami kemudian beliau menghadap kepada kami dan memberikan nasehat kepada kami dengan nasehat yang menjadikan air mata berlinang dan membuat hati bergetar maka seseorang berkata wahai rasulullah nasehat ini seakan akan nasehat dari orang yang akan berpisah maka berikanlah kami wasiat
385980 aku wasiatkan kepada kalian supaya tetap bertaqwa kepada allah tetaplah mendengar dan taat walaupun yang memerintah kamu adalah seorang budak habasiyyah
385981 ketahuilah sesungguhnya orang orang sebelum kamu dari ahlul kitab telah berpecah belah menjadi tujuh puluh dua golongan dan sesungguhnya agama ini islam akan berpecah belah menjadi tujuh puluh tiga golongan tujuh puluh dua golongan tempatnya di dalam neraka dan satu golongan di dalam surga yaitu
385982 semua golongan tersebut tempatnya di neraka kecuali satu yaitu yang aku dan para shahabatku berjalan di atasnya
385983 maka jika mereka beriman kepada apa yang kamu telah beriman kepadanya sungguh mereka telah mendapat petunjuk dan jika mereka berpaling sesungguhnya mereka berada dalam permusuhan dengan kamu maka allah akan memelihara kamu dari mereka dan dia lah yang mahamendengar lagi maha mengetahui
385984 pada ayat ini allah menjadikan iman para shahabat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sebagai timbangan tolak ukur untuk membedakan antara petunjuk dan kesesatan antara kebenaran dan kebatilan
385985 memohon hidayah dan iman adalah sebesar besar kewajiban menjauhkan perselisihan dan kesesatan adalah wajib jadi mengikuti manhaj shahabat rasul shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah kewajiban yang paling wajib
385986 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia janganlah kalian mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu mencerai beraikan kamu dari jalan nya yang demikian itu diperintahkan oleh allah kepadamu agar kamu bertaqwa
385987 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa terhadap kesesatan yang telah dikuasainya itu dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
385988 artinya rasul telah beriman kepada al qur an yang diturunkan kepadanya dari rabbnya demikian pula orang orang yang beriman
385989 orang orang yang terdahulu lagi yang pertama tama masuk islam di antara orang orang muhajirin dan anshar dan orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik allah ridha terhadap mereka dan mereka ridha kepada allah allah menyediakan bagi mereka surga surga yang mengalir sungai sungai di dalam nya mereka kekal di dalamnya selama lamanya itulah kemenangan yang besar
385990 kamu adalah ummat yang terbaik yang dilahirkan untuk manusia menyuruh kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar dan beriman kepada allah
385991 bab takutnya seorang mumin kalau kalau amalannya terhapus sedang dia tidak menyadarinya
385992 apabila saya mempertimbangkan antara ucapanku dan amalanku saya takut kalau kalau saya termasuk seorang pendusta
385993 amat besar kebencian di sisi allah kalian mengatakan apa apa yang tidak kalian kerjakan
385994 yang demikian dikarenakan seorang mumin mungkin sekali datang kepadanya sesuatu yang menodai amalnya sehingga berubah niatnya menjadi tidak ikhlas tidak berarti mereka terjerumus kepada kemunafikan dikarenakan ketakutan mereka tersebut tetapi ini menunjukkan keutamaan mereka dalam hal wara dan taqwa semoga allah meridhai mereka semuanya
385995 dan orang orang yang memberikan apa yang telah mereka berikan dengan hati yang takut
385996 bukan wahai putri ash shidiq akan tetapi mereka itu adalah orang orang yang berpuasa menjalankan shalat bershadaqah dan mereka takut kalau kalau amal baik mereka itu tidak diterima mereka itulah orang orang yang bersegera untuk mendapatkan kebaikan kebaikan 4
385997 dan abu ar rabi muhammad bin al fadhl al balkhi berkata
385998 sesungguhnya kami mencela manusia padahal mungkin mereka yang dicela tersebut telah disediakan tempat mereka di surga sejak dua ratus tahun yang lalu sejak wafatnya pent
385999 barangkali yang benar sejak seratus tahun yang lalu karena sesungguhnya di zaman yahya belum sampai ke angka tersebut
386000 maka saya masuk menemui abdurrahman bin abi hatim dan dia sedang membacakan buku al jarhu wat tadil kepada manusia lalu saya sampaikan perkataan yahya bin main maka beliau menangis dan kedua tangannya gemetar sampai mengakibatkan bukunya terjatuh dan terus menangis sambil meminta kepadaku untuk mengulangi hikayat tersebut
386001 dia menempuh jalan gentar dan takut akan akibat yang buruk padahal ucapan pengkritik yang wara mengenai orang orang dhuafa termasuk nasehat bagi dien allah dan dalam rangka membela as sunnah 5
386002 barangsiapa yang merasa berkhidmat kepada allah maka segala sesuatupun akan senang berkhidmat kepadanya dan barang siapa tentram dan puas dengan allah maka orang lain tentram pula ketika melihat dirinya
386003 perumpamaan mereka adalah seperti orang yang menyalakan api maka setelah api itu menerangi sekelilingnya allah menghilangkan cahaya yang menyinari mereka dan membiarkan mereka dalam kegelapan tidak dapat melihat mereka tuli bisu dan buta maka mereka tidaklah kembali kepada jalan yang benar
386004 barang siapa yang banyak bicaranya maka banyak kesalahannya sehingga nerakalah sebaik baik tempat bagi mereka
386005 sesungguhnya seorang hamba benar benar mengucapkan kata kata tanpa dipikirkan yang menyebabkan ia tergelincir kedalam neraka lebih jauh antara timur dan barat
386006 barangsiapa yang menahan pandangannya karena allah maka dia akan diberikan oleh allah rasa manisnya iman yang ia rasakan dalam hatinya sampai dimana ia manghadap kepada nya
386007 anak adam tidak memenuhi wadah yang lebih buruk daripada ia memenuhi perutnya cukuplah baginya beberapa suap saja untuk menguatkan tulang rusuknya jika memang tidak memungkinkan maka sepertiga untuk makanan sepertiga untuk minum dan sepertiga untuk nafasnya
386008 ingatlah bahwa hanya dengan selalu mengingat allah hati menjadi tentram
386009 sesungguhnya dzikir adalah makanan pokok bagi hati dan ruh apabila hamba allah gersang dari siraman dzikir maka jadilah ia bagaikan tubuh yang terhalang untuk memperoleh makanan pokoknya
386010 sesungguhnya mengingat ingat allah adalah lebih besar keutamaannya daripada ibadat yang lain
386011 beruntunglah orang yang mendapat dalam buku catatan amal perbuatannya memuat istighfar yang banyak
386012 tidaklah seorang muslim pun berdoa dengan doa yang di dalamnya tidak berisi dosa dan pemutus tali silaturahmi melainkan allah memberikan kepadanya salah satu dari tiga perkara allah akan menyegerakan permohonannya itu diperoleh di dunia atau allah akan menyimpannya untuknya di akhirat kelak atau dia memalingkan darinya keburukan yang setimpal dengan doanya itu
386013 barang siapa yang bershalawat untukku satu kali maka allah akan bershalawat sepuluh kali lipat
386014 malam hari bagi orang yang sering beribadat di dalamnya itu lebih nikmat daripada permainan bagi mereka yang suka hidup bersantai santai seandainya tanpa malam aku tak suka hidup di dunia ini
386015 bagiku kelezatan dunia ini hanya ada pada tiga perkara qiyamullail bersilaturahmi dengan ikhwan dan shalat berjamaah
386016 much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
386017 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans threats and actions
386018 tags a tag is simply a word you use to describe a bookmark unlike folders you make up tags when you need them and you can use as many as you like the result is a better way to organize your bookmarks and a great way to discover interesting things on the web
386019 this allows feeds to be brought in from various sites into one central location for people to read
386020 web syndication is a form of website is made available for other sites to use
386021 ajax is just a style of design one that milks all the features of modern browsers to produce something that feels less web and more desktop
386022 lets give him a few to see if he shows
386023 so omid you wanna take us through pod task 3
386024 but there is a simple way in which others can understand
386025 dosnt he mean copies of your answers to any 3
386026 yea said choose any orl exercises and add them as test entires
386027 it says to duplicate it but i cant access csu interact
386028 5 each pod group should collate a blog report into a single pod group report and post it onto the csu pods sub forum organise a time when members of your pod group can meet and do this step
386029 omid i have a suggestion we could like do that step now
386030 anybody has a suggestion on whether the report is regarding the blog entries or the blog functionality in moo vs interact
386031 because we could and did make completely differnt blog entries
386032 so to me its a report on what you found
386033 ill put them together and post it 2 csu sub forum
386034 okay well send comments through via moo as part of discussing this
386035 it doesnt say it needs to be discussed through moo
386036 csu interact amp frankly i found this blog tool to be hard to use
386037 me suspects there are some funny illegal character in my pasted copy which causes it to have side effects
386038 but i didnt have those problems with moodles blog tool
386039 let me do moodle then i will email em to you both
386040 probably worth adding omid that the appearance of the tag cloud within moodle is very good
386041 i believe the the font size and boldness increase to reflect the higher number of uses of the tag
386042 maybe its there on interact but hop hasnt gotten round to configuring it yet
386043 wouldnt wanna roll up the sleeves in the interact sys config documentation to find that one out though
386044 i just a click around in interact i cant see where theyd cram one in either although sure therd be a way
386045 i found moodle blog easier to use because the options buttons seemed better placed could actually get my entries published with least fuss
386046 it was a bit of a conversation stopper at the time
386047 if id have had to do this course using interact or moodle i wouldnt have found it as compelling to keep an active blog
386048 as i did with wordpress due to it being so much easier to use
386049 instead i could put an rss feed of my blog into the interact or moodle
386050 does interact or moddle all you to input an rss feed tho
386051 so omid theres a suggestion instead of having blogging functionality allow the aggregation of blogs using rss
386052 that way both platforms can leverage the best of breed wikis on the outside world
386053 it measn that blog content would be publicly accessible as well whereas the hosted blog would be private to the group
386054 they cant be expected to be as good as the leading web blog sites
386055 omid you okay to compile the report of comment and submit to the forum
386056 just 2 double check whats the csu pods sub forum link
386057 with question 6 i onwards its getting tricky for mw
386058 just worried i wont be able to supply enough information
386059 6 using your essay on social computing developers from assignment 1 use the wiki tool at the moodle and interact sites to build and edit a larger group essay on the same topic in each wiki
386060 well thats what im not sure if we do one each or jsut pick one persons
386061 just update it during the week when youre ready have time
386062 i e to work in any extra info he have from you assignment 1 essays
386063 hey guys i gotta go my sister needs my computer for while
386064 forms a and b are attached postings in the itc213 pods sub forum
386065 thats the forum message which explains and provides a link to the actual location
386066 ill leave the browser open for moo if while my sister uses my computer
386067 hey i think were all done with pod task 3 and 4
386068 vuze transfers content faster than p2p clients the dj mode erotic dreams is nice
386069 i didnt get any emails back from him did u
386070 got one saying he still doesnt have access to interact
386071 no indictation whether hell join tonight buut having read and replied to the email hes aware of the date time so we can but
386072 not sure if it makes a different even if he says hell arrive
386073 and this is probably the focus of 50 of our work
386074 omid i suspect youll not be able to access that
386075 ive tried everything even spoke to hopper and other members
386076 we pod4 do the last evaluation listed in form a help amp documentation
386077 pod task 4 click that and all the instructions are in there
386078 i been looking through the text wondering if i have the wrong end of the stick again
386079 hey omid since you cant access interact can you tell us where the help and documentation is in moodle urls would be good
386080 lets compile them first thats going to take the longest
386081 need to break answer down per platform 1 moodle 2 interact
386082 that way if we get stuck we can deal as we get to it
386083 well theres no alt text for the options on the left
386084 in interact theres sometimes alt text on the main body options
386085 when you select one of the help options tehres a detailed explination of what the section is about
386086 no just interact wernt we doing one at a time
386087 just to make sure you guys doing form a or b
386088 ah i suspect we should backtrack on 10 12 i think interact merits an n instead of a y
386089 because i find it isnt solving my problems for example i read through it trying to figure out how to create my own wiki page and its just not clear
386090 omid curious why you thing 13 19 should be y for moodle
386091 then youll also like or already listen to dj mode
386092 do you disagree with moodle being yes for 13 19 lan
386093 i think 13 is n for both moodle and interact because for example it doesnt actually explain what a blog wiki etc etc is
386094 not all students e g agriculture police faculties would know what a wiki or blog is so i really feel 13 is n
386095 in this sense i dont feel interact or moodle are as
386096 hopper might be using these finding to conduct serious recommendations
386097 well he did seem pretty keen on getting this part done
386098 well the information in the help section is relevant isnt it
386099 because isnt our part predominently looking in the actual help section rather thenthe site in general
386100 i mean you can chat through moodle if csu interact doesnt work
386101 i cant believe they have no online help in the software
386102 i like to smear myself in jam and then run around the house naked
386103 im still weirded out by the fact that they have no help
386104 phew i was nearly worried about simon being weirded out by help instead of jam but omid stawberry
386105 i e i don t see the help changing depending on any changing context of system use
386106 do u want to type up the results ian and email em out and i can wiki them
386107 guess thats the trouble with vitual birthday party in a text based environment
386108 ill get this done at work tomorrow and mail you all the link
386109 omid i see you dumped your essay into the overall wiki page
386110 other groups shoved theirs in a seperate page and made a link to it
386111 ok we done i need to do some stuff before bed
386112 you do tend to see a lot more ink on pop stars and film stars in the media
386113 the social stigma of tattoos is breaking down although you still come across it in places but its becoming far more socially acceptable
386114 things have changed really with the technological advances and the artists have really come on
386115 people are realising you dont have to just have a swallow or an anchor you can have beautiful fine art
386116 the number of studios in wales is phenomenal for the size of the country
386117 every month i hear of another studio opening up in wales more so in south wales though i dont know why
386118 i would say that the tattoo du jour is stars but i dont quite know the significance
386119 a while ago it was celtic work which was very popular in wales
386120 you see a lot of welsh flags and welsh dragons the welsh are very patriotic arent they
386121 as a first move in the exercise for cleaning the scheme a team of officials would be sent to rajasthan madhya pradesh and andhra pradesh to study their system of preparing muster rolls
386122 a team of officials would soon visit the three states to study the system and its impact with regard to honest implementation of the scheme we have heard it is rendering good results in making the muster roll more authentic
386123 the government will not tolerate any irregularity in the implementation of nrega prompt and unbiased action would be taken on any complaint
386124 you hear people say our universe is fine tuned for life that stars are rare and couldnt form if certain things were different

386179 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
386180 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
386181 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
386182 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
386183 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
386184 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
386185 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
386186 his nature was more primitive person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
386187 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
386188 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
386189 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
386190 today we learned barack obama has once again moved the way of the political winds trading in leadership and credibility for political expedience as he reversed his categorical opposition to offshore oil drilling
386191 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
386192 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
386193 im going to come at you like a spider monkey
386194 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory and he was going to take everybody out there with him
386195 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
386196 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
386197 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
386198 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
386199 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
386200 social networking sites are just another way that people say things or do things that come back and haunt them
386201 the things that people say online or leave online are pretty permanent

386204 i did feel that gave me some indication of how that young man was feeling a short time after a near fatal accident that he thought it was appropriate to joke and mock about the possibility of going to prison
386205 the pictures showed a kid who didnt know what to do two weeks after this accident
386206 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
386207 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support
386208 it is this imbedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
386209 terrorism in our region feed on a residual tradition of narrow minded politics and of pursuing out moded geo political interest
386210 for all citizens and of course the head of the government this individual generates a perfectly understandable feeling of contempt but we must respect the law
386211 over the next five games if we only won two of those i dont think the confidence is going to drop away either
386212 obviously they will try to shut the run down and it will a tight in close game
386213 a bit of a drudge and a bit of a chore sometimes for players
386214 but once you can see september once you hit august i think the enthusiasm starts to pick up again
386215 every team goes through a bit of a trough at some stage and we have the last two weeks but weve got no doubt well bounce back
386216 im probably not moving as well as i would like to but i was fairly in control of the match
386217 its important to create that three or four point lead and obviously i did that pretty well today

386263 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
386264 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
386265 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law

386267 theres a time and a place for quickies and that kind of orgasm is great but i prefer drawn out fuck sessions beginning with oral sex and leading on to pussy and then butt sex
386268 a session like that will give me four five or more orgasms lucky arent i mind you were talking perhaps a couple of hours so the guy if hes in decent shape should be able to manage two or three orgasms of his own i fantasize about having two or three guys at once and getting myself fucked and climaxed to total exhaustion
386269 im a real down to earth guy thats had a lot of problems in my life since birth
386270 i am a complicated guy theres too much to tell either love me or hate me but either way im me
386271 yeah its true it was me that cut the two girls but dat was a long time ago i have changed i just want a good life from now on and another chance
386272 they can move back in but we suggested they wait until the end of the weekend because were a bit uncertain about what this weather bomb that comes through tonight is going to be like
386273 if the slip were to start again we wouldnt want to put them at risk
386274 that being the case the people up the top probably wouldnt move back in until that work was done
386275 the poles have eased and are on a bit of a slope
386276 we know that many schools acknowledge their response to disabled students is limited by resourcing and other constraints it is clear that government policy does not allow all schools to do their best by disabled students
386277 the ministry of education has indicated to us that schools and boards of trustees are ultimately responsible for the problems not government and that government will defend much of the complaint on this basis such an approach will not solve this problem
386278 one of the biggest problems schools face is the lack of resources many schools have no choice but to limit attendance whenever support is unavailable parents are often asked to contribute financially to teacher aide hours because of a funding shortfall the only other option being that their son or daughter is sent home
386279 these problems have been with us for so long and have still not been addressed by the government
386280 children and young people are not being given an adequate education as guaranteed to them by new zealand law
386281 i thought it might get up the middle and it did
386282 but it so happened that our shortstop was all over it
386283 ochoa and burriss havent had the at bats that velez has had to this point
386284 we want to see more of them than eugenio well play a few games here and well have to decide whether to keep velez here or whether he should go down to triple a fresno and play
386285 it wouldnt serve any purpose to have him up here as a pinch runner or pinch hitter
386286 i was ecstatic about coming back here i look at myself as a giant but im in the odd man out category would it hurt me to not play down the stretch i dont know
386287 i heard the same thing when i played in cincinnati that nobody wanted me
386288 later on i heard that teams had claimed me and they took me off waivers its a tough time of year thats why i want to talk to sabean i want to see what these next couple months hold for me
386289 hell still get in there two or three times a week
386290 it might but i think i have a reputation that goes past my numbers
386291 i feel good and i want to give it a shot my hitting has improved and i can still pick it i dont think i really need to show anything
386292 selfishly we want a better record than we had last year
386293 thats something everybody should be striving for at least on a won loss basis it would show improvement
386294 ive been living and breathing skating everyday the last couple years not just skating when i felt like it
386295 when i first saw skate videos there was only one girl in them and it was elissa
386296 to be on the podium with her and competing on her level is awesome
386297 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
386298 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
386299 we still have depth issues and still have some age issues
386300 you look back at the starting front seven last year and they were nearly all freshmen or redshirt freshmen
386301 we will have some new people i dont think well have a unit this year like our front seven last year that will be so young they arent able to function
386302 he said are you ready to make a transition and i said yeah
386303 its always nice for your coach to know your name i feel blessed
386304 i feel like theres an opportunity for me to get some playing time early
386305 im just basically ready to hit the field and get the jitters off me im going into something i really dont know but im really excited
386306 i had worked in womens fashions before starting the site dealing with womens lingerie quite extensively and i felt i knew a lot about the subject
386307 i looked for good vendors with quality products and paid special attention to comfort and attractiveness for the items in my store i love working on the internet i like being in front of a computer and i feel completely at home managing my store
386308 i look for good quality good looking products things people would actually be interested in
386309 first ill purchase a few for myself to have a look at them and if i like them ill post them on my web site and offer them to my customers i want them to have a great selection to choose from and order products that theyll be happy with
386310 the blog is a way of communicating with future customers
386311 id like to present new product lines and explain whats new on the fashion scene for lingerie id like to help people choose new fashions and id like to inform my customers about lingerie from a professional perspective i want to make sure my customers are educated consumers and know what they are purchasing and why
386312 i hope to expand my inventory by moving from the lingerie into additional different types of fashions like accessories handbags perfumes and shoes
386313 i already add all kinds of new lingerie items as they come out on the market making certain theyre suitable for my shop the store is constantly growing and we think the next year will have some big additions

386319 other than making it easier for us to count and to carry around our problems have not gone away
386320 its like we are pretending that things are getting normal when the truth is that they are doing this introducing the new currency because we are in a bad state and far from normality
386321 what the country needs is a change in direction a change in policies that are affecting local and foreign investment and real respect for private property rights

386338 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

386355 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something

386361 this is not the time for a lot of hype
386362 its a time to actually go out and prove it
386363 if we didnt have the jugs machine wed just have the quarterback throw the ball as high as he can i was just running under it and catching it
386364 theyd throw the ball as high as they could and they have pretty strong arms for guys who just play receiver they want to see me do well
386365 i planted and ernie sims pushed me at the same time i planted so his weight combined with my weight on one leg just forced my knee to give out
386366 we thought it hit the back catwalk and dropped down
386367 there is no doubt in my mind you could tell the way the ball reacted and the way upton centerfielder b j upton reacted he just turned and watched and all of a sudden it was there it was a home run
386368 you have to be very fair it is a little bit of a unique place and those things can happen i thought they the umpires were very honest about it i thought they handled it very well they said they werent sure and they couldnt change it unless they were sure
386369 if i hadnt lost it i think i would have caught it

386385 im not really worried about the teams that made changes its a strong conference but im more concerned with how we continue to improve and how we improve as a team

386400 it helps when your alarm clock goes off at 5 in the morning to know that youre running with a cause
386401 its a terrible thing that happened but beau is inspiring people even while hes not here
386402 he wanted to do that in the classroom but now he is doing it in a completely different way that he never would have imagined
386403 were looking for a way to celebrate beaus life and when meg came to me it seemed like the perfect way to do that and we just wanted to offer as much help as possible
386404 hopefully we get a lot of people to come out and raise enough money for both the runner and beaus mom and hope some good comes out of it for raising awareness of violence and crime in philadelphia
386405 its weird in a way that i have a new connection to these kids
386406 i mean im not from philadelphia and most of these kids have had uncles or cousins who were shot and now its just a new way for me to reach out to them and say hey listen i may not look like you but i am sharing the same things going through the same thing youre going through and i hope to educate these kids about who beau was first off and secondly how important it is for them to stay in school and to not become a person who would do something like this
386407 it appeared that he had fallen or slipped and the gun discharged

386416 it goes to prove their intent to commit the crimes charged
386417 this gives jurors an accurate realistic impression of the government theory

386421 one of the most drastic things a judge can do
386422 my fear is that if i send this to the jury they might make a decision based on emotion or even more important they might be guessing what if anything had happened
386423 im sure my client and his family are very happy he will not be spending his entire life in prison
386424 he got a fair trial i dont see any errors on which to appeal
386425 how do you find third degree murder for killing a 14 year old kid
386426 if tykeem was white it wouldnt be like this if it was the other way around tykeem would have gotten first degree
386427 f no he shot and killed a little f ing kid thats why
386428 they rejected the idea that tykeem law was threatening anybody with his hands or under his shirt they said they had a long discussion about whether the one shot was meant to kill or was meant just to shoot him
386429 they concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that they could only agree that he meyers meant to injure him tykeem or cause serious bodily injury and not that he intended to kill him with that one shot
386430 i would have to strain beyond the bounds of reason to find the plea agreement reasonable
386431 i hope i never have a reason to see it
386432 this smashes the records for projects in a single year at the three bases
386433 the south jersey economy will benefit tremendously from new construction jobs and the new joint base itself will benefit from the modernization it needs to receive new missions

386446 cijfers van de deputaties per provincie tonen dat de eerste vijf maanden van dit jaar vergunningen werden uitgereikt voor een behoorlijke uitbreiding van de vlaamse veestapel 680 654 stuks pluimvee 66 410 varkens en 10 374 runderen
386447 de extra mestproductie ten gevolge van de vergunningen betekent een toename van de nitraatproductie met 2 8 miljoen kilo of een stijging met 1 8 procent de fosfaatproductie zou toenemen met 1 4 miljoen kilo of een stijging van 2 3 procent
386448 de 100 miljoen die door de vorige vlaamse regering werd ge nvesteerd in de afbouw van de veel te grote veestapel is dus weggesmeten geld

386462 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbours then the government would certainly act on that evidence
386463 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved
386464 these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
386465 we cannot afford to lose the battle against ideologies of hatred

386467 the conference will provide an excellent opportunity for national and international players in the industry to interact network and share views and resources
386468 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
386469 ultimately this will be important for our common efforts in addressing climate change issues
386470 we look forward for a clean and unconditional exemption and it is for the us to deliver as per the july 18 2005 statement
386471 i am hopeful that nsg will appreciate indias position and go ahead with the clean waiver
386472 of course in international affairs we have to wait till it happens on the ground level
386473 we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
386474 the countries acknowledge indias requirements and legitimacy of india asking for access to nuclear energy and they seem to acknowledge that this is in their benefit

386482 working with aparna and sharmila is most advantageous because one gets to absorb so much knowledge from them
386483 she is going to wow the audience in dil kabbadi the film explores a side of soha that audience has never seen before besides soha and konkana the film also stars irrfan khan and rahul khanna anil sharma is the director of dil kabbadi
386484 guidebooks help but most of our bookings come through internet listings on websites like hostelworld com
386485 what we get are stopovers they are either going to or from australia singapore and bangkok and they take in kl for an average of three to four days
386486 there still are pimps and all that but they dont cause problems for the rest of us the real trouble is drug addicts when we first started they were occupying all the abandoned houses here in fact the restaurant next door is a godsend as it has displaced the addicts but theyre still around the jaga kereta illegal carpark attendants who extort money from those who park here and if they cant get enough for their fix they will resort to stealing
386487 i prefer to have the dogs as they will let you know if there are strangers in the night
386488 i got into this after practising law and then working in advertising because this is what i really like
386489 we actually do get guests who arrive in suits and i have to ask you do realise this is a budget hostel right
386490 these were all homes and we set up shop here on the five foot way where im standing now was a drain but dbkl built an additional brick sidewalk
386491 come at 5am and see if i have business or not
386492 he doesnt use any chemicals or whatever and the fruit only comes according to the season
386493 we budget hotels help each other out but some of the big players with a lot of money have been opening three or four hostels and paying very high rental theyre spoiling the market
386494 a fan of proton cars and im sad to hear about proton in terengganu it is not the proton car that is bad the repair is not right
386495 it shouldnt happen they have taken six years of not only anwars life but our lives too
386496 but i think probably i also had the image that is not tainted as a wife of a minister and the deputy prime minister i dont think there were stories about me i am pretty much clean
386497 she was 17 she is my first born daughter all i heard was suddenly she was out of the country it wasnt told to me where she was going and what she was going to do
386498 i suddenly found out she was not at home and was overseas as a mother i felt worried i was already worried about her father i have to worry about her thats how i felt it was a bit difficult emotionally but after that i accepted it
386499 when i contested the first time they knew it was because anwar was in prison and when i contested the second time too because of the same reason and in 2008 anwar couldnt contest
386500 i wasnt really a fulltime housewife i was also a patron of many societies doing charity and voluntary work and i enjoy that sometimes of course i miss it because i like simple life
386501 invite our friends from across the floor to cross over and take over putrajaya
386502 since merdeka in 1957 until now this is the lowest point in our politics our image is the worst it has ever been the economy has no direction the world is laughing at us newspapers from indonesia thailand london america and the arab world are all publishing news of how bad things have become here
386503 they do this to me because i dare to stand up for the people and expose corruption in the government because i am seen as a challenger to them they say if you dare to challenge us these are the methods we will use because i am anwar ibrahim up to now i have not seen the police report accusing me of sodomy why because they have the report number but it has no contents so they can change it according to whatever statements i make
386504 they are saying he is not a specialist that he is not a sodomy doctor now the newspapers in england are writing that the worlds only sodomy doctor can be found in malaysia where is there such a thing as a sodomy or backside doctor
386505 have i not been dishonoured enough how about how azizah and my children feel if you have proof i will fight it now they dont have anything no witnesses and instead they detain the doctor for three days according to their whim and fancy
386506 why then was i made to fill up a rape victims report at the hospital
386507 next month when i want to contest the by election they might charge me with something else when we are going to putrajaya another
386508 it is for maybank to resolve their problems these are normal problems that occur in merger and acquisition deals im sure they are capable enough to resolve this issue
386509 once the rules change and backdated to cover maybank they have a right to look at it again as a regulator they have to look at it on a macro basis
386510 plans to become prime minister could be derailed even though he wins the by election
386511 a by election win will give him a firmer national footing but will not resolve the numerous challenges he faces
386512 he enters the by election with a mixed bag political victory is propelling him forward but the sodomy allegation and possible arrest are setback that will impact on the voters
386513 the plan for me to become prime minister by sept 16 malaysia day is on track
386514 the sodomy allegation will be the key issue in the by election
386515 anwar is hoping a victory will vindicate him before the people whatever the verdict of a future court it would be a spectacular propaganda coup if he is charged and he goes on to win
386516 its obvious what has happened here you dont need to be a rocket scientist
386517 i dont think malaysia can afford to have a prime minister who has a huge question mark hanging over his head is he or not involved in the murder of this girl
386518 desperate and pathetic attempt to discredit and taint my political image
386519 a good word is disgust whether its sodomy or blowing up the mongolian lady
386520 people just cannot trust the word of any of these people
386521 i think there will at some point be a crisis of legitimacy
386522 the leaders seem to feel that they can get away with a lot of things so long as the masses are satisfied with the economic opportunities given to them
386523 anwar has betrayed himself and the very people who support him he was a strong advocate of the new economic policy now he wants to abolish it granted there are corrupt politicians but why should we abolish the nep which is the basis of our constitutional rights
386524 anwar also tried to dilute islam whereas he proclaimed himself to be a champion of the religion why because he wanted to have the non malay support and well he got it in the last general election
386525 even if umno doesnt want me as the candidate for permatang pauh im willing to be in the constituency day and night to campaign for bn as well as to strip anwar of his populist claims
386526 if i contest im going to be the underdog i know its difficult to unseat anwar in his former constituency but its not about winning or losing its having the opportunity to face anwar and to tell the voters that they have been duped by the very man they revered
386527 if you notice anwar doesnt talk much about saiful actually its just a case between him and saiful who claimed that anwar had victimised him but anwar would rather tell his supporters that it is a battle between him and the government he must always be seen as a great man
386528 anwar has gone overboard he crossed the line and lost the statesmanship anwar lost all these in his pursuit for power
386529 people are not stupid even pas leaders have realised that i know there is a lot of resentment against anwar and pkr especially in selangor where the party is governing
386530 i know some people have accused pak lah of being politically weak but i see a strong resolve in that man he is serious about fighting corruption i might be wrong about the pm but at least he gives me the space to do something right for the country
386531 i will do it thats my commitment to umno if we dont clean up the party from bad elements how are going to reform society
386532 if you ask me what kind of image i want
386533 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
386534 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim

386551 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
386552 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
386553 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
386554 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
386555 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
386556 given good weather we are confident that the eisteddfod will generate up to 8m for the local economy
386557 the signs are very positive for attendances helped by the location of the eisteddfod site at pontcanna close to the city centre and also the fact that this years event is being held in the capital
386558 the interest can be illustrated by the fact the caernarfon based coach company silver star holidays is this year bringing more than twice the number of people they normally take to the eisteddfod
386559 the eisteddfod offers a fantastic opportunity for people from all over wales to visit their capital and hopefully many will come not only in august but return in the future
386560 a myth that circulates suggests that the eisteddfod is for welsh speakers only and that is completely wrong
386561 it belongs to the people of wales whether or not people speak welsh
386562 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt

386564 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
386565 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
386566 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go

386568 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
386569 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
386570 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
386571 the original book the thug who stole christmas by author waldorf caruthers is written in the new black on white crime sub genre of blaxploitation film noir so were hearing the perspective of the alleged killers
386572 i hear they have really gotten into their characters neither are new comers to the big screen the exciting thing is we get to see a side by side running comparison of the differences in their lives
386573 the darkest thing is the build that leads to the killing
386574 although theres no attempted rape the original crime or book the scripts enhanced with distressingly violent attempt where treach sexually assaults paris before killing her
386575 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
386576 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
386577 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
386578 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
386579 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor

386599 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
386600 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
386601 the scientific community is really going to run with this
386602 everyone of us is shadowed by a false self this is the man i want myself to be but who cannot exist because god does not know anything about him and to be unknown to god is altogether too much privacy my false and private self is the one who wants to exist outside the reach of gods will and gods love outside of reality and outside of life and such a self cannot help but be an illusion
386603 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
386604 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
386605 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses

386650 i get stared at i stick out with my own sense of style ive never dressed for anyone but myself
386651 im an equal opportunity shopper if i see a wonderful bag it could be a womans or a mans
386652 id use it as a carry on its not too too feminine but id open up the side snaps to be more boxy
386653 she is like charlie on charlies angels she is the voice of reason
386654 she is based on my mother who is retired and helps out in daycare she worked in external affairs and on the ontario film review board dad lives in new york and was a high ranking police officer who co founded the ontario race relations board
386655 we were brought up in modest means in a big house on three acres we were taught values and standards the value of money and the work ethic
386656 im a size 4 and i do not have hips
386657 i eat i just made brownies and i ate four or five i have a good relationship with food i give in to cravings i dont work out but i walk a lot ive danced all my life and i do the odd pilates class
386658 im mostly legs which makes it difficult to find pants to fit womens jeans fit best because they make them longer because they take into consideration stilettos a good pair of heels changes your whole world
386659 that was 10 years ago so long ago and so little
386660 i didnt work and got bored so i tended bar briefly at suede and then the spoke club
386661 jocelyn wanted to make a show based on my life
386662 id had offers before but i found this intriguing i was only at the spoke for fun im ridiculous shed never met anybody like me
386663 i had to get into a cage with four burmese pythons and had to clean up their feces and i had to feed these enormous snakes and i was not allowed to wear gloves it was only one shift but it was traumatizing then there was the crocodile he is six feet long and he doesnt blink you dont trip or turn your back on him because he is ready to eat you
386664 the bats were scary but the flying hissing brazilian cockroaches were horrible that was my first diva moment
386665 its a dirty job but with the goodness of the simple life
386666 i was with this bat emma at bird kingdom and i didnt get it tangled in my hair i kept my hood on and had lots of hairspray
386667 basically i shop for anything to do with dressing its not the shopping itself its the actual pieces i love to play dress up i was brought up to know the basics and classics both my parents are stylish my grandmother was a seamstress and a designer my entire family would consult me derek does this look okay my aunt is a model and my brother he has an older brother and younger sister is modelling
386668 i dont spend a lot of money on trends i spend on classics i have a uniform in the summer denim a low v neck t shirt or unbuttoned shirt sunglasses and flip flops or maybe a t shirt with blazer i like to tweak it up in winter i have big delicious boots and denim jeans i love jeans
386669 after accidentally touching something sticky on the door handle i rushed to wash off whatever foreign substance that i refused to give a name to only to find that every single dispenser was out of soap
386670 upon turning on the tap the water was cold and not coming out fast enough i did the best i could washing my hands but i dont think ill ever feel clean again
386671 i dont think any people will see the rats again in this restaurant we had not only pest control but animal experts come down here to track down the paths to the restaurant we do everything we can
386672 we are kind of a showcase in the front window we have nothing to hide
386673 as soon as i closed the washroom stall i noticed that a reshaped metal clothes hanger was hanging over the stall door holding the toilet paper after exiting the stall i walked to the sink to wash my hands
386674 there were two sinks both without taps only metal pipes remained where taps were once affixed in place of taps there was a green garden hose protruding through a tile in the suspended ceiling the hose was strategically placed over one of the sinks and a stream of cold water flowed out
386675 i gingerly placed my hands under the hose and rinsed them as well as i could at this point i knew it would be fruitless to search for a soap dispenser there was a cloth of unknown origin on the sink that some brave restaurant patrons may have used to dry their hands but i was not that brave
386676 the restroom incident has not made us shy away from interesting restaurants but sometimes we check the restrooms first
386677 as for the location of this restroom all who have used it know where it is and for the rest of you just keep dining and you will eventually discover it
386678 this is one of the best burritos youll ever have in this city
386679 these guys work long and hard hours they need good healthy food its good for morale
386680 ive worked in restaurants where you get the dregs some love should go into it
386681 its kind of an old rustic way of using things up
386682 pasta is more common but its always good were very spoiled
386683 sometimes you do something from your background to give a taste of where youre coming from
386684 staff meals are one of those pains in the neck its that thorn in your side
386685 but what it does is it trains you to go a lot faster to organize yourself better some days are busier than others so you tend to be less creative
386686 i was born and baptized and bred in a pretty staunch catholic upbringing
386687 its when you get into conversations with mom and you ask why is the sky blue
386688 i asked whats going to happen to howie goldstein when he dies
386689 im thinking wait a minute they seem like a pretty nice family
386690 why would god create a bunch of people and just because they have different beliefs punish them forever
386691 the last thing i want is to make a bunch of converts to atheism
386692 it doesnt bother me that people are religious or spiritual up until it moves them to do something that harms others
386693 the number just keeps going up or at least the number of people willing to come out of the closet is going up
386694 i had a friend who was very religious and said im going to pray for you
386695 i said its okay you dont need to pray for me
386696 and i am a good person im a very caring person i care for my cats and other people

386698 short term we raise social costs until elites agree to implement our demands or end policies we oppose longer term we accumulate support and develop movement infrastructure and alternative institutions while working toward transforming societys defining relations
386699 there is considerable violence likely during the whole preparatory series of struggles leading up to the actual final seizure of power but the seizure itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful
386700 the seizure of power itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful
386701 we cannot accept a health care system in which 42 percent of americans under age 65 are uninsured or underinsured
386702 we must pursue a workable solution that mixes private and public coverage well before the majority of americans find themselves with no coverage or with coverage that has been chipped away until it no longer serves its purpose
386703 continued rapid growth in the intensity and utilization of part b services is the primary reason for the premium increase this growth is seen in physician office visits lab tests minor procedures and physician administered drugs it also includes rapid growth in hospital outpatient services additionally increased fee for service expenditures contribute to higher payment rates to medicare advantage health plans also enrollment in medicare advantage plans is increasing as those plans have become much more widely available these factors are leading to higher medicare costs related to the medicare advantage program
386704 some of these increases in use of services are unquestionably related to improvements in the quality of health care however as noted in the medpac letter and in subsequent analysis by cms and other groups much of the spending increase cannot easily be explained by changes in treatments based on new medical evidence and valuable new technologies as cms has said repeatedly the rapid growth in utilization of services shows that medicare needs to move away from a system that pays simply for more services regardless of their quality or impact on beneficiary health medicare payments should provide better financial support to doctors and other health professionals in their efforts to achieve better health outcomes for medicare beneficiaries at a lower cost cms is working closely with medical professionals and congress to increase the effectiveness of how medicare compensates physicians and other health care providers cms is also conducting demonstrations and pilot programs that pay providers more for better quality better patient satisfaction and lower overall health care costs
386705 t he findings presented here are consistent with other cross national analyses demonstrating the relative underperformance of the u s health care system in several key indicators compared with other industrialized countries
386706 i wouldnt say it the last place ranking is a condemnation because i think health care in the u s is pretty good if you have access but if you dont i think thats the main problem isnt it
386707 it is startling to see the u s falling even farther behind on this crucial indicator of health system performance the fact that other countries are reducing these preventable deaths more rapidly yet spending far less indicates that policy goals and efforts to improve health systems make a difference
386708 a pessimistic view of grief counseling has emerged over the last 7 years exemplified by r
386709 nearly 38 of recipients of grief counseling theoretically would have fared better if assigned to the no treatment condition
386710 despite frequent claims to the contrary there is no empirical or statistical evidence to suggest that grief counseling is harmful to clients or that clients who are normally bereaved are at special risk if they receive grief counseling larson and hoyt found that the data on which these negative views are based have never been published and came from a student dissertation that was never peer reviewed using a statistical technique attributed to another students masters thesis also never peer reviewed
386711 one factor that made the tide claims resistant to critical review was the practice of citing neimeyers peer reviewed summary article rather than fortners dissertation which contained the data on which the claims were based the phrase novel statistical procedure which to a methodologist may be a red flag appears in this instance to have leant added legitimacy to the findings among statistically na ve readers if readers and even reviewers lack the statistical training to evaluate new methodologies this greatly enhances the chances for invalid findings or misinterpretations of valid findings to enter the published literature
386712 participating not in the conventions of scientific scholarship but rather in a sort of grown up version of the childrens game of telephone in this game receivers later in the chain of communication never hear directly from the source but only from those just preceding them in the chain in the grown up version of the game just as in the childrens version there is every likelihood of serious distortion of the original message
386713 come from genuine proponents of a single payer plan or those using single payer as an organizing tool disappointment over the improbability of single payer ever being enacted anytime in the foreseeable future should not be allowed to diminish the benefits millions of californians will receive from the california plan
386714 creates structural building blocks that rationalize the health care system and therefore would make a transition to single payer easier

386916 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory and he was going to take everybody out there with him
386917 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
386918 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
386919 he kicked him and knocked him to the ground punching him numerous times
386920 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
386921 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
386922 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
386923 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
386924 his nature was more primitive person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute

386948 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
386949 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
386950 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
386951 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
386952 for all citizens and of course the head of the government this individual generates a perfectly understandable feeling of contempt but we must respect the law
386953 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
386954 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
386955 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
386956 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
386957 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
386958 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

386970 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
386971 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
386972 adds to the case that the u s is in recession
386973 companies have already cut the fat and some muscle and are now trimming hours
386974 generally temporary staffing is a leading indicator of overall employment growth and decline
386975 then when corporations feel comfortable about the sustainability of their profit levels they start to hire permanently
386976 companies are hanging onto permanent workers much longer than they have in past cycles
386977 it is the front line performers who are having a tough time in the economy
386978 it will take time but we are resolved to keep the projects they dedicated themselves to on target
386979 we also resolve to always remember marc and alan their work will be a legacy to the kind of people they were dedicated hard working and genuinely two of the best people any of us here at apg international ever had the pleasure of knowing

387030 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
387031 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
387032 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state but it is likely that they were assembled here since items like batteries and watches are found locally we believe that the assembly could have been done here
387033 the boards approval of the safeguards agreement is a key step forward in implementing the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
387034 the historic initiative was welcomed by the iaea director general mohammad elbaradei as a milestone in the ongoing efforts to strengthen the non proliferation regime combat nuclear terrorism and strengthen nuclear safety
387035 while it might seem reasonable that the average stock market return over the last 50 years is a logical estimate for what the next 50 years may hold there is a large range of error in the historical average
387036 it is critically important to remember that investment decisions should be based on what is possible not just on what has transpired in the past
387037 why the more models you test the more likely you are to find a spurious fit to the historical data
387038 krishnan was saddled with vast foreign exchange denominated debts because of purchases of imported telecommunications broadcasting and satellite equipment but he had unrivalled access to mahathir

387043 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
387044 we look forward for a clean and unconditional exemption and it is for the us to deliver as per the july 18 2005 statement
387045 i am hopeful that nsg will appreciate indias position and go ahead with the clean waiver
387046 of course in international affairs we have to wait till it happens on the ground level
387047 it is a historic event and a big step towards the final approval by us congress it will provide india additional source of energy which it desperately needs
387048 we are hopeful that india will get unanimous approval from the 45 member nuclear supplier group no doubt there are some challenges in the second and third steps time is of the essence for ratification of 123 agreement by us congress

387053 caribana could be looked at as one of the festivals that defines ethnic toronto
387054 it would be nice in an ideal world to have it include a continental african perspective but i dont see it happening soon im not sure thats what they want to do to be honest
387055 one has to consider the ownership by the people who started this almost 40 years ago
387056 caribana is very very diverse south americans south asians and southeast asians indians and pakistanis are well represented how else would we have the kind of varied audiences that we have without getting that diverse message across
387057 the perpetrators of this crime do not share this communitys sense of non violent behaviour and tolerance of all people from every walk of life
387058 there appear to have been racial overtones and that makes this incident something that needs to be addressed
387059 i hope this may be a stimulus to try to assist such people
387060 it took people from a lot of cultures and a lot of colours
387061 well we decided a long time ago that parkland should be prime land in a good location
387062 people move to oakville because of the ambience of the old buildings then want to tear them down and put up something else
387063 the whole property would be privately owned of course that is contrary to every bylaw in that area
387064 theres a lot of construction going on and the homes keep getting larger and larger
387065 it sat idle for a long long time and unfortunately nature wasnt very good to it
387066 when canadians give their household trash over to the municipality for waste management and recycling they believe thats what the municipality is going to do with it
387067 they dont expect and would be offended to learn that the police or other law enforcement agencies can intercept our trash and mine our personal information to investigate us
387068 to make the call about core human rights that affect everyone
387069 what were seeing more and more is that people think they have privacy in their homes but theres more emanation out of our homes like garbage or information that goes out on your computer that is the subject of search and seizure by state authorities
387070 cant help but give off information b ut does that mean the state always has a right to collect it
387071 i think if you store your garbage in your garage and police receive information about the garbage relevant to their investigation they would need a warrant that would make sense
387072 anyone living in a major metropolitan area knows that once garbage is left for pickup it may be subject to disturbance by bottle collectors and others looking for discarded treasures as well as birds dogs and vermin
387073 important parts of the evidence tendered against the defendants at the preliminary hearing and at trial have been found by the court to be unreliable likely false
387074 i quite simply do not believe the evidence of the officers
387075 when officer self interest and or the bond of the thin blue line is challenged as in a disciplinary proceeding overt lying is widely recognized as a common occurrence
387076 police knowingly give false testimony to facilitate the prosecution and to ensure the conviction of persons the police know are guilty because police so easily get away with noble cause perjury police quite reasonably believe that they are being encouraged to lie by the administration of justice itself
387077 you would expect police witnesses to have a stronger regard for the oath but people lie in court all the time police officers included
387078 there is an attitude that the legal system is just a bunch of bulls invented by lawyers and the oath doesnt really bind anyones conscience in some quarters im not saying every cop is like that but ive certainly had the impression over the years that there are many that do feel that way
387079 theres a world of difference between saying im not satisfied sufficiently to deprive somebody of their liberty based on the evidence and the officers are outright liars
387080 even when sufficient evidence exists and apparently only when a defence lawyer catches them lying and it makes the front page of the newspapers
387081 i sent a package off to internal affairs nothing was ever done
387082 no ones aggressively going after anyone and at the end of the day nothing happens
387083 theres no apathy at all were very concerned about comments made by judges
387084 we thoroughly looked into the entire matter and it was determined that there was no evidence to support either criminal or police services act charges
387085 its only in the most clearest of cases when the evidence is there
387086 after 108 years the fresh air fund continues to grow giving underprivileged children and children with special needs a summer they will remember throughout their lives
387087 this year with the help of star readers we supported the highest number in our charitys history
387088 im hoping we can help even more camps next summer and in the summers to come so more kids can be given this wonderful opportunity in life
387089 at camp i learned how to do things for myself
387090 i am comfortable and very confident with the advice we provide the regulators
387091 we have to make it clear to people these precautionary approaches are not using new scientific evidence that there is a risk and they are a little alarmist in nature
387092 in respect to our report we did not involve industry representatives in reviewing the evidence we choose to look at scientific evidence and review the evidence of others we urge people to be cautious
387093 one of my interests in being on the committee is trying to get a sense of what direction the industry wants to go in terms of their products
387094 its as if the referee were also coach of one of the teams
387095 should not step out of their official roles to assist private entities or persons in their dealings with the government where this would result in preferential treatment to the entities or persons
387096 when you are sitting on an industry association committee as a member you have stepped out of your official role
387097 i attend the health council meeting in a liaison capacity only i do not have influence on the agenda and do not participate in any decision making capacity with this group
387098 the question of potential conflict of interest was reviewed before i agreed to participate my participation was approved at the time
387099 industry canada ic participates in the cwta health committee as an observer and government liaison only such participation from ic is in line with the departments participation in any other industry associations related to radiocommunications in canada

387102 everybodys walking around with the same kind of confused sadness
387103 no matter what the whole background is its a sad story and a sad outcome
387104 its a very sad occasion for his family and our hearts go out to his family
387105 obviously its sad and its tragic and everybodys very sorry for his family its also true that the neighbourhood was subject to these tire slashings for a period of 18 months that was also terrifying
387106 the bad air will come back after the games are finished
387107 beijing could have adopted clean production measures more widely across the municipality to speed up the improvement of air quality and to ensure that standards are met for the whole year
387108 to the surprise of many western journalists we would say the government is 95 per cent on track with their targets
387109 when there is no watchdog the government can do pretty much what it wants and it has done a great job of silencing environmental groups
387110 last year not a single day during the olympic period met the agreed upon world health organisation guidelines for air quality
387111 through july 21 i believe there has only been two days that have met the who guidelines but the efforts to improve air quality are being heralded by the chinese government as a success
387112 when there is no watchdog the government can do pretty much what it wants and it has done a great job of silencing environmental groups
387113 they have been relying on technological fixes and they have put a lot of money into this to get the environment clean but they didnt realise citizen power is very important to safeguarding beijings environment
387114 to accurately gauge how successful beijings environmental initiatives have been
387115 i hope the air quality will improve after the olympics but since it hasnt improved in the build up to the olympics i am not optimistic
387116 im just guessing but someone must have said to her you better get your act together or else
387117 she was perfect and shes a really good actress im not just saying that because of the movie but she really happens to be talented and it looks like shes ok now

387347 you look for the bottom line a lot of times he has to work hard for saves bottom line is he got it its an important step for him hes important to us for him to get that first one out of the way i think its a step forward

387349 when i started to gulp it was already in alberts glove
387350 i go out there now as hard as i can for as long as i can
387351 who knows what tomorrow brings thats how i look at it thats how i have to look at it now with thats happened this year that is all i can do prove i should do it again
387352 we came up for the trip last year like we always do
387353 and for all intents and purposes i died out there in left field

387355 alles ist offen man kann alles was man will mit an bord nehmen oder im gep ckraum verstauen ich wundere mich dass nicht noch mehr passiert
387356 he had some good games against the usa and was real brash about it trash talked things of that nature
387357 this is what i do they the u s coaches reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
387358 we really do not want to create a scandal supporting one thing and then receiving evidence to the contrary
387359 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the u s olympic team as possible
387360 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
387361 given additional time to investigate possible causes of her positive drug test
387362 i have been told by people within the usoc and usa swimming that usa swimming knew about the positive drug test before the entry deadline on july 21 i deserved to have honesty and transparency from usa swimming
387363 for us to win this game were going to rely heavily on them
387364 a loss would almost eliminate us at this point just in terms of morale
387365 i dont think we could afford to go down another six points to this team
387366 but at this point our club needs to get a win wherever possible whether its in oakland santa clara or san francisco
387367 check obtain head henchman alright craig find me a head henchman
387368 blondie b ombshell no i dont think im quite the caliber of villain for a female head hench person

387372 it was magic he called me last night i didnt know you were so fast
387373 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
387374 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
387375 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
387376 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
387377 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
387378 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
387379 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
387380 it is the artist not the critic who gives society something of lasting value
387381 its important for internet users and american consumers in general to understand what information is being collected about them and how its being used
387382 hay una ley hay que cumplir la ley y el resto son sugerencias
387383 es muy dif cil que el congreso vuelva a sesionar para tratar esos temas
387384 esa resoluci n de la corte nacional es s lo un ave mar a para sacramentar la posici n del gobierno nacional
387385 well see what happens at the end of the summer

387388 there really isnt much industrial stuff very few metals no pcbs

387391 buoys and nets have been installed to indicate the supervised area
387392 as a result of the harbour cleanup specific water and sediment quality testing shows levels that are well within acceptable guidelines for both swimming and recreational contact

387394 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
387395 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
387396 well call first because we have to give them to live people
387397 usually its because of a menacing dog wandering the street and the carriers walking
387398 they said well forever maintain this as the peoples home
387399 its ready for another 100 years for future governors but more importantly for the people
387400 it is fine fettle and ready to serve another 100 years or more
387401 in 1909 the legislature passed an amendment to grant women the right to vote
387402 lacey is going to be a growth area and economically strong as well
387403 when you have established a relationship between two political entities youre going to have some conversations about developing business opportunities
387404 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
387405 i still dont go over the mississippi here in minnesota that i dont look down and remember and pray
387406 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
387407 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
387408 there are a lot of unanswered questions that theyve managed to not answer
387409 we supports the south florida water management district and have confidence that the district has operated within the public record laws of florida
387410 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
387411 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
387412 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations
387413 agrees with the inspector generals recommendations and as noted in the report itself has already taken steps to better monitor and assess grants to combat human trafficking and to better track data related to the number of human trafficking victims identified and served
387414 human trafficking grant programs have built significant capacities to serve victims but have not identified and served significant numbers of victims
387415 currently under investigation and will be charged with 5 capital murders
387416 i didnt want to stay in hospital my place was with the boys
387417 my first thoughts after the crash went to them because theyve worked so hard for the last couple of weeks we now have to perform strongly in the race thats the only correct way to thank them
387418 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
387419 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
387420 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
387421 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as
387422 landed without incident after the captain became aware that the aircraft had a hydraulic leak
387423 on inspection engineers determined that fluid was coming from the spoiler actuator that was not evident before departure
387424 het is een totaal nieuwe soort er is nog niets geschreven over deze zeebewoners
387425 we hebben zes jaar geleden ontdekt dat er water op mars was maar voor het eerst hebben we het kunnen analyseren
387426 dat is echt heel weinig voor een film van 90 minuten
387427 het is een totaal nieuwe soort er is nog niets geschreven over deze zeebewoners
387428 we hebben zes jaar geleden ontdekt dat er water op mars was maar voor het eerst hebben we het kunnen analyseren
387429 dat is echt heel weinig voor een film van 90 minuten
387430 bsirske agiert nach dem motto links reden rechts leben eigentlich m sste er jetzt zur cktreten er hat seine leute w hrend des arbeitskampfes im stich gelassen
387431 herr bsirske soll in der s dsee bleiben wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
387432 das verhalten ist unglaublich ich fordere herrn bsirske auf sein aufsichtsrats mandat bei lufthansa niederzulegen
387433 we have tanks bradleys paladins we are a conventional force if the united states went to war against a conventional enemy
387434 but because we arent going against a conventional enemy and were doing a counterinsurgency mission we had to refocus our training
387435 when we got the initial notice back in october we changed the entire training plan and have been conducting modular training in preparation of this in preparation of fort mccoy in preparation of moving forward
387436 we literally have to know two different jobs these days
387437 now were being told to drop everything we know and learn a whole other job
387438 even though we were mechanics they had us go out and do a lot of this training here
387439 its really not too much of a transition for me
387440 craigslist really has our attention right now because of the juveniles
387441 you want to get them into the system and intervene in whats going on or its going to be too late
387442 we will continue to find ways to track and arrest those who would use and abuse kids for profit and for perverse thrills
387443 when this crime is carried out on the internet we will go there to find violators and to rescue kids
387444 i was just trying to tell them but being circumspect on it
387445 i had no intent to mislead them and i never asked anyone to mislead them
387446 went out for drinks and there was a flirtation and you know something about dating quote unquote and text messages
387447 add to that or if they would support that version
387448 an attempt to influence the statements and testimony of potential witnesses in a commission proceeding
387449 failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary
387450 reasonably appeared to be an effort to conceal her misconduct by misleading the commission and by suggesting other potential witnesses withhold relevant information
387451 be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it
387452 respondents actions resulted in denying a criminal defendant his right to free exercise of religion in her courtroom
387453 the only issue is whether the adherent believes that a given practice is part of their sincere faith
387454 a judges honest but mistaken application of the law does not usually result in judicial discipline
387455 in this instance however respondent failed to consider settled law as well as a recent public commission disciplinary order in re ladenburg on this very issue
387456 we have public involvement at home but since our settlement is new were still learning how to get major public involvement
387457 because their resources are short ours are short we find ourselves like them wearing many hats
387458 what i learned is theyve made a lot of progress over there
387459 throughout our sessions we repeated so many times we have that same problem
387460 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
387461 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
387462 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
387463 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
387464 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
387465 hey so how are things going with you how is your job whats been going on with your life lately is your brother feeling better did you take care of that problem you were having with your cousin how is class going anything new going on with your career

387474 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
387475 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
387476 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
387477 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
387478 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
387479 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
387480 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
387481 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
387482 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
387483 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
387484 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
387485 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
387486 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
387487 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
387488 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
387489 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
387490 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
387491 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
387492 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
387493 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
387494 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
387495 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
387496 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
387497 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
387498 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
387499 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
387500 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
387501 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
387502 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
387503 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
387504 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
387505 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
387506 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
387507 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
387508 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
387509 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
387510 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
387511 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
387512 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
387513 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
387514 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
387515 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
387516 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
387517 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
387518 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
387519 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
387520 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
387521 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
387522 sixteen palestinians were wounded this morning in an exchange of fire as hamas tried to arrest those allegedly behind the bomb attack
387523 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
387524 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm
387525 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children

387532 jill shalvis is a breath of fresh air on a hot humid night
387533 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
387534 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
387535 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
387536 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
387537 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
387538 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
387539 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
387540 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
387541 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
387542 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
387543 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
387544 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
387545 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
387546 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
387547 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
387548 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
387549 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
387550 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
387551 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
387552 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
387553 who are open to doing something on the production side
387554 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
387555 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
387556 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
387557 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
387558 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
387559 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
387560 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
387561 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
387562 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
387563 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
387564 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
387565 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
387566 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
387567 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
387568 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

387572 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
387573 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

387601 both sides believe there is something called the master narrative
387602 yes there is an abundance of voices and sources trying to influence that master narrative but it does finally get set and once its set its virtually impossible to change so everyone is doing their best to stop the master narrative from setting in a way that disadvantages their side
387603 da es etwas gibt das sie das master narrative nennen gewi gibt es eine flut von stimmen und quellen die dieses master narrative zu beeinflussen suchen aber irgendwann ist es etabliert und wenn es erst einmal etabliert ist dann ist es so gut wie unm glich es wieder zu ndern folglich tut jeder was er kann um zu verhindern da das master narrative sich zum nachteil der eigenen seite etabliert

387634 no cause for concern in the way that community restorative justice ireland schemes now operate
387635 a substantive basis on which the secretary of state should not accredit community restorative justice schemes
387636 the balance between risks and opportunities has moved in favour of the restorative justice schemes
387637 any decision to accredit and fund is a political one driven by the need of republicans
387638 the nio has been given a mountain of evidence as to why the criminal justice inspectors report is flawed on many issues including complaints to accredit and fund restorative justice ireland flies in the face of this evidence
387639 the first thing is the concept is a good one but it depends on who you get involved in it and theres always a perception that its an alternative to the police and its not
387640 i dont know this individuals circumstances but it does suggest that there are problems with this process and thats very unhelpful in our current political climate
387641 the minister is satisfied that the chief inspector of criminal justice and his staff have been unambiguous in inspecting community restorative justice ireland crji schemes against the very high standards of the published government protocol inspection schemes go forward to the next stage of the process where an independent panel determines on a case by case basis if individuals meet the exacting standards required for those working in an accredited scheme this process is on going

387666 kak mira maafkan azma azma yang pandai pandai pinjamkan buku kak mira kepada
387667 cikgu mat nor dah ambil cikgu kata dia nak mia fortuna sendiri yang pergi jumpa dia untuk ambil buku tu
387668 tanya cikgu mat nor pada mira ketika mira menghampiri mejanya
387669 soal cikgu mat nor lagi kehairanan beliau membanding bandingkan nama mia fortuna dengan nama yang tertera di tag nama mira
387670 cikgu mia fortuna tu nama samaran saya saya suka menulis cerita dengan menggunakan nama samaran
387671 itu semua saya tak tahu cikgu inilah akibatnya bila orang yang saya pinjamkan buku itu meminjamkannya pula kepada orang lain di luar pengetahuan saya saya dah pesan kepada setiap peminjam baca buku saya hanya bila berada di
387672 hmmmm mira suka tak kalau cikgu tawarkan untuk menjadi ahli sidang editor majalah sekolah kita
387673 apa sebabnya cikgu nak tawarkan jawatan dalam sidang editor kepada saya yang tak punya apa apa ini
387674 mira mira cikgu dah habis baca skrip novel kamu syabas mira
387675 kerja karang mengarang tu bukannya boleh bawa ke mana mana
387676 tidak cikgu saya cuma masih kurang yakin pada diri sendiri jika saya ada bakat seperti kata cikgu sekalipun hendak ke manalah bakat saya ini dimanfaatkan dalam alam nyata yang serba serbi mementingkan rm dan yang lebih mengutamakan sains dan teknologi ini cikgu
387677 soalan yang mira tanya pada cikgu tadi sebenarnya bukan soalan nombor satu
387678 jadi sebelum cikgu jawab soalan mira mira kena faham terlebih dulu apa dia sains dan apa dia sastera dan kedua duanya perkara yang sama sama penting dalam hidup kita apa yang mira lihat dalam kehidupan kita sekarang sebenarnya berpunca dari kegagalan manusia untuk memahami sains dan sastera sebagai elemen kehidupan yang tidak boleh dipisah pisahkan kedua duanya umpama adik beradik kembar yang sama tapi tak serupa tidak boleh dilayan secara pilih kasih
387679 mira tidaklah cikgu nafikan bahawa ilmu sains itu mengkaji bagaimana allah mentadbirkan alam ini ke arah yang satu mengenali dia lalu membuat keyakinan dan kecintaan kita pada allah semakin teguh tapi tanpa disertai ilmu tentang cara manusia mentadbir dunia ini kehidupan manusia ini jadi kering dan tidak seimbang ilmu tentang itu perlu untuk mengkaji dan memahami cara mereka berfikir dan merasakan sesuatu juga cara mereka bertindak kerana manusia sebagai makhluk telah ditakdirkan mempunyai cara mentadbir yang berbeza beza lalu manusia sendiri boleh saling bersetuju untuk menyatukan manusia yang saling berbeza antara satu sama lain atas peraturan yang telah disediakan pentadbir yang maha berkuasa dan sastera itu adalah satu dari aplikasi ilmu cara kerja manusia yang ada banyak cabang itu
387680 jika manusia tidak menjaga hubungan baiknya dengan allah dan hubungan baiknya dengan manusia agar kedua duanya seimbang kehidupan manusia akan berjalan serupa orang tempang
387681 yalah cikgu bersikap berat sebelah terhadap sains dan sastera tu samalah macam bersikap berat sebelah dalam habluminallah dan habluminannas sains memperkukuh hubungan manusia dengan allah sementara sastera itu menjadi jambatan yang memperkukuhkan hubungan sesama manusia yang akhirnya hubungan kukuh itu menjadi jalan memperolehi redha allah lalu mengukuhkan lagi hubungan manusia dengan allah umpama dua kaki untuk manusia memudahkan pergerakan pendek salah satunya pincanglah jawabnya betul tak cikgu
387682 mira meminati serta menyayangi dunia penulisan dan sastera tidak bererti mira harus membuang aliran sains dan teknologi jauh jauh kedua dua perkara boleh berjalan seiringan tak kira ketika mira masih belajar atau sudah bekerja asalkan mira tahu membahagikan masa lihat kawan kamu sairah dan nuha mereka juga pelajar sains seperti mira tetapi mereka rajin menulis juga karya mereka sudah pernah disiarkan di majalah untuk pelajar cikgu suka kalau mira dapat bersama sama mereka dalam sidang editor
387683 ada banyak lagi penulis seperti ahmad patria abdullah di luar sana jangan terkejut jika seorang doktor pakar gigi pun menjadi seorang penyair
387684 profesor dato dr hashim yaacob beliau sekarang sudah menjadi naib canselor di universiti malaya
387685 mira usah ragu ragu lagi cikgu akan berusaha meningkatkan keyakinan mira terhadap bakat mira sendiri pasal imbalan cikgu sendiri akan membantu mira dengan menghantar skrip novel mira ini untuk diterbitkan oleh mana mana penerbit yang berminat cikgu yakin dengan bakat yang mira ada tidak ada penerbit yang akan menolaknya
387686 mira tanpa kesedaran untuk mencintai bahasa sastera dan budaya yang berakar dari kepercayaan kepada yang maha kuasa kecanggihan teknologi dan kemajuan ekonomi tiada erti malah lebih banyak membinasakan sesuatu bangsa dan tamaddun berbanding membinanya mira sekarang dah sedar akan semua itujadi mira ada amanah yang besar untuk menyedarkan mereka

387737 it felt good to put that footage in front of everybody here were only half way through principal photography so i wanted to make sure we were on the right track
387738 and to get that response really galvanised our efforts made us feel like we were doing the right thing
387739 people have been asking for months about when its going to happen
387740 so as soon as it does go up the fans go nuts for it and they tear apart every little part of it its become a huge phenomenon immediately looking at trailers online
387741 it used to be that a trailer was an advert for the film now its an event in itself and as soon as they go online people are clicking on them and discussing them
387742 we have for many years premiered trailers with broadcast partners it is a great way to promote the fact that a trailer is about to land in cinemas
387743 the immediacy and reach of the internet however enables studios to reach a global audience simultaneously with this message and for it to proliferate further over time
387744 we are using the internet as an increasingly significant broadcast channel
387745 when they go up with a partner site it is very difficult to then control the proliferation
387746 planning in advance how and when it is distributed has to be thought out very clearly and strategically
387747 they have to use it cannily if they have a major high profile movie there is going to be a teaser trailer
387748 further down the line they will tell the story in a pay off trailer they then shorten it to get more exposure in the cinemas and thats called a cross plug trailer
387749 it was being talked about everywhere and it has hardly any dialogue just these beautiful images

387759 well women peek in their early 20s and men peak in their 50s and he gave me this look
387760 does this guy think any ordinary trade in merits a story
387761 well when we win games thats when we feel better
387762 thats probably never going to change we show up every day to win a game and when we win we feel better
387763 theres a way to go about winning and we talked about that today
387764 we just kind of reminded all of ourselves about that today
387765 i dont think thats fair were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a contributing member of a winning baseball team
387766 if that ball couldve snuck out for me it wouldve been better
387767 i wouldve like to have done it in nine innings because its been a long day but it doesnt matter really
387768 it definitely ranks up there as one of the better moments ive had
387769 i think he had a pretty good heartbeat going anyway
387770 this place continues to amaze me the way the fans welcomed him you only see that here
387771 the trade will take care of itself through time but we still have other parts that we have to solidify we have to pitch the ball well and play good defense as we do that itll give our offense a chance to get going
387772 we have direction on what our team is and where we need to go
387773 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
387774 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
387775 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
387776 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
387777 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
387778 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
387779 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

387813 the minister when he took office he made sure crown corporations under his watch would show accountability and taxpayers dollars would be well invested

387878 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
387879 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
387880 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination

387981 anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job
387982 given the continuing uncertainty we can understand why it makes sense for borrowers to lock in to longer term deals so that they can plan their future and have a degree of stability and security theyre opting to take a deal and then sit out the mortgage merry go round until it settles down
387983 the focus for borrowers should still be on the true cost of their loan taking into account all fees as well as the monthly payments the mortgage market will settle down eventually and interest rates may fall so there will be a cost for security
387984 we used to think that meeting face to face was the only way to build trust and teamwork armed with new technology and new best practices were learning new ways to connect on a human level with people anywhere anytime

387989 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

387991 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
387992 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
387993 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
387994 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
387995 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

388063 but on a trip abroad i became conscious of the fact that health juice bars which were a common fixture in the west werent exploited in india
388064 i found myself a retail store that was strategically located close to a couple of prominent gyms in mumbai
388065 it took several months and many free juice samples to get the taste right we wanted our customers to realise that our protein shakes and smoothies were complete meals and not just a thirst quenching source
388066 there are special fruits and herbs that can be blended into your protein shake to cure health disorders without spoiling the taste

388075 we find the actions of university of minnesota morris professor paul myers reprehensible inexcusable and
388076 the founding fathers did not envision a freedom from religion rather a freedom of religion
388077 the freedom of religion means that no one has the right to attack malign or grossly offend a faith tradition they personally do not have membership or ascribe allegiance

388079 i am catholic i find homosexuality offensive to my religion there is a homosexual who is not catholic therefore they have no right to be homosexual they are violating my rights
388080 individual freedoms are limited by the boundaries created by the inalienable rights of others
388081 that inalienable right being the right not to be or even to feel offended by others their own words not mine

388083 the asking rate for an ad spot on dd1 which will telecast the inaugural and finale ceremonies is around rs 60 000 while the rates for spots during the highlights are rs 10 000 and rs 20 000 however brands who buy commercial time on dd sports will be given free commercial time on dd national and dd news
388084 however since the property is relatively less expensive and given the downturn in the economy brands that have low ad budgets or have cut down on their budgets may eventually pick up a few spots

388121 god zegt niet alleen ja tegen ons hij zegt ook nee dat is het ongemakkelijke van geloven altijd al hield het geloof een breuk in abraham trok weg uit zijn land dat is een oerbeeld van geloven ik heb er moeite mee dat het vervreemdende en storende wat bij geloven hoort vandaag dreigt te vervlakken
388122 dan gaat het dus niet zomaar over god maar over een heel bepaalde god met wie we allereerst kennismaken in de kruisdood van jezus god heeft een gezicht zijn gelaatstrekken zien we in de gekruisigde mens jezus
388123 ik vind dat je de zaken best op scherp mag zetten
388124 god gaat met ons een spanningsvolle geschiedenis aan dat heeft gevolgen voor je leven op allerlei fronten begrijp me goed in de kerk moeten we niet vervallen in moralisme maar de ontmoeting met god strijkt ons ook tegen de haren in waarover het dan gaat ik preekte laatst over de efezebrief daarin gaat het over de oude mens die met christus moet sterven en de nieuwe mens die met hem mag opstaan geloven is dus ook willen sterven omdat je weet dat je alleen zo deel kunt hebben aan het nieuwe leven in christus en dan maakt paulus het ook heel concreet het gaat bijvoorbeeld over boosheid je kunt zeggen je m g boos zijn dat hoort erbij maar paulus zet daar een streep door boosheid is een kracht die aanspraak op jou maakt en je in beslag neemt dat is niet neutraal luther zei je bent een paard dat altijd bereden wordt het is alleen de vraag door wie welke invloed overheerst in je bestaan in onze cultuur lijken genotzucht en erotiek de hoogste deugden te zijn de bijbel is over zulke krachten heel kritisch omdat ze de teugels van je leven in handen nemen god strijdt met zulke machten en wij worden opgeroepen dat ook te doen
388125 het is aantrekkelijk om juist hem te kiezen omdat hij een omvattende geloofsleer heeft geschreven
388126 hoe je je de onafhankelijkheid van god moet voorstellen volgens de gereformeerde orthodoxie kun je dus prima te weten komen in het werk van turrettini
388127 ik vond het belangrijk om een theoloog van voor en een van na de achttiende eeuwse verlichting te kiezen oudere en nieuwere theologische denkbeelden met elkaar in gesprek brengen vind ik een belangrijke taak van de theologie
388128 want die vraag heeft zijn vertrekpunt in het geloof zoals we dat belijden het punt waar het mij om gaat is dit in de gereformeerde orthodoxie is god nadrukkelijk als onafhankelijk beschouwd men sprak over god zoals hij in zijn wezen is dat zou zelfs los van de persoon van jezus kunnen worden gedefinieerd tussen die volstrekt onafhankelijke god en de wereld werd altijd een onderscheid gemaakt god stond als onveranderlijke boven onze werkelijkheid
388129 in turrettinis visie kan dat niet j ngel wijst diens godsbeeld dan ook af hij zegt dat gods relatie van liefde met deze wereld ook voor god zelf iets betekent ook voor zijn diepste wezen hij blijft er niet kil onder maar is helemaal betrokken op de mens en op de wereld de geschiedenis van jezus leven en sterven is ook de geschiedenis van god dat betekent niet dat god en wereld samenvallen maar god is niet denkbaar zonder zijn liefdevolle betrokkenheid bij de mens
388130 monisme wil zeggen alles komt uit n bron god is het begin van alles en alles bestaat ook in hem bij turrettini brengt god die eenheid tot stand door de scheppingsdaad door zijn almacht bij j ngel brengt god haar tot stand in de verzoening door zijn liefde
388131 omdat dat niet spoort met het gewone leven in wat je dagelijks meemaakt ervaar je vaak allerlei spanningen tussen god en diens liefde aan de ene kant en wat tegen hem ingaat aan de andere kant dan kun je denken aan het lijden aan het kwaad als dat allemaal iets is van god of uiteindelijk behoort tot gods handelen verlies je de spanning dan kun je er eigenlijk ook geen moeite meer mee hebben dat vind ik een minpunt van deze zienswijze
388132 een voorbeeld daarvan is de ketterse opvatting dat twee principes de werkelijkheid zouden bepalen de goede god van de bijbel en een kwade god dit beschouw ik zeker niet als een goede verklaring voor de moeite van het bestaan of voor het kwaad maar ik denk wel dat je een zwak dualisme moet erkennen god heeft nog een strijd te strijden om de nieuwe wereld tot stand te brengen als je dat gelooft dan helpt dat om de krachten van het kwaad echt als kwaad te kunnen ervaren en er dan als navolger van god zelf ook tegen te strijden bij j ngel gaat het kwade naar mijn idee te veel op in de omvattende liefde van god maar is het kwade dan nog wel kwaad en is gods toorn over de zonde nog wel echte toorn
388133 die kloof tussen de bijbelse notie van gods toorn en de moderne cultuur is groot toch weten wij als postmoderne mensen heel goed wat kwaad is hoe diep het in onszelf en in onze wereld zit we zijn niet meer zo optimistisch te denken dat wij het kwaad de wereld uit kunnen helpen de ideologie n die daar allemaal op een of andere manier van uitgingen zoals het socialisme het communisme het humanisme en het liberalisme hebben wat dat betreft hun tijd wel gehad mensen hebben sinds auschwitz en 11 september wel begrepen dat het zo gemakkelijk niet gaat de britse schrijver g k chesterton zei dat het dogma van de erfzonde eigenlijk het makkelijkst te bewijzen inzicht van het christelijke geloof is daar heeft hij gelijk in we hebben het door de diepte van de twintigste eeuw weer moeten leren we worden geen betere mensen en als we dat wel denken gaat het pas fout dan verdringen we voor een tijdje de vernietigende krachten die in ons zelf en de schepping huizen van freud kun je leren dat dit psychologisch al heel onverstandig is van de dodenakkers uit de geschiedenis kun je leren dat het ook cultureel gezien negatieve effecten heeft
388134 dan komt de vraag op als wij het kwaad er niet uit krijgen wie dan wel het christelijk geloof vind ik heel realistisch als het zegt het kwaad zit zo diep dat krijg je er zelf niet uit maar als god niet m r dan alleen liefde is dan krijgt hij het er ook niet uit god kan het kwaad er alleen uit krijgen door zich ontzettend kwaad te maken hij krijgt het er alleen uit door onze hele wereld in de nacht te laten ondergaan het lijden van jezus aan het kruis gaat gepaard met een drie uur durende duisternis over het gehele land god laat de schepping ondergaan in de nacht dat is zijn oordeel alleen door de dood heen is er voor ons een nieuw begin mogelijk
388135 dat kan juist vandaag misschien weer duidelijk gemaakt worden omdat wij ons vooruitgangsoptimisme wel goeddeels hebben afgelegd de immense stroom aan boeken en boekjes over hoe je gelukkig wordt en hoe je jezelf blijft laten in feite hetzelfde zien ze zijn er juist een teken van dat het ons niet lukt ook persoonlijk kun je dat zo ervaren wanneer help je een ander het beste lang niet altijd door te bevestigen jij mag er zijn het is goed dat je er bent vaak ben je juist meer geholpen met kritiek god houdt ons in christus een spiegel voor waarin je jezelf zo scherp ziet dat je het liefst door de grond wilt zakken wilt sterven het evangelie zegt dan dat moet ook maar je sterven is sterven met christus deelhebben aan hem dan kun je weer opstaan dat is uiteindelijk ook voor hedendaagse mensen een veel bevrijdener boodschap dan de boodschap van een god die uitsluitend liefde is
388136 de hoofdlijn van de christelijke traditie in ieder geval tot aan de verlichting
388137 de idee van onafhankelijkheid als absoluutheid om deze reden onhoudbaar is
388138 er geen jezus zonder god is maar wel een god zonder jezus
388139 aan het definitieve van gods openbaring in de gekruisigde christus onvoldoende recht
388140 de theologie moet beginnen bij gods identificatie met de gekruisigde christus

388150 we have to send a strong message to drug traffickers
388151 today i am satisfied that the acquisition of these four vessels will dramatically improve the ability of the royal bahamas defence force to adequately and responsibly carry out its mandate and in so doing further the security interests of our two countries
388152 the vessels will assist the patrol surveillance and interdiction capabilities of the defense force in the areas of drug trafficking illegal migration and human smuggling illegal firearms trafficking the protection of fisheries resources and maritime search and rescue
388153 today the 2008 crawfish season opens and these vessels will be part of defence force armada deployed throughout the great bahama bank with crawfish fishermen and to enforce maritime law

388158 access to capital and credit is essential to growth if that access is restrained or blocked the economic system takes a hit

388181 we swam and hunted and fished thats all we did we didnt know anything about gangs or vandalism
388182 and somewhere along the way we managed to screw it all up and we became disconnected from our natural resources
388183 every minute i was inside playing i spent looking outside i never went back to school but my heart and love was always the outdoors now ive come full circle

388228 look closely and discover the fine details of these life like models each crease and fold is there and the caucasian flesh tone is realistic this hand is a soft rubber like casting of an actual human specimen encasing sturdy wires that allow you to bend the fingers into many plausible positions and a few impossible ones
388229 these anatomically proportional one sixth scale models have over 30 points of articulation allowing them to display virtually the full range of human movement they are constructed of highly durable plastic a display stand is included both male and female heads have generic facial features and the hands are crafted with distinctive expressive fingers to make detailed drawing easier

388244 working with kids you have the opportunity to build character
388245 the fourth of july was like a perfect storm for the teams
388246 it wasnt just shutting down the fireworks but also school budget cuts so these coaches are struggling
388247 we want to teach kids discipline hard work teamwork self esteem and get them involved in activities
388248 kids dont get to be kids anymore so we let them have fun
388249 playing sports gives them a break from sitting at home in front of the tv and gives them a chance to be active
388250 its a great idea sports help encourage perseverance in kids we want them to know that you should try your best
388251 sports camp is cool the first time i went to camp i didnt know it would be this fun but i made a best friend here
388252 the cool thing about sports camp and all the camps is that we show kids theyre really valued
388253 the goal is to make a difference one child at a time
388254 you need to remember the strike but not repeat it

388259 i enjoy the fact that i get to worship god through the kind of music i listen to
388260 ramtha one day told me that to understand myself i would have to see myself from a different dimension
388261 and i would have to understand the conscious and reality of that dimension so he told me i was going to leave my body
388262 his message is behold god lives inside of you and that you are remarkable but you dont know that you are remarkable because no ones told you that and your nature here is to create reality
388263 anybody can put themselves into a relaxed state theres nothing unusual about that
388264 but it uses a very eastern and bizarre interpretation of it pretending its the scientific proof it is a simplistic distortion of quantum mechanics and in fact many scientists were outraged because they were quoted out of context and felt that they werent really being treated honestly
388265 i wouldnt give up doing the work with ramtha because people dont believe in me

388268 they have a lot of stepping stones in place to keep coming up the ladder and be a big 12 contender they keep getting a little better each year it wasnt an easy decision
388269 id been talking to the coaching staff at iowa quite a bit and i had developed some pretty good relationships with the coaches over the past few years
388270 one of the most important things is its good to get it over with before my senior season starts so i can be the best i can be for my high school team first and then start working in with the hawkeyes its a lot of weight off your shoulders you dont have to be thinking about recruiting or anything like that you can just relax and play football
388271 i wanted to go out there and help the team contribute and perform but injuries have slowed me down my opportunity is here now and its time for me to show up
388272 but i think he has a lot of potential and i think that hes working real hard personally i think that he is going to pan out
388273 ive spoke to a couple of guys whove had problems in their early years when they first got into the nfl
388274 everything takes time some guys it doesnt some guys it does ill keep the same positive attitude ive had since i got here and ill continue to work hard because hard work pays off
388275 weve got a lot of guys like myself who like to complain
388276 but when he told us about soliders in the 120 degree heat wearing 100 pounds of gear id rather be playing football
388277 ive dreamt of this happening ever since i was a little kid this is all ive ever thought about
388278 he was born to do this i know it sounds stupid but its true
388279 i felt like a little kid in there you cant help but picture yourself there but ive got to work hard it could be a ways away or never happen
388280 but on the car ride home from san francisco he said dad im 100 percent after going in the clubhouse
388281 obviously the coffeehouse is part of the church but people wont be preached to there
388282 i feel like if most people come in theyll realize we dont have a hidden agenda
388283 we just wanted to make this a really warm friendly place
388284 and its so close to campus so hopefully people come in to hang out
388285 i think its going to be a good place for people to connect with the community
388286 are they stupid enough not to see that i am a chemist not a biologist

388288 you cant have an animal producing antibodies without having it in a terribly deteriorating condition
388289 ive not held a mouse in my hand my whole life
388290 i would be glad if they want to inquire about it directly rather than printing a threatening message and scaring my family
388291 dont they realize that it is just a kind of terrorism

388308 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
388309 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
388310 felt a false sense of security in the united states
388311 because historically there has been less anti semitism than in other countries but there have been incidents neo nazi terrorist attacks arab terrorist attacks jews have to be vigilant
388312 the threat is not from the american people or government
388313 terrorist sleeper cells that want to target jews these people are very dangerous and the fbi issues warnings against them very often
388314 the average american is friendly to jews but were worried about those individuals on the periphery of society
388315 we realized there is a need for this kind of organization and as israeli combat veterans living in the us we have the skills and ability to respond to this
388316 we believe all jews in the us must be legally armed and trained
388317 and towards this goal we hold paramilitary training camps to train and equip jewish american youth
388318 are 100 legal and in compliance with all federal state and local laws

388323 as we need to be constantly ready to respond to any incident
388324 know your rights and learn how every american can and must be legally armed and how to express the second amendment
388325 we wouldnt have a problem with non jews coming either

388328 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
388329 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination
388330 the territory government will provide 5 million to support the establishment of the hub and 3 million to support marketing of routes and destinations
388331 the aim of the agreement is to grow the international market and the darwin hub

388336 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these las vegas chefs workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
388337 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
388338 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing las vegas chefs workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
388339 seven ways to increase productivity in the las vegas chefs business

388342 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
388343 our las vegas chefs company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
388344 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
388345 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
388346 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the las vegas chefs industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously

388389 here is now however some light at the end of the tunnel and a serious prospect of attracting new investment and putting these difficulties and the abc loan permanently behind us many of us are working hard to secure this investment over the next few weeks if it comes off we will be able to consign the discussions and post mortems about abc and all the rest to the musings of football historians and concentrate on what should be a very bright future i am sure fans will understand if the board concentrates on securing the new investment over the next period rather than responding to every piece of speculation in the media as soon as it is possible to make an official announcement one will be made

388502 i expected mccain to be squeaking up behind obama in mid october at the best not before august 1
388503 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
388504 we cant go backward but we can use technology more wisely than we are
388505 were really developing a culture of lost threads by thinking that we can always be bouncing around from one thing to another and actually make progress on the things that are important
388506 once you get organized you can think better and you can look at the process of how you do the work
388507 this is all about making it as easy as possible to save for a childs future
388508 if you plan to give a lot you should open your own account
388509 if you plan to give 25 its not worth it
388510 they want to give gifts for a certain purpose as opposed to leaving it to chance
388511 parents should start saving for college nine months before their child is born
388512 in this business size doesnt matter a million dollars could fit in your palm
388513 i love the exploration of it the beauty of it and the business of it
388514 balancing a normal family life and finding enough time in the day to run the business
388515 its easy to have opinions its harder as the boss to make decisions that can be hurtful to you in the future
388516 rents are so high now if we had foreseen this real estate bubble that weve been through the smartest move would have been to buy space instead of lease
388517 am i so passionate about my business theres no way it can fail
388518 you are not alone never underestimate the power of networking
388519 compare the cruise lines and the individual ships to see what activities are offered on board
388520 some cruise lines cater more to families honeymooners or seniors while others are more appropriate for young couples or singles
388521 after spending a few months doing research my boyfriend and i booked our cruise to alaska
388522 the alaska cruise experience was totally different from anything i had ever done
388523 before i thought my husband can take care of himself said oneill 37 who works at an investment firm and lives in midtown
388524 once you have a kid things becomes a little more complex
388525 theres nothing complicated about it especially if you like doing things on your own and on your own time its great
388526 serve people who know what they want and have straightforward wishes
388527 its really important to have the proper advice for your trust or will
388528 when really it is affordable and the amount a person can save after their death goes beyond what they would pay for estate planning services
388529 we would like to see the greatest degree of openness
388530 there has been no change in the iocs position the ioc would like to see open access
388531 when there were problems on wednesday the iocs team met with the organising committee and asked if they could be resolved
388532 we can only encourage moving towards that openness and transparency
388533 the grass is not always greener on the other side taray
388534 that wasnt her that farted her farts dont sound like that
388535 this is not my boo what in the world am i doing here
388536 the grass is not always greener on the other side
388537 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
388538 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
388539 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
388540 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
388541 tanpa panjang lebar lagi saya akan berbicara mengenai sebuah hubungan dimana hari ke hari ini banyak orang yang bercerita ke saya mengenai pasangan mereka dimana mereka mendambakan pasangan mereka agar menjadi seperti orang yang mereka idolakan
388542 namun manusia tak mampu menjagaku maka lebih baik aku mematikan diriku saja
388543 manusia tak mau mengenalku untuk itulah tak ada gunanya aku tetap menyala
388544 mereka saling membenci bahkan membenci mereka yang mencintainya membenci keluarganya
388545 ekh apa yang terjadi kalian harus tetap menyala aku takut akan kegelapan
388546 banyak perempuan telah berbuat baik tetapi kau melebihi mereka semua
388547 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
388548 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
388549 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state
388550 why does drinking beer leads to more problems accident and crime
388551 according to vietnamese law glitter will be freed on august 19
388552 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison
388553 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
388554 when i was on holiday i never went on to the internet i never read the newspapers so to be honest i was with my family so my phone was off so i didnt know what was happening
388555 when i came back i realised what was happening but you know the thing has happened already so now the most important thing is behind me and i will show everyone this club has given me a lot of things
388556 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
388557 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league
388558 it is true we are young but we know that if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something
388559 he had some good games against the usa and was real brash about it trash talked things of that nature
388560 this is what i do they the u s coaches reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
388561 we really do not want to create a scandal supporting one thing and then receiving evidence to the contrary
388562 its not often we put up eight runs and lose not with our pitching
388563 its pretty tough to pitch when you cant spot your fastball its been like that since ive come back i dont know why
388564 i told each and every one of them i believe we can win with you
388565 all of our coaches feel that way it is one of the strengths of our team
388566 its obvious that they were competing and working hard in the summer
388567 i went and watched all of those games when they happened and through the off season and tavita did improve very much over the course of the season
388568 unfortunately we didnt win as many games as we wanted and thats everybody thats why i said we need to be a stronger team we need to be a better coached team we need to coach the fundamentals and the techniques better but tavita pritchard improved
388569 im not in such a hurry to make a decision just because i feel like we have three guys who can win games
388570 its one thing to say that we have two guys or three guys that were not sure are good enough thats one you want to get resolved because that guy needs the most amount of reps to get better we feel good about all three guys
388571 alex is a big strong athletic son of a gun
388572 he throws a great deep ball he can run with our wideouts
388573 i guess maybe people have that perception that stanford is an elite place
388574 were all very fortunate to be either working here at stanford or going to school here very privileged but we dont want to forget where we come from either
388575 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
388576 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be a dodger
388577 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
388578 we got 20 or 25 first downs i thought that was a good effort
388579 i thought we were right on the precipice of scoring last night
388580 for us to win this game were going to rely heavily on them
388581 a loss would almost eliminate us at this point just in terms of morale
388582 i dont think we could afford to go down another six points to this team
388583 but at this point our club needs to get a win wherever possible whether its in oakland santa clara or san francisco
388584 im very pleased to still be with the guys to be in a place ive been my whole career
388585 theres some comfort in not having to prepare for a change ive said all along i prefer not to get traded
388586 the truth is the easiest part was during the game
388587 it was the down time around 2 30 in the afternoon before the game
388588 they said were not going to trade you for what were getting offered
388589 i would say it was a fiasco and i would say it was as clueless of a staff as ive ever heard it was a complete joke
388590 to be a quarterback who has never played in that situation certainly was difficult
388591 ive said many times to come out the other end of that and still survive i cant name another guy in the nfl who has been through that type of situation at the quarterback position i cant name one
388592 so thats disconcerting when youre in a situation when its open competition and it doesnt matter you take everything with a grain of salt
388593 i was ecstatic about coming back here i look at myself as a giant but im in the odd man out category would it hurt me to not play down the stretch i dont know
388594 i heard the same thing when i played in cincinnati that nobody wanted me
388595 later on i heard that teams had claimed me and they took me off waivers its a tough time of year thats why i want to talk to sabean i want to see what these next couple months hold for me
388596 hell still get in there two or three times a week
388597 it might but i think i have a reputation that goes past my numbers
388598 i feel good and i want to give it a shot my hitting has improved and i can still pick it i dont think i really need to show anything
388599 selfishly we want a better record than we had last year
388600 thats something everybody should be striving for at least on a won loss basis it would show improvement
388601 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
388602 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
388603 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
388604 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
388605 id say today was like thursday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there
388606 if theres any doubt and guys arent sure i think they should be playing
388607 you can be retired for the rest of your life youll know when youre done
388608 if youre not 100 per cent certain that you dont want to play anymore then the decision is that you should be playing
388609 people always told me play as long as you can
388610 its been the hardest battle ive ever fought coming back from those injuries but being here at the olympics again with my teammates im over the moon
388611 thats the kind of thing you learn not to do when youre a kid
388612 i felt like throwing up but my body went into protection mode it actually hurt a lot more afterwards
388613 i believe that things happen for a reason in this case my teammates were able to prove themselves because they finished 11th and did qualify as a team without me for myself i was able to prove that i could come back from a very traumatic injury it does build strength of character
388614 i feel healed but i can also still feel that stuff in there
388615 here i was 26 years old and completely dependent on other people i couldnt shower i couldnt prepare my own meals that really opened my eyes it was a lesson in asking others for help which id never really done in my life
388616 there was definitely a few times when i thought this is crazy youll never be capable of getting back to that level but im a pretty stubborn person also i really didnt want to end my career on those terms he broke his legs and was done
388617 but im not convinced the chinese will win as many medals as everyone is saying
388618 its been a bit of a struggle but thankfully weve been able to get it through here theyre basically going to allow us to do it and the reds were very co operative at the 11th hour
388619 i was excited when i went to the sydney and athens games i cant say that this time
388620 i dont know what i should think about a country where people cant speak freely
388621 i could be the best turd polisher in the world but at the end of the day im still working with shit
388622 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
388623 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
388624 to make my opponents all tired and then just beat them
388625 it will take time for me to make that better because at the moment im struggling to play at a high level for two sets
388626 if i was playing three sets i dont know they would probably have to take me out in an ambulance
388627 our tickets say row two so why are we sitting in row four
388628 now you come to us saying sorry screw you loyal fan and paying customer
388629 this is about trying to maximize every inch of the building for sure
388630 its a different section and it doesnt affect his sight line so hes kind of putting apples and oranges together
388631 i cant look section 126 in the eye and say you have first dibs
388632 we gave up one big play but holding that offence to 11 points with milt stegall in it is very good
388633 he was straight saying were not playing up to par we basically lost the game last week he expects more out of us and we had to step up
388634 when youre the no 1 team in the league defensively year in and year out youve got six months to watch what we do
388635 we started off a step behind everybody this year and now were starting to move and were even with everybody now weve got to find a way to get a step ahead
388636 weve figured out what people are going to try to do to us
388637 we didnt score in the second half weve scored four points in the last two halves and we havent scored a touchdown since two games ago
388638 usually on offence last year wed get eight first downs so it has nothing to do with how we played last year
388639 i felt at halftime it should have been about 30 3
388640 were going to make sure that our engineers are working closely with the engineers from the companies that had asked
388641 we would welcome testing that we have been asking for all along
388642 were hoping it doesnt affect the hospitals ability to deliver services
388643 weve been struggling with this decision for a couple weeks or so and felt we needed to do this to make the hospital financially sustainable
388644 we are spending more and more dollars on uninsured patients
388645 were seeing patients putting off a lot of their elective procedures and testing procedures like outpatient surgeries
388646 i think it is a viable solution and is very typical in health care to use temporary staff based on the change in volume
388647 it is something that is a typical course of action in hospitals to have that kind of flexibility
388648 we just havent been getting after it like we need to be
388649 we just havent been in the mindset that we need to be in to win games were a battle tested team well bounce back from this and make the right adjustments for the next game
388650 i heard some sounds and i went to the bedroom door
388651 i went into the hall and there were two people with flashlights
388652 its hard this late in the season when one thing goes bad it snowballs more than earlier in the season when everybody is fresh mental fatigue is just as bad as physical fatigue
388653 i threw a lot of fastballs and theyre a good fastball hitting team
388654 when you try too hard sometimes you have a few games like were having
388655 i have done this for 10 years for the families so they know they are not alone to support each other and remind law enforcement that we have not forgotten
388656 and it is to remind individuals who have taken loved ones lives that we have not forgotten
388657 it all comes down to what people want to say
388658 i see that person on the street and it is devastating to walk by and not be able to say something
388659 it makes a difference when i know they are walking around free and my son is in a grave that drives me
388660 we want people to keep hope alive and just not give up
388661 there are people out there who have no trouble taking lives and people dont want to put their families in harms way
388662 i realized that if i wanted to keep doing this i had to take it more seriously i have to be a professional and work harder
388663 it is important for me to have a big year i know that
388664 i figure if they can be 310 why not be 295
388665 our defensive package is about movement quickness and finesse they dont need the extra size
388666 when you get a sack it just about ends that offensive series and thats key
388667 we have to get that production from our front four thats big
388668 i bet we knew where she was because the ruskies told us
388669 scorpion down we dont know why she sunk but we do know the pentagon lied about when they knew
388670 why am i wasting my time on this when i have this product running in my house that is supposed to save time
388671 dried seaweeds from here are exported all the way to bulacan this technology shall enable our ric members to have more income from seaweeds instead of just selling it in fresh or dried form
388672 soon to be out are seaweed pan de sal seaweed lychee and seaweed maja blanca
388673 i have been having a hard time supporting my family with a small wage now i am one of those losing their jobs
388674 i have been working with mega fishing since i was 20 years old my husband is unemployed and just tends farms nearby where will i get the money to feed my children
388675 its not just the workers who are affected but all the canning companies in zamboanga city where will i get another job
388676 i really pity those who lost their jobs we are also at the losing end
388677 but because of the high cost of raw materials like sardines tamban they also stopped their operation so my workers dont have anything to work on anymore
388678 the high cost of fuel affected the canning industry bunker fuel which cost p22 a liter before is now p55 per liter
388679 we do understand and sympathize with the affected workers but we cannot sacrifice more and end up with nothing
388680 the city produces 80 percent of canned sardines in the country and is known as the sardines capital of the philippines the industry will die if nothing is done about it
388681 the fishing and cannery industry the local and national government must sit together and discuss these problems
388682 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
388683 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
388684 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
388685 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
388686 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
388687 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
388688 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
388689 now they are frustrated and are making every attempt to communalise the situation
388690 the kashmiris have never targeted non muslims in fact we provided food and lodging facilities to the yatris and tourists during the agitation against the land transfer
388691 this is high time to make ourselves self reliant this is a must so that nobody threatens kashmiris to block supply routes
388692 we were coming towards jammu when around fifty hindu extremists came out from behind the bushes and showered bricks and stones on our vehicles near jagerkotli and damaged most of the vehicles
388693 that is new hardware or software that makes it possible to automate a system or process

388776 the thing is o a r has never been just one style from song to song we like to switch it up

388807 his mark was brilliant looks like he might get himself a car too
388808 it was a fantastic grab but eight goals one was absolutely sensational he plays close to goals he plays higher he has a lot of variety in his game and his leadership is fantastic
388809 they play an interesting game style where they get a lot of numbers back which makes it a little bit hard for our forwards but to kick nineteen goals and nine points was a good conversion rate and it was a gutsy win i thought
388810 i think our boys got a little over anxious at times and probably defensively gave up some pretty soft goals with the melbourne players getting up over our defence
388811 they have some dangerous players melbourne and they were very good around the stoppages which is an area we were beaten in pretty soundly we have been pretty strong around the midfield clearance in recent weeks but they gave us a bit of a toweling up in the area today

388816 clearly this guy knew he was wanted and we had the place surrounded and he was refusing to come out
388817 when we made entry he still had a gun right next to him it could have turned into a potentially deadly encounter
388818 that sounds like something hed say but what else did he say
388819 he said i should leave for a little bit after telling teque just until he calms down
388820 can you hold on i gotta piss like it aint nothin
388821 he kicked him and knocked him to the ground punching him numerous times
388822 wow i cant believe it he seemed like such a nice guy a real hard worker
388823 he didnt necessarily have anything to do with the use of the cards
388824 thats shocking that he was an employee i guess they dont screen their employees good enough

388826 damn momma you demonstrating to your husband that its alright that he touched me
388827 one of the most amazing online gaming economy related sales we had was in last septembers auction
388828 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the online gaming economy domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
388829 privacy is absolutely key in the online gaming economy business
388830 once top domains are registered their security protection and legacy becomes mission critical
388831 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making online gaming economy related buying decisions
388832 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
388833 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for online gaming economy companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
388834 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the online gaming economy internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain
388835 but when you think about it you want a domain that people can remember and a domain that is free of any blacklist status so that you can use it to freely communicate with online gaming economy customers
388836 this is good news for all those in the online gaming economy marketing business
388837 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
388838 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
388839 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar

388897 web 2 0 and social computing era appears destined for mainstream status a new study concludes
388898 right now we have one great big pile of stuff on the web and especially in the blogosphere
388899 with tagging both by the content author and the public i think therell be a good opportunity to start moving content into more specific relevant piles that would help make sorting through the blogosphere a lot easier and a lot more useful for a lot of people
388900 to some extent tagging is user friendly but a lot of people dont understand it
388901 the act of tagging is likely to be embraced by a more mainstream population in the future because many organizations are making it easier and easier to tag internet content
388902 tagging is a kind of next stage search phenomenon a way to mark store and then retrieve the web content that users already found valuable and of which they want to keep track

388906 later werd ik stoker en olieman ik ben als bemanningslid vier keer de wereld rondgereisd

388919 i always take my students to porteau cove when i talk about landslides on the sea to sky because its such a classic example of a geological situation where you can get landslides
388920 its an area where the geology is particularly bad with respect to having a road below it
388921 youre never going to completely eliminate the risk of landslides
388922 what they cant really control is these larger deeper failures because there arent bolts long enough to secure the rock that deep
388923 i imagine a tunnel would be expensive but again you kind of have to look at this in a longer term public safety context
388924 if there had been loss of life there this discussion would have been very different
388925 if you look at the european alps or japan or hong kong places where they have a very high population density and theyre mountainous this is something that for them is just routine
388926 they deal with the problem they clear the roads they open it up and they hope that they can limit the fatalities
388927 the rock systems were poised to give trouble this was a classic setup for a landslide
388928 it must be presumed that the person has completely recovered his or her moral integrity
388929 the staff and the team here will remain in place
388930 that was one of the important things in the negotiations the team will continue to run the company independently
388931 our goal is to help abe continue to grow over time
388932 abebooks brings added breadth and expanded selection to our customers worldwide
388933 abebooks has built a great business and weve watched them from seattle for a while and we think we can build a great selling and buying customer experience together
388934 we think there are a lot of things that abebooks has been able to work on and develop over time that we can learn from and we hope there are things that weve developed at amazon that we can share whether its technology or know how or experience in certain markets
388935 allow abebooks to expand its offerings and introduce new features and services to enhance the book buying and selling experience

388938 my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
388939 where silent diplomacy on human rights fails strong public pressure can clearly have an effect
388940 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfill the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
388941 remains concerned that access is inconsistent and many internet sites remain off limits
388942 falls short of the promise made by the host and the international olympic committee of complete freedom for the media
388943 it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which websites are censored and which are accessible
388944 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
388945 it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
388946 hes definitely not the evil person people are making him out to be
388947 i think that judge youngs decision was very well thought out very thorough and i think in the end it was the right decision
388948 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
388949 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
388950 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
388951 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
388952 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
388953 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
388954 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
388955 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
388956 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
388957 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
388958 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
388959 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
388960 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
388961 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
388962 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
388963 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
388964 dej todo en 1 de bup por una peque a depresi n lo dej desde los 14 hasta los 19 en el colegio siempre llev todo sobresaliente hasta 8 cuando mi nota baj a notable luego en el instituto no estaba bien y lo dej a mi me influyeron mucho los compa eros me daban mucha ca a porque yo soy t mida y bajita y bueno a esa edad siempre empiezan a meterse con tu f sico est s en una edad del pavo una edad de cambio vives en tu mundo y para ti una cosa que no tiene importancia ahora entonces era como si me tiraran una bomba hay mucha gente que se met an conmigo y que no le importaba y luego empiezas a apartarte y bueno a los 19 a os me met en lo de adultos y muy bien casi he terminado con los de mi edad estoy muy contenta

388967 i dont really think about no 1 if it happens it happens but at the moment i dont deserve that spot
388968 she returns a lot of balls she runs very well its tough to take a point against her you have to earn it and work hard for everything
388969 i was quite nervous and i made a lot of mistakes
388970 i dont feel fresh after long rallies but i saw that she was tired too i dont think she knew what to do because i was not making mistakes i was winning long rallies
388971 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
388972 the legislatures decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaska and lower 48 customers
388973 the ratification of our licence under agia alaska gasline inducement act will facilitate transcanadas continuing commercial negotiations with potential shippers improving the likelihood of a successful open season and the construction of a natural gas delivery system from prudhoe bay to lower 48 markets
388974 her message to alaskans and really to north americans generally is this is a good day for alaskans but just one step along the way for developing a successful project
388975 de entre todos los pa ses donde la tasa de obtenci n de un diploma de estudios universitarios ha aumentado al menos cinco puntos entre las generaciones de 25 a 44 a os espa a es el nico en el que la r pida progresi n del n mero de titulados se ha acompa ado de una disminuci n sensible de las ventajas salariales asociadas a un mayor nivel de formaci n
388976 las razones por las que el mercado de trabajo espa ol no ha reaccionado igual que los otros son diversas
388977 puede que haya influido la proliferaci n de los llamados contratos basura tambi n el que no haya una buena relaci n pasarelas claras entre la universidad y el mundo laboral
388978 corea irlanda y espa a han conocido una explosi n del n mero de estudiantes
388979 si bien es cierto que la ense anza no es de gran calidad tampoco deja mucha gente por el camino espa a es el pa s m s igualitario del mundo los resultados entre j venes de extracci n humilde o inmigrantes no son sustancialmente distintos de los que obtienen los hijos de las clases altas es m s espa a es de los 10 pa ses analizados el que mayor n mero de hijos de trabajadores consigue enviar a la universidad
388980 a los americanos no les importa que el nivel de su secundaria sea bajo porque lo f an todo a la universidad que forma las elites de medio mundo
388981 invierten mucho en educaci n pero lo hacen para lograr una ense anza a la carta con pocos alumnos por clase y sobre todo con atenci n personalizada ayudan a salvar a los que en otros pa ses se hunden y ayudan tambi n a surgir la excelencia
388982 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
388983 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
388984 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
388985 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
388986 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
388987 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
388988 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
388989 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
388990 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
388991 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
388992 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
388993 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
388994 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
388995 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
388996 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
388997 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
388998 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
388999 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
389000 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
389001 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
389002 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
389003 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
389004 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
389005 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
389006 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
389007 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
389008 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
389009 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
389010 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
389011 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
389012 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
389013 if theres one word that sums up the churchs attitude to sex it would be wow
389014 it already has to some extent i go to a church where i can practise the sort of catholicism i believe was intended by vatican ii
389015 it welcomes gays and many of us would see a case for abortion for instance if it involved a young girl who had been raped i see no problem in that
389016 catholicism has always been a moveable feast things come and go and nobody minds were used to change years ago mary sometimes seemed more adored than jesus but these days you hardly hear of her possibly the women priest issue had something to do with that
389017 we raised our kids catholic but they went their own way they dont go to church but do think themselves catholic
389018 gen ys from conservative protestant denominations manifest much higher levels of religious belief and practise than catholics or anglicans
389019 at one meeting some 2000 of them stepped forward after he had pitched them a line of rock n rollery
389020 in america teenagers have a language all their own and think that grown ups are all squares because they cant dig the jive
389021 what happens to those young catholics when they go back to their churches will anything have changed
389022 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
389023 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
389024 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
389025 the amounts were very very very small and were not of the sort that would affect the human body or the environment
389026 the claim that the u s navys nuclear powered vessels are safe and are not susceptible to radiation leaks has completely broken down
389027 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
389028 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
389029 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
389030 hold me like a mother would like i always knew somebody should
389031 this is life and everythings all right livin livin livin livin livin
389032 love will wash your brain hug you like a ghost it really is the most
389033 was signed by the artist terrance osborne but not by its subject philip frazier a founding member of the rebirth brass band it ran me along with tax shipping and handling over 250 which was still cheaper than a trip to new orleans and entry to the actual fest and thereby a bargain

389035 turn left at the kermit the frog then go right at the gumby
389036 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
389037 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
389038 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
389039 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
389040 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
389041 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
389042 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
389043 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
389044 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
389045 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
389046 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
389047 ive never had a problem donating to others but never liked having to be helped myself
389048 but given the situation were in i am fine with it
389049 its not what you would consider a high profile show but its a fun show and a fun family event
389050 youll have kids coming up to you after who are learning to play guitar and if you can touch one of them and say you can make this happen its worth it
389051 we knew each other growing up and had jammed together in our parents basement
389052 in the last few years we got together and said lets make this work
389053 these nominations have opened up a lot of doors for us especially last year to get us out of the ottawa toronto and kingston area
389054 our goal is to get some shows out in western canada and i think this will help us with radio air play and help us get recognized out west
389055 a lot of stations have said its a little too edgy so at some points we tried to pull it back a little bit but the producer were working with said we have to be ourselves and make our own music
389056 people in the industry say you have to do it that way but weve been doing it the way it feels right in our heart and its neat to see weve been recognized for it
389057 we still do a lot of shows playing other peoples music but were putting more and more of our original music in
389058 we get to meet all these other bands just like us slugging it out in the bars playing wedding receptions and waiting for their song to hit the radio and make an impact
389059 the show was filmed in toronto and most of the live audience was our fans they called right away and got the tickets and cmt canada said theyd never seen that may people show up for a live recording of a show before
389060 they see us as small town guys just trying to make it
389061 the goal was to be working every weekend and pay for my rent on my apartment and buy enough kraft dinner to get through the month
389062 if production on the 360 version of ffxiii hasnt started
389063 that was the ps3 trailer shown at last years tokyo game show
389064 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
389065 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
389066 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
389067 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
389068 of all the pocket beaches associated with coast dairies laguna beach is among the richest
389069 itll give people a feel of what the area was like prior to human disturbance
389070 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
389071 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

389073 we have now received mr ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital he arrived here by ambulance at 5am today following an air ambulance flight from antigua
389074 the medical and nursing hand over process between the clinical team which accompanied him here and the intensive care team at morriston has now taken place initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details
389075 according to vietnamese law glitter will be freed on august 19
389076 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison

389078 the medical and nursing hand over process between the clinical team which accompanied him here and the intensive care team at morriston has now taken place
389079 initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details
389080 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
389081 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
389082 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
389083 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
389084 the legislatures decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaskan and lower 48 consumers we are pleased to receive this vote of confidence from the representatives of the people of alaska
389085 this ratification of our license under agia will facilitate transcanadas continuing commercial negotiations with potential shippers improving the likelihood of a successful open season and the construction of a natural gas delivery system from prudhoe bay to lower 48 markets

389098 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
389099 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
389100 any information leaked to the public about the opening ceremony will be dealt with severely
389101 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar
389102 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
389103 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
389104 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable casino computer programmer volunteers researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
389105 without the awesome casino computer programmer volunteers studies of wagnor pettinella this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the casino computer programmer volunteers world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
389106 im happy to see that young people are interested in our casino computer programmer volunteers studies
389107 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
389108 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of casino computer programmer volunteers studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
389109 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
389110 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
389111 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
389112 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
389113 the letters are in ancient hebrew and are very clearly preserved
389114 it is amazing we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
389115 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel
389116 rather than forcing the ions to jump from hole to hole the new material has lots of vacant spaces to be occupied so the ions can travel much more quickly
389117 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
389118 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
389119 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan we need to identify these people and weed them out
389120 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
389121 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
389122 this important issue will welcome india into the non proliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
389123 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community

389300 i wanted to follow up taboo with a musical that was focused on something closer to home erics a club that left its mark on me when i was a teenager
389301 this is my story and i know people from the scene such as pete wylie from wah heat julian cope of the teardrop explodes and jayne casey of big in japan who all know that this is a musical based on my experiences in life this is musical drama not a documentary or indeed a docudrama its pure unadulterated theatre
389302 erics was our generations cavern without the merchandise to prove it but this is not a nostalgia play about the club its far more than that its about life and will appeal to people who went there but it goes way beyond that its uplifting and life affirming and will have people talking for a long time after theyve seen it
389303 all of the songs are from the club either at that time or came out of the club over the next couple of years so i spoke to norman early on and he was one of the first to say that if i wrote erics i should find a really good story to hang on to i like to believe that i have

389311 true to life as far as writing from my personal experiences goes
389312 there are so many benefits to beginning freshmen to live on campus and experience campus life that we wanted to set up an endowed fund to help students who might not otherwise be able to afford to live on campus and enjoy this experience
389313 students who live on campus are able to get involved with activities creating life long friendships and they have a better opportunity to develop the core personal values that can guide them for the rest of their lives
389314 we have been greatly impressed with the leadership and stewardship of president debow freed and we are glad we are able to give back to the university that has provided us so many opportunities and been an important part of our life
389315 the kind of support that mr and mrs charnes are providing is very meaningful in many ways
389316 their generosity will allow other students for many many years to come to share the campus experience that shapes so many lives the gift to the endowment helps to further strengthen the long term financial health of the institution and their gift stands as a shining example to all alumni to give generously so that others can benefit also we are all deeply grateful to a r and mary ann for this wonderful gift

389341 we need to bring in three or four main players that are going to cost big money and my standards are that high that im not going to bring them down
389342 we need to bring in better players now to try and help the squad but we dont have bundles of cash
389343 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
389344 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly
389345 indeed any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
389346 david and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign

389438 there was a man from among a nation before you who killed ninety nine people and then made an inquiry about the most learned person on the earth he was directed to a monk he came to him and told him that he had killed ninety nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted he replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred he then asked about the most learned man in the earth he was directed to a scholar he told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted he replied in the affirmative and asked who stands between you and repentance go to such and such land there you will find people devoted to prayer and worship of allah join them in worship and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place so he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment the angels of mercy pleaded this man has come with a repenting heart to allah and the angels of punishment argued he never did a virtuous deed in his life then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them he said measure the distance between the two lands he will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer they measured and found him closer to the land land of piety where he intended to go and so the angels of mercy collected his soul

389444 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector

389529 wir werden uns von rennen zu rennen weiter steigern das ist die voraussetzung um 2008 um den titel zu k mpfen
389530 domestic trade is growing very fast while imports and exports have started to decline
389531 were prepared for the winter weve reserved a lot of cash
389532 they nobel prize winners repeatedly observe that eminent scientists get disproportionately great credit for their contributions to science
389533 while relatively unknown scientists tend to get disproportionately little credit for comparable contributions
389534 it would be bad news for hamburg if van der vaart left the club because hes been three years with us and has contributed greatly to the team
389535 but if the player wants to go to spain we cannot stop him
389536 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
389537 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
389538 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
389539 mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
389540 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
389541 singura cale ca s ne rezolv m problemele n aceast ar e s fim uni i negrii albi hispanici asiatici tineri b tr ni cu handicap fizic homosexuali sau heterosexuali aceasta ar trebui s fie preocuparea noastr
389542 kami ingin kader partai ini dapat mengedepankan hati nuraninya dalam setiap tindakan
389543 tidak ada pemimpin agama yang melarang menggunakan hati nurani dalam menyelesaikan masalah yang dihadapi
389544 tadinya saya datang ke sini niatnya untuk liat yang lucu lucu tapi tadi mau belanja harganya belum ada yang cocok karena tawarannya terlalu mahal
389545 jelas jelas ada sejumlah organisasi kesehatan internasional yang menjadikan kesehatan sebagai alat untuk berdagang atas nama teknologi inilah sulitnya memberantas flu burung
389546 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
389547 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
389548 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
389549 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
389550 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
389551 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
389552 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
389553 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
389554 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
389555 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt
389556 had found another man and he did not want to have any kids around
389557 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
389558 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
389559 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
389560 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
389561 it was sort of an unspoken thing our family didnt talk about it at all
389562 but the circumstances of what we heard that she left without saying goodbye to her own children we knew she would never have done that a mother would never go off without saying goodbye to her own children
389563 we have a lot more guest rooms with hot showers now
389564 theres not one speck of smoke in the valley today
389565 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
389566 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
389567 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
389568 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
389569 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
389570 a lot of people are really worried is my lawyer really a lawyer
389571 there are a lot of people who are in need of information
389572 he kicked him and knocked him to the ground punching him numerous times
389573 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
389574 his nature was more primitive person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
389575 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
389576 ive never had a problem donating to others but never liked having to be helped myself
389577 but given the situation were in i am fine with it
389578 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
389579 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
389580 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
389581 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
389582 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
389583 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
389584 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
389585 today we learned barack obama has once again moved the way of the political winds trading in leadership and credibility for political expedience as he reversed his categorical opposition to offshore oil drilling
389586 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
389587 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
389588 we have been blocked since 2003 the fact that our web site is unblocked is very good news
389589 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
389590 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
389591 this important issue will welcome india into the non proliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
389592 clearly this guy knew he was wanted and we had the place surrounded and he was refusing to come out
389593 when we made entry he still had a gun right next to him it could have turned into a potentially deadly encounter
389594 it was exciting to find some of these ingredients because first of all theyre rare
389595 i didnt know some of these things can be grown here
389596 at the restaurant we highlight ingredients that are behind the culture
389597 everything hurts when im sitting in front of the television
389598 these gardeners are very picky very particular about their produce
389599 you can taste the love that went into what they grew
389600 we are thrilled that at last the 2009 senior games are truly on the horizon and thousands of athletes across the country are qualifying to come here next year
389601 we take our pledge to provide the very best competitive conditions seriously working with stanford university and our other outstanding venues we will deliver on this promise
389602 hotels restaurants and shops will be filled with these athletes and their families
389603 the message is everyone can exercise and live a long and fulfilling life
389604 its going to be wonderful to have seniors from all 50 states coming here to compete but its going to be equally wonderful for the people of the bay area to learn the athletes stories see them compete and be inspired
389605 you see the young athletes on tv like michael phelps and might think i cant do that anymore
389606 well we have the opportunity to show that we can still do the same things
389607 everyone knows you come to the dmv to wait its sort of a foregone conclusion
389608 you get your little number thing and its like youre playing bingo at the dmv
389609 its insane there are people everywhere everywhere its like a concert in there without the music
389610 im trying to listen with one ear it would be horrible if they called my number and i didnt hear it because i was watching denise richards
389611 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan we need to identify these people and weed them out
389612 an a for effort but their proposal is unsatisfactory and needs many improvements
389613 of all the pocket beaches associated with coast dairies laguna beach is among the richest
389614 itll give people a feel of what the area was like prior to human disturbance
389615 frankly in this era of dwindling resources for local government weve got to rely on our neighbors and the community
389616 ive been working on third avenue traffic issues for three years and this is the most empowered ive felt
389617 were going to get this off the ground and were going to make it a success
389618 if somebody flags them down we tell them to let us know dont take any action on your own
389619 theyre limited to driving to and from the destination they will not be patrolling in a police vehicle
389620 its positioned great i wish we had something like this out where i live
389621 were trying to develop a vocabulary of what san jose will become
389622 a lot of companies are looking into ways to make electronic records easily transferable
389623 we are the first to do this but probably not the last
389624 some of the kids have never done anything like this
389625 you lose points if your bird flies off the table
389626 if we dont have it we cant have the market animals
389627 we dont get to do what we love the most
389628 there were two things you did in the summer you went to the beach and you went to the fair
389629 this is their passion and allowing them to express it is so crucial
389630 if theres something thats more family oriented than 4 h i dont know what it is
389631 it brought my daughter and me together i get emotional talking about it
389632 wow i cant believe it he seemed like such a nice guy a real hard worker
389633 he didnt necessarily have anything to do with the use of the cards
389634 thats shocking that he was an employee i guess they dont screen their employees good enough
389635 weve historically had such good rapport between our staff and our customers
389636 social networking sites are just another way that people say things or do things that come back and haunt them
389637 the things that people say online or leave online are pretty permanent
389638 pending sentencing you should be going to alcoholics anonymous you should be in therapy you should be in a program to learn to deal with drinking and driving
389639 she was doing nothing other than having a good old time
389640 i did feel that gave me some indication of how that young man was feeling a short time after a near fatal accident that he thought it was appropriate to joke and mock about the possibility of going to prison
389641 the pictures showed a kid who didnt know what to do two weeks after this accident
389642 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
389643 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
389644 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
389645 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
389646 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
389647 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
389648 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
389649 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
389650 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
389651 while there may be a small adoption fee most cats at shelters are already vaccinated and spayed or neutered
389652 additionally the cost of litter nutritious food and an occasional toy is relatively low and cats are comparatively inexpensive
389653 we are committed to saving lives and educating the public on responsible cat care
389654 our main goal is to find loving homes for animals that need one
389655 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory and he was going to take everybody out there with him
389656 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
389657 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
389658 please stop using the term road boulder you are denigrating people who obey the law
389659 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
389660 it was magic he called me last night i didnt know you were so fast
389661 its like a kind of 18th century pastoral english village
389662 the demographic is changing as new people move in and old people die or leave
389663 there probably is some tension as a result of that the world changes and people change with it
389664 certainly the rise in property values has seen a shift in the community
389665 whereas it used to be more arts and culture oriented now it is more diverse they the arts and culture types would represent the older part of the community and the newer part would be a variety of people from entrepreneurs to lawyers and so on
389666 ive always had the feeling that theres a very civil relationship and people care for each other as neighbours and feel very citizenly toward the park
389667 we do not ignore the people in the park theres probably more or less intimacy between neighbours
389668 we always joked people were born there then their parents died then they lived in their parents house and then they died thats very stereotypical about a lot of people in the park
389669 there might be matters that need to be investigated and i make no promises to you whatsoever the bottom line is that you were supplying not insignificant quantities of heroin and said you had the ability to supply even more if it was required
389670 all my life i was making money playing poker shooting pool playing golf i always hustled
389671 the public gets the wrong impression young kids get into it they get trapped they lose all their money
389672 i was born and raised here i rode bikes to the creek when i was a kid
389673 we swam and hunted and fished thats all we did we didnt know anything about gangs or vandalism
389674 and somewhere along the way we managed to screw it all up and we became disconnected from our natural resources
389675 every minute i was inside playing i spent looking outside i never went back to school but my heart and love was always the outdoors now ive come full circle
389676 you say somebody used to be a gambler and people look at you funny you look for things is this person being straight with me hermans stories have always jibed
389677 this is grueling work you have long hard days you get wet and cold theres poison oak
389678 its hard to attract people and get them to stay hermans enthusiasm has never wavered
389679 herman was on his hands and knees with these children the entire time he had his cousin directing traffic with the parents there were at least 500 people there we ran out of pizza
389680 we kept the name sunshine in the fair because by either name people can relate to it
389681 the managers had supposed that they had made ample accommodations for all the exhibitors but it proved that not half the accommodations were provided that was necessary the defect will be remedied next year
389682 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
389683 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
389684 but if the fbi was really leaning on him what a tremendous load that was on him
389685 the fbi would be remiss not to look at us especially those of us who worked with anthrax
389686 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
389687 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further
389688 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
389689 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
389690 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
389691 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
389692 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
389693 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
389694 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
389695 men who come closer to fulfilling their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
389696 differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small
389697 of course one doesnt have to be married to be happy but if thats something you really want and it is for most people then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness
389698 aspirations attainments and satisfaction life cycle differences between american women and men
389699 that wall in itself is the rock of the church the firmness of the people who went before it
389700 it stands for the super dedicated people who sacrificed and made everything possible that goes on today
389701 our church has a reputation for being a caring church were a church of strong leaders and workers
389702 just the longevity and the stability of the church is a real plus that history and leadership of our people provide us with wonderful strength
389703 no one dreamed we would have the size of the church we have now
389704 it has had its ups and downs but it remains strong and steady
389705 sunday school was held at grandmas house which was right behind the 4th and e building
389706 longevity is having the right pastor there for the needs of the church at the time
389707 its been a part of our familys lives all these years
389708 its a neat place with a lot of good history behind it
389709 its quite an emotional time for me when you go to the church all your life
389710 my growth from a 20 year old to today is huge
389711 i like the fact that it means something to them
389712 it makes it valuable to them so its valuable to me
389713 most of the people dont mind us being here were good neighbors but others just ignore us
389714 and we dont always have an answer to all of those hurts but we can help them spiritually
389715 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
389716 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
389717 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
389718 it should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one
389719 he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one
389720 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
389721 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
389722 be careful when you go home tonight there are ghosts wandering about
389723 be careful in the toilet dont talk to anyone in there in case theyre a you know
389724 dont look now but i think theres someone behind you
389725 no lah theres one guy sitting on the leftmost seat in the first row
389726 there appears to be a configuration error you have associated konqueror with inode directory but it cannot handle this file type

389728 tijdens een vergadering kwam hij zelden actief op de voorgrond

389730 due to the increased impact of the chinese marketplace an output of 2 7 trillion in 2006 we at echineselearning have seen a tremendous demand for chinese education across all professional fields ages geographies and cultures there are in fact over 30 million people throughout the world studying chinese

389738 i came here to this tournament to look at my team for the game against portsmouth and i need to prepare my team for that game
389739 if i have a chance to put three or four more players into the game i will if not i will follow my idea for the game against portsmouth
389740 its definitely clear that the rs is not part of such a scenario because she has her legitimacy
389741 the problem is that some people in sarajevo should wake up look left and right and realise that the rs is there it will remain there permanently
389742 just one of the ideologists of the project of genocide and ethnic cleansing
389743 karadzic and his followers have invented such a project which was realised because of active and continuous participation of all institutions of the self proclaimed republika srpska
389744 not only to determine his individual responsibility for the project of genocide and ethnic cleansing but also for the correction of the effects of that project
389745 working in this market outside of la for a company like purple onion really served this piece for the label and the band they love the piece and it was great to inject some milwaukee aesthetic to get there on what we wanted to achieve for this
389746 getting a shot to come back home and showcase a group of creatives that are homegrown and milwaukee based was a great thing to do having a destination like mtv to communicate that things are happening outside of new york and la was important to us and i hope to be working in milwaukee with the purple onion team more and more in the future
389747 i thought it might get up the middle and it did
389748 but it so happened that our shortstop was all over it
389749 ochoa and burriss havent had the at bats that velez has had to this point
389750 we want to see more of them than eugenio well play a few games here and well have to decide whether to keep velez here or whether he should go down to triple a fresno and play
389751 it wouldnt serve any purpose to have him up here as a pinch runner or pinch hitter
389752 they appreciate the things that have happened in the past and whats to happen for the future
389753 its something ive wanted to do for a long long time
389754 i was an officer and he was a sergeant first class
389755 when you try to please everyone you are a failure in life
389756 each time i find myself flat on my face i pick myself up and get back in the race
389757 one of these days im going to get a life
389758 its something ive wanted to do for a long long time
389759 wac major herstory a black woman in the white mans army
389760 it began as a catharsis for me a way to purge everything that had built up inside me over the years
389761 i guess i was recapturing all of those experiences in the military
389762 being a black woman one who was an officer at that in the military was not for the most part a pleasant time i put everything into manuscript form and then began placing excerpts on my blog friends classmates and former army comrades began encouraging me to write the book so i decided to jump in with both feet
389763 it was january 1961 and i had completed two years of studies at california state teachers college
389764 i majored in biology and then switched to the teachers curriculum but i knew i didnt want to be a teacher so i decided to look for something else
389765 the army recruiting office was located along that busy street and i was enticed by a big poster of a man pointing directly at me with the message uncle sam wants you
389766 did uncle sam really want lenora byrd the recruiter sgt 1st class burkhardt i dont remember his first name convinced me he did
389767 on my first pass off post i was startled the ku klux klan marching unopposed down the main streets of anniston a hop skip and jump from the fort
389768 i was mystified to discover that blacks could not frequent restaurants or hotels and that the water fountains and bathrooms were marked colored and white i could not identify with the trials and tribulations of the southern black people i was in a foreign place this cant be the promised land that will permit me to be all i can be i thought the only way i could deal with this unfamiliar discrimination was to be calm and cool and use humor because being hostile and rebellious would only get me into deep trouble
389769 i was an officer and he was a sergeant first class
389770 but officers dating enlisted personnel was a definite taboo my superiors were not at all pleased with this kind of fraternization once i became pregnant i was forced to resign my commission and leave the army
389771 i learned that later when i accepted the fact that i was gay but it did bring this wonderful girl into my life and i am deeply grateful to god for chantay
389772 the other rotc staff were reluctant to accept me they said i was too old that at 36 i wouldnt be able to relate to the students in the rotc program they claimed i couldnt keep up with the demanding physical pace of training the other officers were younger of course and couldnt or wouldnt look at the broader picture that is they didnt take into account my military experience
389773 i firmly believe some of her cal u colleagues wanted me to fail but i was determined that would not happen
389774 i prayed to god for his guidance and that helped me strengthened my resolve to succeed
389775 i received the honor of playing shortstop our team even played in a tournament in mexico city during the 1968 olympics
389776 frustration and anger overcame me when i the only black female on the team constantly experienced discrimination in hotels and restaurant during our softball travels
389777 my emotions were somewhat softened when my coach and my teammates tried to protect me from this racism they always refused to frequent facilities that discriminated against me
389778 benny gabriel who played guitar was the one who encouraged me
389779 he suggested i learn to play the bass guitar but my mother couldnt afford lessons so i taught myself ace carlin was the leader of the group and a darn good organist ace owned an old hearse and we packed all of our gear in the back of the vehicle ace and benny and the others would chaperone me you know keep an eye on me when we played the clubs and lounges
389780 we would add musicians as we moved from town to town
389781 i remember we had a sax player from monessen and a drummer from donora it was a great experience for a young girl and it helped me mature we traveled a lot and i was making 20 a night that was a lot of money in those days and i was able to help my mother
389782 so if im at a club where hes playing he always invites me to sit in with his group for a set or two hes a great guy and its always fun jamming with him
389783 mom spent the majority of her youth as a caregiver as she nurtured me my grandmother and a nephew
389784 then she took on the task of raising my daughter when i became the breadwinner by serving in the army she never married and it astounds me when i realize how long she lived alone
389785 it taught me to be disciplined organized attentive to detail self confident assertive and to accept the cards dealt to me but to try to play them to win
389786 as the saying goes what you see is what you get
389787 im a black woman who is gay and who can be stubborn outspoken impulsive loving and kind you either accept me or you reject me at age 66 i have no qualms about my lifestyle and sexual orientation and simply try to live a decent rewarding life
389788 i think its something many people can relate to no matter what their gender or race might be
389789 my object was to get away from brownsville and be adventurous
389790 wac major herstory a black woman in the white mans army
389791 i will do whatever it takes to endure the psychological and physical challenges that i will face during basic training i will learn in order to grow
389792 when i start something i make it a habit to finish it
389793 during my military career things got harder instead of easier but my last assignment was pretty good
389794 it taught me to be disciplined organized attentive to detail self confident assertive and to accept the cards dealt to me but try to play them to win
389795 its important for a campus building to match its surroundings
389796 we did not expect the kids to be so joyful
389797 it was a shock its hard to believe theyd go that far with the project and then quit
389798 it was totally unexpected we were supposed to work tomorrow
389799 in our initial assessment we think for the most part there is enough work in the pipeline that most folks will get absorbed rather quickly
389800 i was getting the feeling from boyd that they would start manning up just as citycenter was manning down and they would roll that workforce into the echelon
389801 the one thing we had to look forward to was all the construction jobs until the casinos come online
389802 this kind of puts a damper on everyones sense of where the future is
389803 but the people who have money are still spending money and obviously were not a low end operation
389804 i dont want to say cheap thats not a good word the least expensive car is the lotus
389805 its more like a country club we prefer to call it a country club
389806 its like you can call and reserve a tee time
389807 i think the governor might be making an appearance at this fight
389808 hes seen some of my other fights on tv hes always been very interested in boxing and hes followed mixed martial arts as it has evolved as a sport
389809 we got a really warm welcome from the soldiers a really good response from them they respect what we do just as we respect what theyre doing over there
389810 17 acres of city owned streets and alleyways which previously had been vacated at no additional expense to the buyer
389811 still exist today and have the potential to be negotiated with the sale of this project
389812 weve been saying from the beginning that they wanted the entitlements just to increase the value of the property so they could flip it
389813 the rei neon project was a hoax from beginning to end
389814 this came as a package with all parcels i dont think any individual parcel is capable of carrying the gaming enterprise district on its own
389815 overall plan does not materialize is there in effect a gaming enterprise district that exists separate and apart i think the answer is no
389816 i dont think rei could go back now and say oh without the arena we still have a casino project
389817 i would be extremely upset if rei took that position at any time or if any transferee from rei ever took that position
389818 i would expect that the city council would look with disfavor on any attempt to put a casino here without all the other amenities
389819 the key issue has been a gap in financing for which the developers are looking to the city for assistance
389820 i cannot address the gaming entitlement as that is not my responsibility nor am i a gaming attorney
389821 anything is possible there are a lot of raised eyebrows even more so now i know very few people here friends in law enforcement that buy this story like the rest of the world has
389822 ive been doing this search and rescue for 14 years fossett should have been found
389823 recent comments attributed to ryan regarding the search for fossett contain errors of fact appear to be taken out of context and were not released with the knowledge or approval of cap
389824 was probably as exasperated as anyone else when you cant find something its never our intent to hypothesize or any of that
389825 right now we have no credible evidence suggesting anything other than fossetts plane crashed somewhere in nevada
389826 not a great deal of resources are being focused on this
389827 we have a couple of people reviewing the material but theyre not even working on it full time
389828 its such a large area with so many canyons it could swallow a small airplane pretty easily
389829 why would he do this the wealth he had the notoriety he had why go into hiding
389830 he liked the notoriety he was very much a social individual
389831 he writes most of his articles on entertainment like brad pitts toothbrush but the british love the americana that nevada can offer brothels las vegas and elaborate conspiracies
389832 i saw a great opportunity and called palms owner george maloof
389833 i told him i think theres some real flair here i think it fits your property
389834 i respected him i said he was a great fighter and he came in here and tried to bash me its because hes scared when people are scared out of fear they do dirty things when youre a real champion you dont have to do that you can walk around with your head held high
389835 im no 1 and im not going to lose to him ive been waiting for this too long the only thing i care about is this fight
389836 i said to him if you want to fight me lets do this now
389837 he backed down he shied away and that was it i moved on with my career
389838 fighting in the big leagues and beating the big boys
389839 so many providers have more than half of their clients being subsidized
389840 its really hard to go without a paycheck every year its a waiting game
389841 we have a number of grants that we get through the state
389842 we believe at some point the budget will be approved but if it doesnt happen relatively quickly all of our reserves will go down the tubes
389843 its a really crazy way to do business we have to pull money out of our reserves to survive while they determine if they are going to fund us
389844 we are not at the point now where were in danger but in the next 30 days we will be
389845 the medi cal funded residential facilities are the ones that have to borrow money to keep their doors open
389846 weve been checking on them and they all have resources to stay open
389847 as far as we can tell there arent any of them in immediate danger of closing their doors we can at least get through august without having to borrow money to stay open
389848 one of my biggest concerns is that the state has frozen the rates we pay providers of service
389849 they wont be able to continue to service people with developmental disabilities
389850 because state payments have lagged so far behind what it costs to operate
389851 were losing case workers in every county and the number of nurses is down
389852 our goal is to reinforce the value of this program
389853 weve met with legislative leaders and now were meeting with someone in the governors office to explain why this program shouldnt be cut
389854 if one or both couldnt function the result would be chaos
389855 it all boils down to people not wanting to have egg on their faces
389856 our death is not an end if we can live on in our children and the younger generation for they are us our bodies are only wilted leaves on the tree of life
389857 thousands of graduation speeches have included lyrics from time of your life
389858 give it a rest and actually the real name of the song is good riddance its an angry breakup song green day intended the lyrics to be sarcastic not sentimental
389859 you dont have to wait for them to come in the mail
389860 people who are planning to get married often times are very nervous and they dont feel adept at writing their own vows
389861 me and other web sites take a lot of the anxiety away from the whole process
389862 because there are plenty of people out there who want a little help especially with things that are verbal
389863 it was a time when people were being driven more and more to informality
389864 people often think they have to be really funny or say something extraordinary
389865 sometimes a very simple statement or blessing or thought is the most effective and most memorable
389866 we dont really get into details like that about our customers unfortunately i cant confirm or deny that
389867 represents a solid level of performance and reflects favorably on ibcs commitment to superior earnings despite the increase in the provision on the energy related creditor
389868 i am pleased with these earnings especially in light of the continued credit turmoil and anxiety existing in the markets today during this crisis the company has maintained its sound credit underwriting standards and a sound investment strategy credit quality continued to be good and capital ratios are at strong levels

389877 the coast guard recovered the body of the 19 year old named ghazalh mohamed al raymi and the also 19 year old young man named salem mohammed from the middle of the sea
389878 that was in the plan all along as we work these guys in im confident we have three quarterbacks that we can win with i feel very good about that but the competition obviously is still going on
389879 i have to pay attention to the reps that i get i have to focus in on what i can control i need to be aware of what i can improve on
389880 its part of the deal with all this stuff going on he wants to see how you deal with it
389881 i think this really truly is about the fact that weve gotten a lot of work in and they wanted me to have a day off when your pitch count gets that high you need a rest
389882 i think im probably the only player who looked forward to coming to training camp
389883 youre out here with these guys we sweat we bleed i know what its like to give everything in a game and come up short i know what its like to give everything and win to not be a part of that was the worst feeling
389884 i have no worries no scares no doubts that i may hurt myself im just going out there and playing

389889 london which is the hub of the world financial market is emerging as one of the viable routes to raise money for bollywood companies

389892 youll need the test results to make the school put her in the high level classes
389893 service should be at the top of the list of priorities
389894 basically customer service is just about delivering on promises made
389895 as an industry its been quite a run over the past 30 to 36 months dramatic shifts in in migration job creation inflation and various shortages but its now all coming back down to earth and im looking forward to the more relaxed pace
389896 there were so many things out of our control in the last while but the market is now becoming more manageable for everybody involved
389897 success comes to those and only those who are obsessed with looking after customers
389898 were going to be getting together shortly to try to develop a corporate strategy regarding customer service
389899 we all know how vital it is but what we want to develop is a strategy to deal with it
389900 when all is said and done though good arent sold products and services are bought

389903 we are organizing this to show our solidarity and support with our tibetans inside tibet who are facing lot of problems under the chinese government rule
389904 this the only thing that we can do because our tibet is a spiritual land so we cannot do such kinds of terrorist things this is the only thing we can do like hunger strikes peaceful march candlelight and sending news to any kind newspaper we cannot do anything more than prayers and requesting all international communities
389905 the freedom of an editor to publish or telecast any news item cannot be subject to the approval or disapproval of a political party
389906 in the instant case the editor of cnn ibn has made it oublic that the investigation into the bribery case is incomplete and only if all the facts are authenticated the channel would telecast the tapes
389907 it is hypothetical maybe the congress and the upa will come back in majority on their own without the support of left parties if at all their support will be needed we hope he karat does not repeat the historic blunder of helping the communal forces in 1977 the cpi m was responsible for bringing jan sangh in the mainstream politics they supported the government in which atal behari vajpayee and l k advani were in the cabinet for the first time
389908 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
389909 that the interpretation of the indian government regarding the corrective measures mentioned in the preamble of the safeguards agreement providing for a check against disruption of fuel supplies does not hold has been made clear by the iaea
389910 this belies the prime ministers assurance in parliament that indias civilian nuclear facilities would be put under perpetual iaea safeguards only under the strictly reciprocal condition of uninterrupted fuel supply guarantee
389911 the issue was simple it related to the international agreement on cooperation in nuclear energy that our government is proposing to finalise with the iaea our needs for electricity are so great and growing that we cannot depend only on coal and water resources we have to use nuclear energy in a big way
389912 i do want to emphasise one point to the attempts made by some of our political opponents to give a communal colour to the nuclear agreement this must be condemned in the strongest possible terms this agreement will benefit india and all indians irrespective of caste language region or religion
389913 if the political compulsions of sp in the past compelled them to take positions that the bjp took benefit from now it will be the opposite the bsp even if driven to the bjp fold as a result will not precipitate a dangerous divide between communities whatever else it might do
389914 its not about the sp sharing the upas anti incumbency factor it is about the image of the congress in up and in the entire country if and when sp leaders become the face of the upa government it is also about the morale of our party workers in up who were talking about corruption in sp regime just about a year ago
389915 despite the current economic downturn in the united states venture capitalists are still putting money to work across multiple industries and stages of development

389920 as the end of the transition period is less than a year away i call on the somali people to remain united and solve their political problems
389921 the authorities should remain focused on peace and i hope to see them shortly i call on the president the speaker the prime minister and all members of the parliament to move forward i also call on the ars to continue to encourage reconciliation
389922 i welcome this important step by the transitional federal government and the alliance for the re liberation of somalia and their continuing commitment to the agreement
389923 we must keep moving forward to ensure the agreement is fully implemented as soon as possible
389924 we are delighted to announce this new and historic agreement for womens football
