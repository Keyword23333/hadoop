5920000 there are two powers that alone can effect in their conjunction the great and difficult thing which is the aim of our endeavor a fixed and unfailing aspiration that calls from below and a supreme grace from above that answers
5920001 if we start quite simply without preconceptions armed with an open truth and a total confidence in the integral possibilities of man we shall perhaps have a chance to arrive at an integral knowledge and so at an integral life
5920002 there is general agreement among students of religion that aurobindo was a remarkable mystic but few are willing to swallow the claim of some of his followers that he was an avatar like krishna chaitanya or christ
5920003 his was a spirit that stooped from larger spheres into our province of ephemeral sight carrying with him the strength of the original permanence
5920004 in the issue of sri aurobindo archives and research for december 1987 the archives notes are partly aimed at settling certain queries raised by statements of the writer peter heehs two years earlier in the same periodical his new statements too have come in for criticism it may be that his true drift has failed to be caught but the cause of the failure if any must lie at his own door for whatever his intentions a persistent trend in his way of putting things has led to an impression of inaccuracy and of hazing the real posture of some extraordinary events we are now concerned only with one particular theme of his which call for serious reconsideration what role did the man named parthasarathy iyengar play in sri aurobindos connection with pondicherry parthasarathy was the secretary for the swadeshi steam navigation company which the iyengar family was financially supporting for patriotic reasons during his tour in northern india in that capacity he met sri aurobindo in calcutta and discussed the nationalist and cultural activities in which both the parties were engaged sri aurobindos meeting with pathasarathy is confirmed by his own diary note of tuesday 20 july 1909 which was meant to remind him of the appointment
5920005 we have seen that sri aurobindo came to pondicherry at the suggestion of no one but the obedience to a divine command de a but by speaking to sri aurobindo about pondicherry parthasarathy may have played an instrumental role in his coming
5920006 to suspend all considerations of the political and other circumstances surrounding his departure
5920007 i think it at least plausible that the de a that directed sri aurobindo to go to pondicherry operated within a nexus of forces that included the attempts of the british to have him arrested and the recently established contact between him and the revolutionaries of pondicherry
5920008 i have no difficulty in accepting that sri aurobindo came to pondicherry as a result of an de a and at the same time accepting that there were political factors behind his departure
5920009 link between the de a at chandernagore and sri aurobindos finding a suitable residence in pondicherry among solicitous friends
5920010 he heard the voice suddenly which spoke directly three words go to chandernagore ten minutes later sri aurobindo took the first boat down the ganges and was gone this was the end of his political life the end of the integral yoga
5920011 and the beginning of the supramental yoga he found the secret at chandernagore in 1910 and worked on it for forty years he gave up his life for this

5920081 some provinces due to their wealth of oil or whatever can pick up the additional costs and maintain support for their arts and their film industries but others cant and this would be one
5920082 what do our artists and filmmakers do do they live in poverty or do they move
5920083 in a province like this where the amount of money were talking for the arts is rather small organizations like mine and like all the others count on those dollars to leverage investment into the arts

5920097 its not right that someone should have to feel scared in their own home
5920098 your own home is where you should feel safe our police are doing all they can to solve these crimes

5920196 it was a nice rehearsal the effort was extremely good was it perfect no we made some mistakes we did some things we have to get corrected we understand that we are about 10 days away from the game we turn our focus to a small number of mental errors that we have to get fixed if we do that well be fine
5920197 thats the only thing that i would like to have differently we ran exactly what we wanted to run this was the exact schedule we are blessed to have an indoor facility to come in and get to work i would like to have been in the stadium only for the use of the clock and the comfort of the surroundings
5920198 they completed about 50 percent of their passes and they threw for right at 100 yards it was a productive day for those guys i like the freshman quarterback jefferson he continues to get better and compete and that is very important as you go forward as he continues that progress he is a guy that we can look to play at times i am pleased to a point but there is a lot of work to get accomplished we have to improve but i like our effort and where we are
5920199 he wanted to go but we wanted to make sure he was fresh when we started preparation for appalachian state so we kept him out

5920547 lo que pasa es que seguimos recibiendo goles muy temprano goles apretados pero que al cabo cuestan y cuentan nos ponen en complicaciones falta un poco de manejo de partido y recibimos muchas tarjetas
5920548 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution are pointed towards china
5920549 it would be impossible to understand haiti without knowing its music art and dance
5920550 as i make my way there very conscious of guyanas problems and still very irritated by the lack of information available about carifesta goings on i nevertheless will take every opportunity offered to revel in the arts
5920551 that is why you guys are rather hated by ordinary chinese
5920552 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution are pointed towards china
5920553 the pentagon meanwhile said it will be reviewing the needs of the georgian military battered in more than four days of all out fighting with russian forces over the breakaway region of south ossetia

5920560 matt 17 also i agree with gary it always seems like america is blamed for everything we do genocide happening in a country we go in to stop it and we get blamed for any violence that occurs maybe america should stop helping other countries other then their allies when they need aid then lets see what happens as the world falls apart even faster
5920561 president bush secretly authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on americans and others inside the united states to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying according to government officials

5920567 from the blogs i am familiar with and talking to my family and friends i would have to say that they are not replacing our journalism and print media at all
5920568 depoliticization as far national politics is concerned is a fact among mainstream tunisians
5920569 who wants to take the risk venturing into the woods inhabited by those we dont speak of on the blogsphere
5920570 i think that much of this fear and this politicophobia is based on myths that can easily be surmounted if the concerned parties within the blogsphere show a bit of comprehension and moderation
5920571 a true blogger cannot conceive his activity without being committed to defend the tool that hes using blogging is initially a state of mind an attitude and the intransigence towards all those trying to harm the two amazing tools we own expression and the internet
5920572 praise the blogs as being the ultimate space for freedom political militancy dissidence and subversive ideas
5920573 so please spare us the speeches about the iranian and the egyptian blogsphere it is just a question of large numbers the day well get thousands of tunisian blogs there will be a few political and militant blogs among theme
5920574 project 119 to win more medals pretty easily seeing as how we can fake passports and birth certificates here in the us where the process is more closely monitored

5920576 i hope to be a winner for what i have been trained hard for
5920577 now my dream came true i have won a gold medal many said that i look like just underage too young
5920578 i thought it is good to have a nice younger look
5920579 my instructor did not train me to look older for the competitions
5920580 ultimately i believe that it is my skill level that win the gold medal in the competitons
5920581 there has been a controversy as to her actual age
5920582 and if she is really 14 as of 2008 then its not at all a case of sore loser syndrome for usa its a matter of not playing by the rules if the rules are legally changed and the minimum age is 14 then thered be no controversy no one would have any problems all countries can openly use younger girls and everyone would be playing by the same rules
5920583 if the rules are legally changed to age 14 then theres no controversy
5920584 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution are pointed towards china
5920585 those are the medias of unionist western sahraouis the ones supporting the autonomy initiative under the moroccan sovereignty
5920586 a youth guy who dont care about this stuffs but i want say enought
5920587 victimes of the polisario call the international community to stop the agony of the sequestered

5920589 i think dr nick has gived you more time than you deserve
5920590 nick i will say it differently its time for you to shut up
5920591 let us make our propaganda and please do not interfere in such discussions with pro moroccan sahraouis
5920592 there are settlers and there are natives both say the land is theirs international law says the natives are right but might is on the side of the settlers who have built an impregnable wall to keep out the refugees who fled the country when the newcomers arrived three decades ago endless peace negotiations have got nowhere settlement continues and the natives grow ever more angry and desperate
5920593 i have seen a few months ago a picture on internet of the prison of laayoune where people were stacked on each other in a large sleep the picture doesnt make sense it was used by many medias on internet without any investigation besides people inside the prison were not all sahraouis few of them were sahraouis
5920594 the problem with you guys from the west you believe the first one to talk
5920595 tunisian blogs and sites have been censored then those of civil society then those of legitimate political parties now the stupidity of ben alis regime is attacking dailymotion one rare remaining space of freedom for tunisians
5920596 whats behind this news tunisians are protesting on the net
5920597 can a virtual action on the net have an impact on the real political life
5920598 the tunisian government does not permit any opposition whether in the traditional press or on the internet
5920599 draw attention to what is happening in my country as regards the repression against all those who voice dissent
5920600 bettibi was treated violently and his books and cds were confiscated from his home even though there was no court order to do take these items
5920601 nobody will be above serbian interests even if his name is ratko mladic
5920602 until then nothing changed management stayed more or less the same trying to find mechanisms to raise their salaries they traveled everywhere around the world to find strategic investor but i believe they were not trying hard enough knowing that if a private owner comes in their positions may come at risk
5920603 they made at least ten announcements saying contract signing with foreign corporation is coming closer however the only thing they did is a deal to produce old model of fiats punto of course i could not get employment then i am a 50 year old engineer holding a university degree and the only place i can find a job is at a fast food restaurant think how humiliated i would feel after 30 years of work at the office to start flipping burgers at some local shop
5920604 everybody sees that the countrys export trade deficit will be more than seven billion dollars this government has to find mechanisms to stimulate exporters on the contrary what they do is stimulate import i think this is a forced measure because ministry of finance is trying to prove it can keep one digit inflation this year it is better to have higher inflation if it helps the economy growth overall
5920605 because they just let me do what i wanted to do
5920606 there are people in the record industry today that control it that can not keep time to a march
5920607 were truly into the music itself they could feel it
5920608 even if the union leadership was not involved in the dismissal of our colleagues why did they refuse to lift a finger to help them
5920609 a purge organised by the president of the union abdullah karacan
5920610 no one can say today whether the police officers committed a tragic blunder or if they were acting in legitimate self defense
5920611 a great number of individuals rushed toward the police agents and attacked them one of the police agents then opened fire toward the suspects hitting three of them
5920612 i dont know what ran through the mind of the police agents but it is really unfair
5920613 they were six one cant know for sure what the young man could have done or said but it doesnt matter they were not twenty and they didnt grab the police agents
5920614 we were six guys and two girls we approached but we didnt touch them
5920615 there was a game of dice we were having fun myself my brother and his friends a police car emerged behind us we were in the middle of the park we moved back the police agent came right at me and told me i saw you play dice come here he wanted to arrest me i had initially maintained a distance from him then i got closer he grabbed my hand he wanted to handcuff me i said why are you doing this i didnt do anything wrong he was pressing hard at a certain point my arm began to hurt i was also struggling to straighten up my arm the other police agent came and they threw me on the hood of the car i managed to get up the police agent took me by the neck and tripped me up its at this point that my brother came he said what are you doing let go of my brother why are you doing this and then i just heard gun shots i saw my brother down on the ground
5920616 i dont even know what progress the investigation has made what is going on nothing
5920617 absolutely nothing indicates that montreals police agents are a pack of racist thugs
5920618 the relationship between young men and the police in these hot areas is very difficult
5920619 if you are male a member of a visible minority and drive a sports car you can be targeted
5920620 one youth told me he was stopped 10 times in one day that is a lot and i think the young people are fed up
5920621 a study i co directed in 1996 to understand the social trajectory of young haitians living in this neighborhood found that a majority of them had been aggressively called over by police agents during routine checks the term most frequently used by law enforcement officers was the word nigger
5920622 in revolt because they dont like the way they are being treated they dont like how authorities interact with them
5920623 dignify the stealing of meat from small butcher shops or the burning of cars as an expression of oppressed youth
5920624 its normal that things boil over when so many kids lack goals and occupations they must be motivated by engaging them in activities its impressive to see how one can revive the flame thanks to a school journal a theater piece or a visit to the museum unfortunately the budgets are never there and with the education reform artistic oriented activities were slashed half of the professionals lost their jobs
5920625 we will not allow the kurdish peoples achievements to be wrecked by the iraqi parliament iraq will fall apart if the constitution is violated
5920626 it is tense in kirkuk quite frankly it is tense because of the debate over the elections and thats just something that the iraqi people will have to work out among themselves but i have confidence that they will in a peaceful means as long as some of the people dont flare it up with false reporting
5920627 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5920628 take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5920629 the answer is no i think we have in place what we should have
5920630 trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5920631 we have to be prepared to talk we cannot afford to isolate russia
5920632 imagine if we were forced to intervene militarily on behalf of georgia as a nato country on behalf of an obvious gambler which is clearly the way one ought to characterize georgian president mikheil saakashvili georgia and ukraine must first resolve their domestic political problems and they are still a long way off i see the chances of georgian accession becoming even more remote as a result of the recent events in the caucasus and in this connection i have great difficulties following the rather ostentatious promises made by the nato secretary general a few days ago
5920633 the nato russia council is not just a fair weather committee it is needed when we find ourselves in difficult waters
5920634 isolation has been tried in the past and didnt work i favour hard headed engagement
5920635 horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
5920636 not only the west but the rest of the international community must make it clear that this kind of behaviour will result in ostracism and economic and financial penalties ultimately if russia continues on this course it must face isolation in the international community
5920637 a concerted effort on all levels at the united nations in the atlantic council in the eu or in nato in consultation with the japanese the chinese and others
5920638 european russia a siberian republic and a far eastern republic
5920639 this means at the same time a massive incursion into the russian sphere of influence following iran russia is now trapped in the cross hairs of us geo politics
5920640 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5920641 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5920642 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia iran is pursuing nuclear weapons
5920643 the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the ceasefire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5920644 we have lost over a thousand american lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars since the surge began but iraqs leaders still havent made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country
5920645 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the government is sitting on a 79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits
5920646 iraqi inaction threatens the progress weve made and creates an opening for iran and the special groups it supports
5920647 its time to press the iraqis to take responsibility for their future the best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground
5920648 after this redeployment well keep a residual force to target remnants of al qaeda to protect our service members and diplomats and to train iraqs security forces if the iraqis make political progress
5920649 strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5920650 this is a war that we have to win and as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job against the taliban
5920651 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5920652 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5920653 we have to work with musharraf because the biggest threat to american security right now is in the northwest provinces of pakistan
5920654 we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that
5920655 senator mccain and i both strongly support the people of georgia
5920656 some democrats have been pleading with obama to use mccains tough response to the russian invasion of georgia to paint him as a trigger happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war weary nation into military conflict in regions where the united states has no interest
5920657 northern territory is not by nature a labor kind of place
5920658 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign
5920659 many aboriginal people voted labor in the last federal election because of what howard and minister for aboriginal affairs brough did to us with the intervention
5920660 but in the last 12 months neither the new rudd government nor nt labor has done anything to reverse these destructive policies
5920661 and we will strengthen support for its wish to join nato
5920662 you dont need to be a student of the crushing of the prague spring in 1968 to find the sight of russian tanks rolling into a neighbouring country chilling
5920663 the georgian crisis is about more than vital issues of humanitarian need and rule of law over rule of force it raises a fundamental issue of whether and if so how russia can play a full and legitimate part in a rules based international political system exercising its rights but respecting those of others
5920664 violated successive un security council resolutions which they themselves agreed
5920665 blatantly violated the sovereignty of a neighbouring and democratic country
5920666 is that aggression cannot and will not redraw the map of russias former near abroad or anywhere else
5920667 confirm the commitment made at the nato summit in april to membership for ukraine and georgia and to follow it up with serious co operation militarily and politically as part of a structured route map to eventual membership
5920668 this escalation in tension only makes the question more urgent
5920669 where on earth are gordon brown and his foreign secretary david miliband
5920670 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
5920671 the burst of optimism was so startling it dazzled those too long trapped deep in a dungeon in that one moment it was all over for the old leader who had plunged them into these depths suddenly here was the chance of escape everyone was waiting for
5920672 a man who has often seemed too fastidious for frontline politics
5920673 he may find that the locks at 10 downing street have been changed
5920674 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
5920675 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
5920676 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
5920677 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
5920678 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
5920679 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
5920680 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both with multiple audiences
5920681 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
5920682 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
5920683 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
5920684 its absolutely true that the complexity that has brought to medicare during his two terms in office has been unfortunate
5920685 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5920686 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5920687 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5920688 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
5920689 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
5920690 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5920691 all i can do is be me whoever that is
5920692 he feels great hes feels like hes ready to throw off the mound and hes excited about it
5920693 its really a risk versus reward thing with him wed have to be assured that theres no risk involved i know hed like to throw off the mound for his peace of mind going into the winter but at the same time if theres any risk involved we wont do it
5920694 from a selfish standpoint i would have loved to have kept him around because he was a pro and was a big part of this ballclub both last year and this year but from a business standpoint we got the best deal that we could
5920695 he had that no trade provision in his contract and there was only one place he wanted to go so it kind of hurt us from a leverage standpoint but hopefully well be able to extract a couple good prospects from the dodgers
5920696 i certainly enjoyed having greg here the last year and a half
5920697 its always difficult to move him within the division especially the dodgers
5920698 this guy was willing to stay he thoroughly enjoyed his experience in san diego even though we werent winning he was willing to grind it out for the next six weeks and remain a padre he pretty much put it in my hands
5920699 were 16 games out in a month and a half hes going to be a free agent it was either we keep him here on a ballclub thats losing or hopefully extract a couple prospects that will hopefully impact our club here in the future
5920700 we certainly never would have made this deal if we were in contention right now but were not what we had to weigh was six or seven more starts of greg maddux what does that do for us as an organization
5920701 great for the pitchers great for the position players great for the coaching staff great for the organization one of the most enjoyable guys that ive managed
5920702 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5920703 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5920704 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5920705 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5920706 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5920707 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5920708 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5920709 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5920710 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5920711 i wasnt lucky to have someone to guide me when i came up with the angels
5920712 but im going to treat sandoval like a son i already told him that im here for him and that i want to help him learn the game and guide him as much as i can
5920713 i was lucky to learn a lot about catching in single a with steve decker as my coach
5920714 now im just thrilled to be up here with a chance to play i dont care if i play first base or catcher or wherever i just want to help out and take advantage of this opportunity
5920715 hes played some third and were going to keep our options open hes got good hands you never know the way the game goes if we can find a way to get his bat in there we will
5920716 hes handled himself well at the plate and defensively the game he played at first he showed some athleticism hes been very impressive in the early going
5920717 he can throw he hits for power and average and he wants to learn
5920718 im going to help him as much as i can i want to work with him so that when he gets in there he can help us win and be as prepared as possible
5920719 mike scioscia changed my career scioscia had so much experience and knowledge and he taught me everything and im grateful for that
5920720 im going to treat pablo like a son and he knows that
5920721 we had 10 years after the cold war to build a new world order and yet we squandered them
5920722 those countries with a focus on inflation fighting will for the time being be relatively aggressive and prevent their currencies from depreciating
5920723 if policy makers are really defocusing on inflation and looking more at growth that may on balance lead them to intervene less aggressively than they had before
5920724 if they need to relax their hold on intervention they have to see confirmation of the decline in oil prices and other commodities having an impact on inflation
5920725 they have a significant inflation problem sufficient comfort with their growth outlook and enough reserves to intervene
5920726 the drivers of asian currencies may change but the pressure for depreciation in a range of jurisdictions will persist
5920727 its not as easy to throw 120 pitches like it used to be you play with what youve got if you keep your team in the game for six or seven innings you let everyone else do their thing
5920728 id like to believe we have somebody who can get us eight innings if you cant fill the rest of the game youre not good enough to do anything
5920729 i definitely pitched a lot better once he got here
5920730 he helped me in so many ways i cant say exactly which ways but we spent a lot of time watching video and he helped me understand how to attack hitters it will be fun to get back to that situation
5920731 he will stabilize the rotation we all know what he can do but especially with a young staff its not even so much what he does the day he pitches but what he does the other four days that he doesnt pitch you watch the game with him and he talks about the game you pick his brain about how he pitches certain hitters thats invaluable so theres more than his wins and losses theres his knowledge and just the presence of having him
5920732 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
5920733 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
5920734 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
5920735 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
5920736 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
5920737 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
5920738 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
5920739 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
5920740 i think theres such sufficient understanding at the most senior levels of this campaign of the importance of the pro family constituency that im very comfortable with how the selection process is proceeding
5920741 nobody has called me regarding the vice presidency from the mccain campaign
5920742 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
5920743 effectively destroyed the republican party and pushed the conservative movement into the bleachers
5920744 when you are attacked normally you will fight back that was what happened in mamasapano
5920745 we have internal investigation and we will penalize them if found guilty
5920746 the reward system is unilateral on the part of the government
5920747 we will defend our field commanders if force is used against them by the government we have mechanism about it and it would be good for all if the mechanism is followed
5920748 i got bottom bunk he got the upper bunk and when hes going to bed its terrible and i got problems too in my back but him when i see him i cant sleep
5920749 when you line up to take medicine he would grab a chair because he couldnt stand and they would tell him he had to let the chair go he had to stand but he couldnt
5920750 continues to investigate allegations that ng was mistreated in any way while in detention
5920751 based on a review of the medical records it appears that ng was examined by medical staff at the facility where he was detained and at the local hospital in rhode island both as a normal course of admission to the facility and for individual complaints he had tragically but not unlike similar situations involving citizens of this country ng was diagnosed with advanced stage cancer and sadly succumbed to the illness within days of the diagnosis
5920752 considering that much of it took place when ice was facing intense scrutiny over the quality of its medical care system and when agency personnel had assured congress that problems had been addressed
5920753 it is going to be easier to make our case on capitol hill now
5920754 as this has reminded poland and some of the other nations formerly dominated by the soviet union that the coercive russia mind set of militarily threatening your neighbors has not completely disappeared
5920755 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5920756 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
5920757 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil
5920758 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real
5920759 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5920760 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5920761 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5920762 if obama were up 10 points i think it would be very viable because he wouldnt have to get anything political out of her
5920763 shes great on policy great on politics he could be confident that she would be a good political adviser and run some things but at two points up she doesnt bring anything politically
5920764 wow flat and boring what state is she from again
5920765 pretty funny stuff originally aired in july of this year
5920766 its exciting to be involved in something that relates to our industry
5920767 and its a great opportunity for us to be associated with a high quality team like don schumacher racing were looking forward to great results with the pro stock motorcycle team and craig treble
5920768 now that we have the two riders secured at dsr craig will begin testing our new hayabusa engine as soon as we have it available which should be shortly after indy
5920769 and with ellis tartaglia and treble putting their focus on this program well work towards accomplishing some wonderful things with the new hayabusa suzuki engine
5920770 i was prepared to leave team tigue at the end of the race on sunday without a plan for indy
5920771 ive been with harry and joanne lartigue for four years and its been a great run with them we won a few races together including the u s nationals last year
5920772 ive also had a long association with vance and hines since day one in the psm class and i want to thank them for all the years of providing great engines
5920773 the airline flying to melbourne is yet another impressive aviation victory facilitated by the brumby government with more direct flights meaning more business more trade and ultimately more jobs for the victorian economy
5920774 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5920775 i would expect that the prime minister would be applying maximum diplomatic pressure to frank bainimarama to see that elections return to fiji as soon as is possible
5920776 every diplomatic effort needs to be applied by australia new zealand the countries in the south west pacific and indeed throughout the commonwealth to apply pressure to commodore bainimarama to return power in fiji to the fijians themselves
5920777 herman wouks work epitomizes the historical novel and its ability to transcend its time and place to achieve universality in character and themes billington said
5920778 the library of congress holds a unique place in america and for me personally as a collector and preserver of our nations great intellectual and creative heritage so it is a special honor for me to receive this award said wouk thank you for recognizing my lifes work
5920779 i think theres a strong case for the reserve bank to move by a larger amount by 0 5 per cent particularly given that at the beginning of a rate cut cycle its best to have your biggest move because thats when its safest to make the move because thats when rates are at their highest
5920780 i think everyones entirely confident that well see a rate cut on september 2
5920781 sometimes we as hitters as players put a little too much pressure on ourselves
5920782 youve still got to see the ball and hit the ball its not like hes going to make up a pitch with the bases loaded
5920783 we just have to pick up the slack and do the best we can at this point i dont even know what else the organization can do
5920784 its nice to be on the other end of one of those games someone elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt its amazing how that works sometimes
5920785 its the toughest situation a bullpen can be put in and every reliever should crave it i know i do
5920786 i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i paid for it it doesnt matter how many times you get a guy out the one time you dont stinks
5920787 i think i just got the jitters its a different atmosphere once i settled down i did good
5920788 to hold them right there probably was the turning point in the game
5920789 achieved further retail presence for air drives and air drives inaudible in the us and uk
5920790 we have over 4 500 sq ft of gallery space but we could barely get into the building when the submissions came in
5920791 we were absolutely overwhelmed with the response and our judging panel had some really tough choices to make when selecting the 71 works which make up the exhibition
5920792 what is particularly exciting is that the award has attracted artists of all ages and backgrounds they range from art college graduates to royal academicians
5920793 the selectors have now chosen which shortlisted piece will receive the 10 000 federation of british artists selectors choice however as this wont be announced until 3 september its going to be fascinating to see if the selectors choice reflects that of the voting public
5920794 for four days all weve seen is russian tv they make us georgians look like such animals
5920795 some ossetians came and stole some cars and robbed some stores of groceries but there werent too many problems
5920796 ossetians attacked us they stole all our cars didnt leave a single one
5920797 there was nothing left of the village many homes were still burning
5920798 they poured gasoline on houses and lit them on fire every day
5920799 the russians were normal the ossetians stole cows pianos cars and killed everything there is not a person a dog a chicken left alive
5920800 without visiting sunday bazaar one cannot say he has visited kashgar
5920801 despite the softening new zealand economy the new zealand business delivered a record result for the first half with the ebit in local currency terms increasing by 18 1 per cent on volume growth of 3 4 per cent
5920802 powerade was the standout performer for the half year growing by over 15 per cent as a result of the launch of powerade edge and recovery
5920803 this project will generate material efficiency savings and will significantly enhance new zealands customer service capability
5920804 whether how and for how long vera resisted arrest how vera was restrained whether such restraint was excessive or objectively unreasonable
5920805 these officers say they did not see mr vera talk hear him talk say anything or see him move
5920806 but the three defendants contend mr vera fought them right up to the very end
5920807 the evidence we developed shows that in order for him to have suffered the type of brain injury he suffered he had to have been without oxygen for at least five minutes before cpr started

5920811 the sustainability of new zealands existing ports sector investments the industrys ability to invest in the future and the global competitiveness of the countrys supply chain might be assisted by the purchase of port of taurangas container business by ports of auckland
5920812 although the 2007 port of tauranga ports of auckland merger proposal was not successful the rationale for changes in the industry in the upper north island is still strong
5920813 its not about who is the fastest or the strongest its the person who can hold it together when it matters
5920814 you train for these three days you dont train for the grand prix you work all year for three days
5920815 its all about getting to the final and once youre there its all about who has the greatest will to win
5920816 im happy ive won a gold medal and thats all that matters to me
5920817 for a world class 400m runner the quicker you can do a one off 200 the better
5920818 going into this season christine didnt have that her strength was never in doubt but her base speed was
5920819 so this season shes worked more on her short sprints her 100m and 200m and got quicker over the shorter distances
5920820 therefore when she comes to run the first 200m of her 400m shes not wasting as much energy it actually feels easier for her
5920821 ohuruogu will return home to london as the poster girl for the 2012 games
5920822 there is no suggestion that she is guilty of taking drugs
5920823 this is one of britains best ever athletes and he never told drugs
5920824 my personal belief for what it is worth is that she is not a drugs cheat but her actions in missing the drugs tests taint her performance that is my argument and i am sticking to it
5920825 she informed the testers that there had been a change in venue she then tried to drive through london to get to them what did the testers do they went well done so that blows out the argument of post 74
5920826 she had a tough break but she never tested positive so i mean i think that she should have been reinstated
5920827 then take linford christine even diane modal suffered a ban but was late cleared they won their medals clean
5920828 notice the differing treatment of ohuruogo and thanou in the press for example one is innocent one is a drugs cheat
5920829 rio only missed one un announced test not 3 he also realised his error later in the day and called the testers and offered to take the drugs test on the same day the testers refused
5920830 welshbloke post 134 all charges agaisnt thanou have been dropped by the ioc the iaaf and the greek athletics federation
5920831 on a side bar i think that the atheletics should have set trainig venues like the cycling and rowing where all the athletes from paricular desciplines can train together it would mean they are under much more scrutiny it should be if they dont qualify for the camp and attend then they dont get our money just a thought
5920832 if she were german russian or american then the cries of cheat and doper would be deafening but because she is a nice british girl we are happy to believe that she just forgot and that it was all a misunderstanding
5920833 suspicions some people have suspicions that the planet is ruled by lizards who have taken human form
5920834 for you it is understandable for me it is not i feel entitled to that opinion
5920835 fact she missed three drugs tests fact there are steriods that clear the system in 7 days
5920836 and if you do want an argument about intellect feel free i hardly think an ma bsc 4 a levels at grade a 11 o levels and an iq of 152 make me the unintelligent person you keep harping on about
5920837 you then make remarks about those of us who feel ohuruogos medal is tainted ill informed and uneducated on what basis cos we dont agree with you
5920838 and then you finish by suggesting that the only reason sanya richards is faster than ohuruogo is because she is taking something
5920839 look at my iq and qualifications i must be right

5920851 ringback tones are quickly becoming the golden child of the mobile music market due to a winning combination of consumer popularity and minimal impact from drm or piracy
5920852 the current leading mobile premium content category of realtones is already facing challenges consumers increasingly are able to create their own ringtones the price disparity compared to a full track download is also a growing factor
5920853 we are in the process of completing the due diligence
5920854 we will make the announcement in two to three months
5920855 i pretty much got thrown out of the room by the promoter of a mining company because we asked for environment audits

5920867 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5920868 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5920869 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5920870 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5920871 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs

5920876 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5920877 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5920878 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5920879 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5920880 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them

5920894 well just try to match up the best way we can
5920895 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5920896 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5920897 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5920898 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through

5920900 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys

5920909 how to build a better content model for your site understanding news consumption patterns
5920910 publishing for profit and influence its all about the passion
5920911 this site is dedicated to helping other bloggers learn the skills of blogging share their own experiences and promote the blogging medium
5920912 a weblog dedicated to obsessively profiling and reviewing new internet products and companies
5920913 useful descriptive anchor text can be great not only for the user but helpful for google to better understand what that page is likely about on the flip side of things theres the smell test and that if something doesnt smell right smells fishy doesnt look or seem natural thats going to certainly raise a red flag for us
5920914 i think people overemphasize the value of good domain names i would say that while a domain name can be a factor in some ways how we view sites how we view links i would really say that it is relatively a minimal factor
5920915 what we found is that sites that have a lot of links 200 300 or 500 tend to have links that have not been strongly editorially vetted we would rather see fewer links that the webmaster has actually looked over and that they are maintaining to make sure they are still fresh
5920916 if the googlebot sees a page that is pretty much identical to something it has already seen it will automatically make a determination regarding which page makes more sense and it will run with this url in the vast majority of cases it really has no negative affect at all
5920917 anyone whos been part of a writers room knows how exhilarating it can be to work with a great team on an exciting project

5920921 if people understand whats being communicated why does it matter
5920922 what does it matter no one reads this blog anyway
5920923 the most important thing to do is to blog as if no one else was reading you
5920924 while it might be blatantly obvious to you and 99 of your readers that youre not serious you will fool someone perhaps they just read the title perhaps the skim the post and dont see the clues or perhaps they just believe it without question as a result i tend to only play jokes that use my own name or reputation or would advise that if youre going to involve someone else that you might want to check with them first

5920940 i think he has a great chance it is going to be hard fighting the world champion in his own backyard but its what paddy wanted i know that if shiming did beat him he would have to earn it
5920941 i was very confident when he went out that he would do well
5920942 even though the polish guy had beaten him before it did not surprise me when he won paddy has been working on his tactics so when he won 11 5 it shows you that he has been going ok but paddy is out there for the gold and i am confident he can do it

5921059 providing a physical venue to champion this objective is noble enough but we see the need to constantly challenge ourselves and come up with more tools to better equip the indie musicians playing for and with us

5921062 the overwhelming majority of reported rape cases are women being victimized by a male particularly in the context of alcohol
5921063 my main point in cases of rape women are the majority of the victims and men are not

5921102 i really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians the aclu people for the american way all of them who have tried to secularize america i point the finger in their face and say you helped this terrorist attack happen
5921103 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
5921104 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
5921105 children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them
5921106 nothing you do for children is ever wasted they seem not to notice us hovering averting our eyes and they seldom offer thanks but what we do for them is never wasted
5921107 it was a little special im not going to say no
5921108 its special because you know the other team you got traded from
5921109 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5921110 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas

5921112 nadie me dio una raz n l gica de por qu no publicar dice astrada sobre lo que le pas con el material de su serie
5921113 el asesinato de una mujer en el marco de relaciones desiguales de poder entre hombres y mujeres
5921114 las ong en guatemala han reaccionado de manera mezclada nuestra reflexi n interna a n no ha terminado cuenta a las12 sebasti n elgueta investigador del equipo centroam rica de amnist a internacional autor del informe ni protecci n ni justicia homicidio de mujeres la ley tiene aspectos positivos y es que pone el t rmino violencia de g nero y le eleva el perfil incluye apoyo integral para sobrevivientes asistencia legal para v ctimas y el compromiso de proveer financiamiento para estas iniciativas pero en t rminos del procedimiento penal la ley anterior era bastante comprensible para asegurar la persecuci n de los responsables de asesinar mujeres nosotros identificamos que casi nadie era llevado delante de la justicia no por falta de un marco legal adecuado sino por una falta de iniciativa por parte de polic as pero m s que todo de fiscales que son quienes investigan estos cr menes y tambi n por una actitud de discriminaci n hacia las instituciones estatales que tienen que ver la ley es una se al positiva pero no es la rectificaci n de esas limitaciones institucionales
5921115 uno de los indicadores de extrema violencia cuyo fin no s lo es causar la muerte sino hacer sufrir a la persona antes de morir
5921116 la mayor a de los cr menes ocurren entre las 6 de la tarde y las 11 de la noche cuando el hombre suele estar en la casa
5921117 1612 casos son consecuencia del consumo de alcohol en 155 son celos y en 26 drogas
5921118 la mayor a de los casos de muerte violenta de mujeres no son investigados en los que s la investigaci n no se realiza de manera eficiente las autoridades no manejan eficientemente la escena del crimen en muchos casos se justifica el no investigar con la estigmatizaci n de las v ctimas culpando a las mujeres por lo sucedido desacredit ndolas especulando su participaci n en una mara pandilla juvenil por tener alg n tatuaje en el cuerpo o calific ndolas de sexo servidoras si llevan las u as pintadas y minifalda
5921119 en guatemala sintieron que estaba hablando mal de su pa s
5921120 llegu al cuerpo de bomberos recuerda ellos tienen un departamento de prensa que se encarga de avisar a los medios cuando aparece alg n cuerpo u ocurri alg n accidente pero claro los bomberos avisaban a los que consideraban m s de su palo as que para tener mejor v nculo con ellos el primer tiempo me quedaba con ellos hablando com amos juntos me qued a dormir ah hasta que me dijeron andate que te avisamos sintieron que no estaba jugando sino que de verdad estaba haciendo un trabajo serio
5921121 el movimiento de mujeres hace un enorme esfuerzo trabaja en condiciones arriesgadas arriesg ndose a que las maten asegura el investigador de amnesty el esfuerzo de las organizaciones locales ha logrado que se incremente el n mero de fiscales dedicados a la investigaci n ha puesto de relieve el tema y hecho que se lo tome en serio
5921122 estos son los primeros pasos a dar antes de esperar resultados concretos
5921123 el turista normal nunca se ve involucrado en cr menes que hacen noticia debido a que los m viles de estos cr menes no suelen ser m s que un robo o atraco
5921124 escaso empe o demostrado en realizar investigaciones a fondo la ausencia de medidas para la protecci n de los testigos las v ctimas y sus familiares y la falta de informaci n y de datos sobre los casos las causas de la violencia y el perfil de las v ctimas
5921125 es duro ver que el violador o el asesino de tu hija est libre y que presentar una denuncia no sirve para nada es incluso peor acusar a los autores es peligroso porque muchas veces te amenazan a ti
5921126 la ocupaci n de la v ctima es un dato que contribuye a dignificar su muerte ya que se comunica cu les fueron sus aportes a la vida social pol tica y cultural de su pa s
5921127 las declaraciones de las personas cercanas a las mujeres asesinadas son claves para reivindicar su vida en raras oportunidades se les da espacio a las familias para reclamar justicia o para que den a conocer el trato que las autoridades le dan a la investigaci n
5921128 abordar el contexto social y pol tico en el que se presentan los casos contribuir a a que la poblaci n tome conciencia de la situaci n que se vive en el pa s la prensa no pone de manifiesto el c rculo vicioso de la violencia de g nero y c mo afect el entorno de la afectada tampoco muestra objetivamente el perfil que retrate la conducta de los victimarios
5921129 los medios monitoreados est n faltando a compromisos asumidos por el estado guatemalteco en el mbito internacional en materia de derechos humanos derechos de las mujeres y promoci n de nuevas formas de comunicaci n y de informaci n esta tendencia informativa genera percepciones exacerbadas sobre la violencia afecta la participaci n social de las guatemaltecas e inhibe su desarrollo
5921130 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5921131 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5921132 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5921133 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5921134 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5921135 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5921136 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5921137 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5921138 whats more amazing than the fact that these rice terraces has been existing for thousands of years is that they were actually eked out of the mountains by a people who at that time neither had bulldozers power tools nor engineering degrees only a unified community with a tremendous resolve could have pulled off such a task more remarkably the rice terraces are still serving their purpose to this day centuries after they were carved out of the mountainsides and one can actually say that the fruits of the ifugao ancestors labors are still literally being reaped
5921139 it was a difficult thing to do to teach the ifugao children how to perform in half a day and make them come up with a recital performance in the same afternoon theres the dialect barrier to contend with not to mention the great cultural difference between us and the ifugao kids plus the weather was hot and sticky and youd really rather stay in bed or in the shower
5921140 we had the kids perform in the lawn of the tribal gospel missions bible school compound just before sunset the light was perfect and a cool breeze was blowing i didnt see him but somehow i knew that as the kids take the field to give a rendition of jesus parables with such heartfelt enthusiasm god was smiling as he watched
5921141 midway through the project i entertained doubts about rebookeds completion this was after all the fundraising activities did not produce the expected cash inflow books were coming at a slow pace especially at the early stages of preparation and implementation dates were postponed multiple times add to that i faced insecurities about my capacity to lead this project now when i look back those doubting times were actually gods way of redirecting my hearts course if everything went well as we planned them god knows that i may succumb to the temptation of taking the credit but god wasnt teaching me about project management what he wanted me to learn is to depend on his provision for what we need and for the resources necessary for his work it is from him that we desire to bring goodness to others ephesians 2 10 and from him that we obtain the means to do so john 15 5
5921142 will providing books to some far flung school library do much to raise the level of education of the young there
5921143 how does one go out of herself and extend gods goodness to others while making enough room to receive from them and from god given the shortness of time would our group really make any impact or change anything at all then god reminded me that we are not going there to accomplish a task we were not the ones who would do the work he would bring us to ifugao to witness him do his work through rebooked i learned to appreciate more the transforming power of god i realized that his work cant be limited by anything certainly not by the little time or money we had
5921144 its difficult to be selfless to think about other peoples needs before ours
5921145 if a community of primitive farmers can make rice paddies come out of mountains im sure the church can make a harvest of the world and im glad to be part of it
5921146 the bahamas embassy in china is working in the interest of bahamian students in china the embassy is also concerned with causing applications for visas to be processed in a timely manner so that chinese citizens would not be unduly delayed when attempting to travel to the bahamas for business and recreation
5921147 chinese travellers have many choices of vacation destination many of which are much nearer to them we must do all in our power to ensure that chinese travellers to the bahamas are rewarded with efficiency and a dynamic tourism experience
5921148 a part of the mission of the ministry of tourism and aviation is to make it increasingly easy to access bahamas vacations
5921149 of course this means we must find the most convenient and least expensive ways for visitors to enter the country by air and sea
5921150 however it also includes the ease with which they are able to access amenities and enjoy attractions when already in the bahamas communications is no small part of this they must be made to feel comfortable in bahamian surroundings and the mission of our scholars will bring these goals much closer to reality
5921151 based on the advice we have been receiving from several quarters we as members of the caribbean community are now in a better position to say let us slow down a minute and engage in a further review of the real value of the epa to the region
5921152 from this moment a decree of expropriation is in effect and the job stability of workers is guaranteed by the venezuelan state
5921153 according to a press release issued by petroleos de venezuela s a pdvsa pdvsa will proceed to take operational control of the plants of cemex venezuela
5921154 quite ready to make its operations transparent to talk about the nationalization
5921155 the one thing is we have to be vigilant that this process is fair just and reaches a solution favorable for both sides
5921156 determined to safeguard the interests of holcim and its local employees in accordance with bilateral investment protection agreements in place between switzerland and venezuela
5921157 we are working as a team with the venezuelan government to follow the rising construction market in venezuela
5921158 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5921159 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer
5921160 at sidor production has fallen some 25 percent neither has there been progress in the belt
5921161 for the purpose of further developing the existing friendly and co operative relations between china and jamaica the chinese government has in the past provided scholarships to jamaica enabling a total of 12 students to pursue their studies in china
5921162 china is an ancient country with more than 5 000 years of history and is also a young country pursuing modernization and striving for building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects
5921163 if russia can do it then i should be allowed to do it also
5921164 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5921165 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5921166 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 dollars because the costs have increased
5921167 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5921168 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5921169 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5921170 we anticipate in the not too distant future we will be able to solve some of those cases
5921171 we are all aware of the negative impact the deportation situation is having on the region the hope is that there could be a change in policy directive on this issue
5921172 the us must recognise that a lot of these people who are being returned to the caribbean under the circumstances would have lived most of their lives in the us
5921173 what will he do here at the olympics i predict 19 5
5921174 he wont run faster than my world record here beijing but eventually he will because he has the talent to do it
5921175 what we saw in the 100m was technique and speed which he has and he has the best of any sprinter weve ever seen because of his stride length and efficiency put together
5921176 but stride length and efficiency wont get you the world record in the 200m you need another component that you have to bring into the equation and that is endurance
5921177 the 200m is very long sprint and so bolt has to be able to sustain the efficiency and the speed and technique that we saw in the 100m
5921178 for him to break the record he will have to be able to sustain that speed and technique in the 200m for 19seconds and thats very very difficult to do its not impossible for him to do
5921179 look hes going to do it hes going to break the 200m world record theres no doubt about it
5921180 during the campaign of 2006 we sought of introduced drag racing as a sport to the general public
5921181 drag racing is an effort to take racing off the road and to give an avenue for youngsters to develop themselves and to practice racing as a sport in getting the facility now at new river it is an opportunity for this to be a reality
5921182 we have contacted our neighbours antigua st croix and as recent as yesterday sunday we had a visitor from st maarten a member of the association there to guide us in terms of the implications and the necessary infrastructure and improvements that we would want
5921183 i must say that it is an honour to come down here and see the kind of works that you guys are doing
5921184 i appreciate you taking your time out to invite us along to help and i would liaise with all other guys that i could get involved in all the other islands because we are going to do a big thing here
5921185 so it is good when you see the government step forward and do something
5921186 a lot of other places i think they are going to follow the example that nevis has set because it is all about we trying to get a circuit through the caribbean if we have a circuit in the caribbean we can race up down side ways here today this month we in nevis three months down the road we in trinidad so you always have races going on and keep the fuel going for the interest to be there i hope that you nevis are all ready for whats coming because its going to be a tidal wave
5921187 it is actually safer to race on the track than to drive on the street there are a lot of rules and restrictions in place for safety features so even though people look at it as a dangerous sport actually it is a lot safer than a lot of things that we do day to day because of the restrictions and the rules that are in place and its a place for venting you know get out some of that frustration out of the regular work week anyway
5921188 as it is they who can only get from the project that which they put into it
5921189 we expect that government organisations civil society national human rights institutions and the media will be stronger because of participating in this project
5921190 the human rights commission is now in full swing and now our ultimate goal is to promote and protect human rights in this country
5921191 fundamental rights and freedoms is apart of our amended constitution in 2006
5921192 is actually in the front part of the new constitution
5921193 to uphold human rights is not only a personal matter but it is a moral imperative of which the government has shown its commitment to it and we the people of this country has also taken and interest in promoting and protecting human rights
5921194 in order to be a first world country and or to play on the international arena
5921195 as a government we believe in human rights and we believe in the fundamental rights and freedom and of course the six core international conventions that our country signed on to
5921196 human rights is important to the development of an individual human rights is important to the maturity your country
5921197 whether you will grow and mature to the aspect that any country aspire to or whether you would be like the countries we do not want to associate with when it comes to peoples human rights we want to ensure tha all people in the turks and caicos rights are protected
5921198 as emotional as it is the government needs to be reasonable rational in the position it adopts the governments position is the death penalty is the law we will enforce it in accordance with the law
5921199 it does not affect the death penalty imposed from july 8 2004
5921200 the state is quite mindful of the time that is running with respect to those persons and we are doing our best through our attorneys in england to try and have those matters listed in short order
5921201 a lot of officers in the system are not working but we are looking at sanctions to address the problem
5921202 building managerial capacity and accountability in the reformed education sector
5921203 dealing with pesticides can be potentially harmful if workers dont have the proper equipment and arent informed of the best ways to handle and dispose of them
5921204 epa wants to stress that worker protection should be the utmost priority for farm owners and these recent settlements underscore this point
5921205 time reversal for spatial focusing and temporal compression of acoustic waves in enclosures
5921206 our phone calls to management were unanswered and never returned prior to yesterday saturday
5921207 we hold freedom of speech to be among the most important basic human rights
5921208 we believe these principles ought to be enshrined in our constitution and recognized by all bodies including corporate entities
5921209 we take exception to the fact that a company whose shareholders are american a country that prides itself on being the beacon of freedom and democracy would allow itself to be a willing accomplice in censorship and restriction of information to the public
5921210 we believe that wiv is again allowing itself to be intimidated by the government who is running a self preservation campaign to stop people from cooperating with the commission of inquiry

5921220 as a result they decided that steven parrish had to go
5921221 there was no date or time discussed for the killing but it was made very clear to all those present that parrish was going to be killed
5921222 it looks like other people are trying to make a scapegoat out of this defendant

5921229 herankah kalian dengan cemburunya saad itu ketahuilah bahwa saya lebih cemburu dari padanya demi allah saya cemburu karena kecemburuan allah terhadap perbuatan keji baik secara terang terangan maupun sembunyi sembunyi
5921230 sesungguhnya allah itu pencemburu dan orang mukmin juga pencemburu kecemburuan allah itu adalah apabila seorang mukmin melakukan apa yang allah haramkan atasnya
5921231 tiga golongan yang tidak bakal masuk surga orang yang durhaka terhadap bapak ibunya duyuts orang yang tidak mempunyai rasa cemburu dan perempuan yang menyerupai laki laki

5921245 abuses are often based on ignorance in that they involve a rejection of those elements whose deeper meaning are not understood
5921246 celebrating community does not have to re invent the sacred rites in every age
5921247 not infrequently abuses are rooted in a false sense of liberty yet god has not granted us a liberty by which we may do what we wish but a liberty by which we may do what is fitting and right
5921248 to ignore the norms of the mass is to sow seeds of discord and division
5921249 it is to be remembered that the eucharistic sacrifice and indeed the sacred liturgy as a whole are not something that we make or invent or put together on our own
5921250 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick
5921251 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
5921252 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
5921253 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
5921254 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

5921315 people who have been part of a war that i consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it
5921316 they command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of whats actually happening on the ground generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than congress members who are against the war
5921317 when youre coming out of the military the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit
5921318 youve got family youve got friends but you dont have the people who have been there and thats a huge thing in this community we have that whether they want to live here or they want to stay a weekend or they just want to come over and watch some tv for a little while its just a space for veterans
5921319 our military is trained to kill people and were the bullies
5921320 i didnt sign up in the military to be a bully i signed up to protect people from bullies we started to talk about iraq and iraq just didnt pass the smell test

5921326 if i have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides hes not going to join the military thats a direct action
5921327 a war resister inside the military is both but that doesnt necessarily make it more effective i would rather have 1 000 high school students who would otherwise not join than one person within the military resist thats taking 1 000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out

5921355 despite their ineptitude in a lot of other areas and how poor they are at governing one of the things the bush administration has been very good at is using administrative mechanisms to control policy outcomes
5921356 i have worked on regulatory issues inside the beltway since 1976 and have watched five presidents come and go
5921357 the bush administration is the most hostile and aggressive toward these agencies by a couple of orders of magnitude making the reagan era look relatively benign
5921358 no matter who is elected in november it will take years to repair this damage
5921359 politics is injected and elevated into decisions where science and rational judgment should prevail
5921360 politics supersedes scientific and technical information that is critical to protecting our environment and health and safety at home and in the workplace
5921361 many of the politicization scandals in this administration came from cases where unqualified or inexperienced people got into key jobs often with the power to hire others or control information flows
5921362 despite the presidents promise to bring business like thinking to the federal government the bush administration has overseen or at least permitted a significant expansion of both the height and width of the federal hierarchy
5921363 there have never been more layers at the top of government nor more occupants at each layer
5921364 weve been particularly concerned that some of the scientific community is being co opted by political manipulation and that policy is being presented as fact
5921365 the power to coordinate information collection and to review proposed final regulations in a policy office of the white house made omb the equivalent of a political censor over agency actions
5921366 protect his right to select appointees based not only on their managerial prowess but also on their commitment to his policy agenda and their ability to advance articulate and defend it
5921367 one of the things this administration is going to be most known for is that they provided a lot of special access for business interests
5921368 theyve allowed an unprecedented level of involvement by private interests in creating political policy with regard to regulation with regard to rules their energy policy their greenhouse gas policy all of that
5921369 not since oira was created has there been a less appropriate nominee
5921370 dudleys work shows that she is not so much prejudiced against regulation as wary of it
5921371 dudley will bring to the job a wariness of new rules and an expertise in analyzing rules likely effects both of which are appropriate even essential
5921372 a string of meltdowns that will make the federal response to hurricane katrina look like a minor mistake
5921373 i would promote more career professionals into key positions not enough use is being made of civil servants
5921374 the civil service was created to provide expert and continuous management of government the increase in appointees has hurt both the cultivation of expertise and the continuity of management
5921375 we dont need ideological stowaways undermining the work of the next administration
5921376 the history of these issues demonstrates that at some point the pendulum reaches a limit in its rightward swing
5921377 i think that point passed about two years ago and that it has already begun to swing back how long it will take to traverse the arc is the real question
5921378 it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure
5921379 leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia moore had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program moore was 46
5921380 stupid grin on your face singing as loud as you can playing some type of air instrument and looking ridiculous but you just dont give a shit
5921381 we paint our sins on the ceiling i keep them glued to my chest it keeps me close like a promise kept
5921382 so you cant hold a star in your hand though at least you can move on to that better plan rusted wheel planted still rusted wheel cant move on
5921383 if i were a king if i had everything if i had you and i could give you your dreams if i were giant sized on top of it all then tell me what in the world would i sing for if i had it all sometimes i feel lost as i pull you out like strings of memories wish i could weave them into you then i could figure the whole damn puzzle out then again oh
5921384 i was a victim in the past but if i remain one i am now a volunteer
5921385 god here are the symptoms i see in my life name the problems will you give me the courage to face the causes behind them and lead me to the help i need to resolve them
5921386 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
5921387 but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint
5921388 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
5921389 therefore strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees make level paths for your feet so that the lame may not be disabled but rather healed

5921392 oh thats nothing you think you have problems i know what its like my cheating husband and my bank account blah blah blah its hard and it sucks because i have those problems too
5921393 wow i am so sorry you are having such a hard time right now i cant even imagine how you feel you must be mentally exhausted but you are strong you can do it i remember how i felt when my husband cheated on me it sucks but i cant even imagine how you feel
5921394 my husband is in the hospital after having a heart attack and im trying to hold down the fort at home
5921395 oh i know i remember when i had my heart attack i was in the hospital for 2 weeks and they wouldnt let me out and then they want to do another stress test and then called in the specialist blah blah blah
5921396 jazz is probably my main influence but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5921397 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5921398 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
5921399 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
5921400 seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell
5921401 for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
5921402 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth
5921403 so far as we can tell from scripture the present hell is somewhere in the heart of the earth itself it is also called the pit isa 14 9 15 ezek 32 18 21 and the abyss rev 9 2 to say this is not scientific is to assume science knows much more about the earths interior than is actually the case the great pit hell would only need to be about 100 miles or less in diameter to contain with much room to spare all the forty billion or so people who have ever lived assuming their spiritual bodies are the same size as their physical bodies
5921404 the earths inner core has a temperature of over 12 000 degrees fahrenheit
5921405 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them
5921406 out of the bottomless abyss of heklafell or rather out of hell itself rise melancholy cries and loud wailings so that these can be heard for many miles around there may be heard in the mountain fearful howlings weeping and gnashing of teeth
5921407 the fearsome noises that issued from some of their volcanoes were certainly thought to be the screams of tormented souls in the fires of hell below
5921408 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
5921409 perhaps the strangest of ocean creatures recently discovered are riftia the giant tube worms measuring up to 8 feet in length the worms are only found near deep sea vents
5921410 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
5921411 look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed
5921412 looking upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed
5921413 needless to say we were shocked to make such a discovery but we know what we saw and we know what we heard and we are absolutely convinced that we drilled through the gates of hell
5921414 the drill suddenly began to rotate wildly indicating that we had reached a large empty pocket or cavern temperature sensors showed a dramatic increase in heat to 2 000 degrees fahrenheit
5921415 we lowered a microphone designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft but instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain at first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment
5921416 but when we made adjustments our worst suspicions were confirmed the screams werent those of a single human they were the screams of millions of humans
5921417 and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments
5921418 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
5921419 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
5921420 the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night
5921421 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
5921422 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgement
5921423 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
5921424 god is a god of love he wont allow this
5921425 he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
5921426 he is an holy god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins
5921427 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
5921428 im looking forward to dying and being cast into hell thats where i belong
5921429 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
5921430 the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night
5921431 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
5921432 boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth
5921433 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
5921434 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
5921435 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
5921436 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags
5921437 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us
5921438 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree
5921439 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
5921440 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
5921441 we had a similar deal with multimedia victoria in providing centralised access for government we started discussions with aisv in march 2007 with a concept that included videoconferencing but that ended up not being part of the initial project
5921442 we are very keen to work with aisv to promote this it is aisv that has the billing arrangement with the schools
5921443 we have done a lot of work with the nsw board of studies and they are looking at doing something for examination centres

5921447 different athletes are saying things and a lot of them we dont have relationships with
5921448 it is a strategic placement on mcdonalds part to offer it to the athletes at their doorstep and the spill off that comes is a bonus
5921449 what did i eat a better question might be what didnt i eat i had my usual big mac
5921450 looking at the games so far mcdonalds clearly has a product placement strategy
5921451 if you show an implied endorsement such as bolt talking about chicken mcnuggets thats golden
5921452 some people will tell you its worth millions of dollars
5921453 while not all cases require this level of expediency the bce appeal shows that our court system can respond to the needs of litigants for efficient resolution of disputes
5921454 the average appeal in the supreme court takes approximately 18 months from the filing of the leave application to the rendering of the decision on appeal in the case of the bce appeal this time was compressed to one month
5921455 i have never before seen the supreme court act with anything approaching the speed of the bce appeal
5921456 there is no question that all of the superior courts and courts of appeal are well aware that their reputation in the business world is not good in terms of speed
5921457 there is a reasonable basis for that concern because litigation does take years
5921458 the court has largely been on the periphery of bay streets radar but became its focus overnight with the bce case
5921459 in that context claims of unresponsiveness tend to be overblown
5921460 however while the complaint was overblown the courts docket has shifted to include more business disputes in areas such as corporate commercial law pensions tax class actions and intellectual property

5921468 the concern is basically for a loss of effect for drugs and particularly those used in serious medical conditions
5921469 these are three serious medical conditions for which the drugs simply have to work properly
5921470 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5921471 and we have only a very rudimentary understanding of what these pumps do and what drugs they affect and what other drugs or foods might modulate these pumps
5921472 theres a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the implications are for the average person
5921473 the best thing to do in general to get the most consistent effect of your drug is to take it with a glass of water on an empty stomach

5921480 wouldnt it be nice to take the rock out for a stroll
5921481 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5921482 these price levels are acceptable for jewellery makers and private investors buying on the etf from now on actual demand will recover
5921483 the market has also been oversold in the last few days so i guess theres a decent short covering i think 840 will be some sort of resistance
5921484 sentiment is bearish in platinum and i think physical buyers just wait and see with prices likely to move in a range of 1 350 to 1 400
5921485 sentiment has been hit since auto makers lowered their production forecast the market is also concerned about growing worries over the outlook of the global economy
5921486 people say rugby union players are not trustworthy with women but its the individual that has committed this crime against another person and this individual is responsible for his behaviour
5921487 a code of conduct is there is protect all players associated with the game but if someone commits a criminal assault than the game cant be held responsible
5921488 its very disappointing to see that people dont have the discipline to look after themself if you commit a crime you accept the consequences that follow
5921489 james morrison has a huge international following as a dynamic musician and composer and is also highly regarded as a great communicator and educator mr dunn said

5921493 right now i started to diet i live in the alkaline world now water greens i dont eat red meat and i only eat like half a cup of brown rice and i do a lot of exercise and biking every morning for two hours

5921508 there are two main types of bullying at the moment and they are through the internet and by children copying rage in their environments
5921509 children feel more powerful when they bully research shows bullies emerge not because they are insecure themselves but because they become popular in their groups at school
5921510 sometimes bullies may feel they are actually the ones getting picked on and they retaliate by bullying
5921511 parents need to be conscious and supervise their childs time on the computer and move the computer to a public space in the home
5921512 obesity is a problem at the moment we are making children too scared to go outside and play and not creating a healthy balance between stranger danger and outside play
5921513 everybody is talking about it and it is becoming a bit out of control not so much about eating but less exercise
5921514 parents think it is safer to keep their kids at home these days and therefore they are playing too many computer games and watching tv
5921515 it was fantastic glen mcgrath is such a genuine and nice fellow he greeted us all when we arrived at his property and had lunch with us im sure the donation meant a lot to him
5921516 a woman outside started shouting to lily and she just lashed out at her though she missed with her punch
5921517 not surprisingly the woman didnt seem that scared by lily and in fact she seemed more bemused by it all
5921518 of course wed gone looking for an ap story but failed to find one until friday night that is at 7 44 p m eastern time picklers colleague
5921519 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing
5921520 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5921521 i have complained that my joint secretary offerd me rs 30 000 to sleep in a hotel with him when i complained the secretary wrote on my complaint i dont wish to be disturbed on such issues
5921522 she has consumed poison but is now stable at present she is conscious and is out of danger
5921523 ever since the complaints enquiries have been instituted against me my phones are tapped and i have been going through this for one year
5921524 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people are seeing their incomes decline
5921525 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5921526 i will let no one question my love of this country
5921527 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5921528 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
5921529 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
5921530 i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5921531 the following documents provide a summary of public input gathered from february through april of 2008 this information is being analyzed and used as a reference as we conduct fieldwork and develop policies and programs for the draft plan additional comments and suggestions will be accepted throughout the process
5921532 if i run into him i get all fluttery and nervous
5921533 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5921534 reached as a result of extensive discussions with the plaintiffs lawyers
5921535 much work remains to be done to finalize the agreement and to appropriate the funds needed for the settlement
5921536 the settlement has not been finalized and the administration has yet to determine how best to appropriate the funds for the settlement
5921537 are documents of a nature exempted under the provisions of the access to public records act in that they are part of files maintained as part of the process of hiring judges
5921538 a similar argument was previously reviewed by the rhode island supreme court and rejected
5921539 governmental agency could label all of its records personnel records leaving nothing accessible to the public
5921540 the fact that the jnc may maintain the requested letters in personnel files or otherwise considers the requested letters part of a candidates personnel file holds little weight
5921541 all personal or medical information relating to an individual in any files
5921542 the jnc should focus on whether the requested letters contain personal or medical information rather than whether the requested letters contain information in personnel files maintained to hire evaluate promote or discipline any employee of a public body
5921543 it suffices to say however that this determination must be made on a letter by letter basis
5921544 it is conceivable that requested letters may contain personal or medical information and therefore be exempt
5921545 it is equally possible that exemptions not cited by the jnc in its advisory request may apply
5921546 may be exempt from disclosure if the privacy interests implicated by disclosure outweigh the public interest in disclosure
5921547 there can be little doubt that rhode islanders have a significant interest in ensuring that highly qualified individuals seeking lifetime judicial appointments are selected in as open and accessible a process as possible this advisory opinion is based upon the specific provision that the judicial nominating commission asked us to review and reflects the essence of the access to public records act in ensuring an open and honest government that also protects an individuals privacy interests
5921548 i agree with the attorney generals analysis generally that it would appear that all things being equal these letters should be available to the public
5921549 so im confident mr carlotti has always been acting in good faith and will continue to do so and that very soon these records will be turned over
5921550 keep in mind that people wrote the letters without the assurance that they were confidential but wanted their views to be known
5921551 they reflect i think a traditional bipartisan wisdom when it comes to foreign policy neither of them are ideologues but they try to get the facts right and make a determination about whats best for u s interests and theyre good guys

5921554 medigap policies help pay your share coinsurance copayments or deductibles of the costs of medicare covered services some medigap policies cover certain costs not covered by the original medicare plan
5921555 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5921556 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5921557 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
5921558 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
5921559 it is gratifying to see somebody from the trenches get the chance to be a judge

5921581 rasulullah saw mengambil sutera beliau letakkan di sebelah kanannya dan mengambil emas kemudian diletakkan di sebelah kirinya lantas beliau berkata kedua ini haram buat laki laki dari ummatku
5921582 aku pernah mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda jangan kamu memakai sutera karena barangsiapa memakai di dunia kelak di akhirat tidak lagi memakainya
5921583 sesungguhnya ini adalah pakaian orang yang nantinya di akhirat tidak ada sedikitpun bahagian baginya
5921584 salah seorang di antara kamu ini sengaja mengambil bara api kemudian beliau letakkan di tangannya setelah itu rasulullah pergi kepada si laki laki tersebut di katakan ambillah cincinmu itu dan manfaatkanlah maka jawabnya tidak demi allah saya tidak mengambil cincin yang telah dibuang oleh rasulullah

5921594 they have to be trained over a period of time and there are not shortcuts we are short of about 400 pilots but with the measures we are taking we will make good the shortage in the next five years

5921600 when considered in its proper context these results indicate that the problem of personal information disclosure on myspace may not be as widespread as many assume and that the overwhelming majority of adolescents are responsibly using the web site
5921601 i dont really get into that seems a bit strange
5921602 despite the present uncertainties in world financial markets a leading institution has made this significant line of credit available to quay given the current climate quay considers this to be an endorsement of our business
5921603 come now lets kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him then well see what comes of his dreams
5921604 dont shed any blood throw him into this cistern here in the desert but dont lay a hand on him
5921605 because akshay and i have worked together and given hits in the past he didnt quote his market price for singh is kinng
5921606 any producer will pay him rs 50 60 crore now
5921607 he is a very good looking hero who entered the industry as an action hero at a time when audiences really looked up to that genre
5921608 kumars is not a fresh face in the industry but with each film hes willing to experiment and thats what gives him the edge
5921609 hes an actor who was game to don a turban in his new film how many leading names in indian cinema can actually do that
5921610 he carried off a pink kurta in namaste london it wasnt easy but he did it hes extraordinarily professional and a no nonsense guy
5921611 kumar despite being a top rung actor in films has remained like hrithik roshan in the second rung as far as endorsements go says harish bijoor brand specialist amp ceo harish bijoor consultants adding

5921618 i am most worried when i dont see russians around
5921619 if you were not prepared for a war why start one
5921620 there is nothing left in some villages but earth and sky
5921621 the day begins with a morning meeting where material harvested from 15 tivos and even more newspapers magazines and web sites is reviewed
5921622 nope its literally 15 rack mounted tivos of various models many from the pre series 2 era some philips boxes some sonys and because theres a limited number of remote codes when a staffer operates one he has to hold the remote directly against that boxs ir receiver so that the beam doesnt hit any of the other boxes i e so hes not inadvertently controlling multiple boxes at once no joke its pretty primitive
5921623 when tivo footage is needed for the daily show that day i e every day the clips are dubbed off to beta tape and brought to an editing bay yup sneakernet sounds like a lot of work right it is i wouldnt be surprised if the show upgrades to a networked pvr system especially with an imminent move to hd but i dont know what their plans are
5921624 i was a researcher at the show for a couple years and still visit the office from time to time its fun to watch people speculate about the magical super high tech inner workings of the show truth is its less about technology or cutting edge production and more about the staff being really good at their jobs a good rule of thumb when theorizing about cable tv production is that everything is less expensive and less elaborate than you think it is
5921625 i suppose the system remains in place for now because its cheap it works and everyone knows how to use it the grind of putting out a quality show every day tends to push thoughts of sweeping equipment upgrades to the back burner
5921626 but you never know what will happen at a grand slam every player is good everyone wants to win i will be happy if i am in the second week or in the quarter finals or something for now i just have to enjoy this moment
5921627 when i played roger federer he was intimidating me a lot
5921628 rafa nadal too novak djokovic these players are one step up but now maybe i can do good matches against them or maybe other players will feel the same when i am playing with them because i am winning a lot of tournaments
5921629 i dont know if i play my game i have chances against every player
5921630 with my serve and my forehand it is better to play on hard courts
5921631 i like playing on clay because i started playing tennis on clay courts i know how to do it but if i want to be a good player i want to be able to play on a harder surface
5921632 if i could choose one grand slam title to win it would be the us open its on hard courts and i like new york manhattan i like the atmosphere
5921633 it is one of my dreams wimbledon has the history and i loved it this year but i just love the us open
5921634 well you know not all arab women compete in the veil syrias ghada shouaa wore a standard track and field uniform when she competed and won the gold medal in the heptapalon in 1996
5921635 se termin un ciclo de 25 a os de alimentos baratos

5921639 debe ser muy responsable y no permitir un colapso de los precios del crudo

5921646 la reactivaci n de las precipitaciones est resultando sumamente lenta por lo que una amplia extensi n del rea agr cola nacional sigue sin recibir alivio efectivo

5921648 con nuestro pedido de 500 millones de pesos queremos evitar que se profundice la recesi n en muchas ciudades y pueblos y que avance el desempleo en el sector rural

5921660 jazz is probably my main influence but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5921661 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5921662 all of us are just really sad and down about it
5921663 but if dave and the band decided to go on with the show that means they know it was the right thing to do and leroi would have wanted it
5921664 and you didnt take ap english with me and you should have

5921670 i got into this race to change the way business is done in washington i said early on that we are not going to take pac money and were not going to take money from federal lobbyists
5921671 i feel like ive been disenfranchised by the candidate and the democratic national committee
5921672 you know a lot of those lobbyists whether you like it or not represent real americans
5921673 when i go to the white house im going to be answerable to you im not going to be answerable to a lot of fat cat donors
5921674 the antidotes to fear and ignorance are desire and knowledge
5921675 singing sweet home alabama watching lon chaney doing the werewolves of london all summer long
5921676 i feel good i got a chance to run around at practice yesterday and throw the ball
5921677 i havent had any pain everything im doing they want me to do it pain free that was the case yesterday
5921678 the key thing is to have him as close to full speed as possible because even if he had not had a hamstring injury the chances of most of the guys being 100 percent for game day is remote there is always something nagging
5921679 well do the right things but well take it in that step by step day by day process
5921680 i just won a gold medal for the united states when you win a gold medal for your country youre like the statue of liberty
5921681 put yourself in my parents shoes or the shoes of anybody who has crossed over from mexico would you stay poor with no chance to improve yourself or find a way to go to the best country in the world any way you could
5921682 i guess that unless youre a native american somebody could say you dont really belong in the united states because almost everybody is from somewhere else but it causes arguments because almost everybody is a little bit racist
5921683 heres a wrestler who has a black eye and a gold medal but hes a mommas boy
5921684 id like to win a championship fulfill that the dream
5921685 my little man son trey is now 6 foot tall and 155 pounds
5921686 hes into football plays safety and running back he plays a little baseball too
5921687 right now my goal is to help the white sox win
5921688 and 1995 i had a lot of great teammates who are still friends
5921689 hes the best coach ive ever had and the roughest
5921690 he knows my swing my game my body weve got some work to do
5921691 i was just ecstatic going on off a walk off at the little league world series
5921692 but as far as getting kids into the pool youre looking at michael phelps
5921693 hopefully we dont have to turn too many kids away because they might decide to do soccer
5921694 last year due to a shortage of available pools we turned away over 50 swimmers because we had no additional room in our pool
5921695 the question is if were able to capitalize on a michael phelps phenomenon where are we going to put these people
5921696 women did not create the glass ceiling the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what theyre worth but they help maintain it
5921697 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
5921698 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts
5921699 i had just shot a pilot with cassidy freeman who plays tess mercer on smallville she ruined it
5921700 they didnt pick it up and i think it was a day or two later when i got the call and we talked a lot about it i love playing the character its a great show and a lot of fun for me so when they said series regular i was definitely interested im excited about it
5921701 i got a lot of faith in them in the writers
5921702 they always write good stuff for me i am just lucky because i get to be the face that benefits theyre the ones that do it though
5921703 i dont know shes really diving head first into the isis and shes really taking on the job of being the mentor and the kind of place of solace for all the meteor infected so i think that thats really going to see her be focused and shes pretty angry at lex luthor so shes going to stay as far away from him and his cohorts as possible
5921704 its time for him to grow up a little bit and not rely on chloe so much so that chloe can go off and forge her own path
5921705 shes been his shadow for a really long time and while she has been doing things of great importance i think its really exciting to see her start to see her kind of forge her own way and figure out what shes passionate about separate and aside from clark you really start to see her do that at the isis foundation and shes really narrowing down her scope of what she wants to focus on which is really to try and help that part of the population in the world and i think thats really cool
5921706 anstatt den ausgang der n chsten wahlen mit der aktuellen umfrage vorauszusagen wird der ausgang der aktuellen umfrage mit alten wahlergebnissen vorausgesagt
5921707 zwischen dem was wir an rohergebnissen erhalten und dem was wir als prognose publizieren liegt manchmal eine differenz von zehn oder elf prozent
5921708 die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen insgesamt gehen sie von einer zwar schw cheren aber alles in allem robusten konjunkturentwicklung aus und bef rchten naheliegenderweise keine rezession
5921709 largely duplicates the watch list matching that is conducted on all travelers every time they fly
5921710 i think in todays day and age student loans are very important there arent too many jobs out here that cover a full students expense for a college education so student loans bridge the gap
5921711 the cost of the loans was running me about 550 a month but by not being able to consolidate would have move the cost of the loan up to almost 1 100 to 1 200 for our budget it really just would have blown things out of kilter with us

5921713 lets face it this is about the only way people are gonna believe im a lincoln republican
5921714 was the strength of the younger groups spirituality wed got the impression from previous research and from some interviews that quite a few pilgrims especially the younger ones were not much involved with their local church however that seemed to be the case with only about a quarter of the younger group nearly half of them were regular church attenders had a strong faith and a firm sense of catholic identity they were a lot more involved in the life of faith than was typical for catholics their age what the survey told us was that underneath the youthful exuberance most of them had a core of solid commitment
5921715 i can replace this good card with this slightly worse inexpensive card
5921716 why are you telling me to netdeck jake the only reason im reading building on a budget is so i can make an affordable deck
5921717 loyal kin elders siblings i cannot welcome you with a wish of peace today
5921718 as many of you know during last nights wildfeast the goblin tribes staged a cowardly attack on our heartwood groves
5921719 i know many of you have deep roots in the groves affected and i know that your hearts ache with injustice even hours after the attack you feel that we have not acted with sufficient speed or vigor you long for a chance to repay our grave debt to the goblins in battle
5921720 the team has worked hard to be ready for the race at valencia the first of the last part of the season
5921721 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point wil have a great value the less there are the more important they become
5921722 i know valencia because weve done several tests here last winter but now were racing in the city on a new track im sure it will be a great atmosphere
5921723 ive seen the new track only from the position of an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit i always love to drive on new tracks and i am always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
5921724 again this season shows that you should never give up
5921725 there were some races where things didnt go well but for one reason or the other i was able to collect some precious points my position after hungary is better than before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently i think that the outcome of the championship will be very tight with ferrari and mclaren very close together in terms of performance and three drivers in a position to win the title i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race of the season this is the sole aim the rest is details
5921726 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5921727 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5921728 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5921729 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5921730 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5921731 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5921732 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5921733 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5921734 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5921735 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5921736 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5921737 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5921738 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5921739 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5921740 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5921741 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5921742 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5921743 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5921744 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5921745 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5921746 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5921747 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5921748 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5921749 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5921750 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5921751 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5921752 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5921753 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5921754 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5921755 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5921756 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5921757 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5921758 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5921759 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5921760 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5921761 between 30 and 40 positive tests in the 15 days of action to come and acknowledged the bleak reality that drugs in sport like criminality in society is here to stay
5921762 ive not expected that many cases to occur during the olympic games we usually have 12 cases or so but this time many federations have conducted intensive out of competition testing before the games and we have seen the consequences of that
5921763 and it shows that hopefully the athletes here competing are clean
5921764 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation how to prove this is scientifically very difficult
5921765 there are ways but it is not a scientifically or legally accurate way of doing it it can be plus or minus two years and can be manipulated using certain substances
5921766 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5921767 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5921768 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5921769 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5921770 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5921771 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5921772 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5921773 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5921774 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5921775 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5921776 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5921777 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5921778 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5921779 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5921780 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5921781 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5921782 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5921783 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5921784 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5921785 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5921786 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5921787 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5921788 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5921789 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5921790 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5921791 i saw him ramzi coming in front of me and i had a plan of maybe kicking outsprinting him in the last 200 metres
5921792 the gold medal is a great honour to bahrain and the arabic world
5921793 it is not easy for an arab to win a gold medal its hard to come by
5921794 i was crying because of everything so many people sacrificed a lot for me my brother came and coached me for a whole year and my wife didnt work in a year to support me it was the first year of our marriage i just saved my energy for the last lap
5921795 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5921796 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5921797 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5921798 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5921799 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5921800 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5921801 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5921802 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5921803 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5921804 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5921805 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5921806 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5921807 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5921808 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5921809 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5921810 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5921811 the appointment of tony howarth as deputy chairman will capitalise on mr howarths experience as chairman of the former home building society in west australia and reflects the banks continued focus on the growing west australian economy
5921812 tony love has done a great job as deputy chairman but has decided to step down from this position and enable tony howarth to take the reigns and drive the banks focus on the growing wa market
5921813 although many australians dream of living on the coast or in the country in reality the best quality of life in australia is found in the suburbs
5921814 in the suburbs residents often have the best of all worlds with access to good schools modern hospitals and reliable jobs but also large houses fast internet connections and low crime rates
5921815 despite the challenging equity market conditions plan b achieved a positive net new inflow of funds to its platforms during each quarter of the 2008 financial year
5921816 furthermore client withdrawals remained at similar levels to the prior year showing the benefits of a properly educated and disciplined client base
5921817 the buoyant western australian economy that assists greatly with the success of our organic growth initiatives such as the executive advisory service also brings cost pressures which have reflected in plan bs employee and property costs lines
5921818 unfortunately no one can predict the course of the worlds investment markets in the short term however we are confident that the benefits of soundly diversified portfolios together with the investments we are making in operating systems and future growth initiatives will ensure we remain on track to achieve our long term growth objectives these position the company well for when equity markets improve

5921844 earlier this month edwards still hoped to appear behind the scenes at the convention to help
5921845 a while back may senator edwards was invited to participate in our service project in denver we still havent heard back from him
5921846 what edwards really wants to do right now is concentrate on his family
5921847 a source close to edwards tells the sleuth that rather than go to denver to help bono end poverty
5921848 at one time clowns and mimes were like brothers in the form of court jesters and buffoons around 1850 the clowns found their home in the circus the mime arrived at the theatre clowns try to make us laugh but the mime actor explores the full range of emotions through dramatic portrayal of characters in many different situations

5921872 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5921873 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5921874 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5921875 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5921876 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5921877 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5921878 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations

5921914 so probably if you laid out a feminist agenda i would probably agree with a large portion of it i wouldnt identify as a feminist just like i probably wouldnt identify as a liberal or a progressive
5921915 i told them hasbro that i would literally commit suicide if they made an action figure of me i will kill myself
5921916 nunca esperava um jogo f cil contra ricardo e emanuel s o dois grandes jogadores tenho um grande respeito por eles eles s o grandes dolos para mim tenho muita honra de fazer a final representando o nosso pa s passando por eles

5921920 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
5921921 unfortunately or fortunately i havent had rat yet but my mother has and she says it is very nice
5921922 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5921923 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5921924 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5921925 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5921926 we feel deep gratitude to the local villagers and authorities that assisted us
5921927 some us universities have courses in mobile marketing right now mobile is at a point where online was 10 years ago
5921928 big 3 consoles will the 2d style graphics hold up

5921934 currently the xbox 360 is sold out and retailers are unable to restock their supply
5921935 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation from the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to the supreme court of the united states setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5921936 a smart enough jurist or legal thinker and that obama disagrees with thomass
5921937 the mayor is a team player and will do whatever is necessary to bring home a win in november
5921938 hes the mayor of los angeles i would think they would give him some more attention
5921939 deep concern at attempts to identify islam with terrorism violence and human rights violations
5921940 to take all possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and their value systems and to complement legal systems with intellectual and moral strategies to combat religious hatred and intolerance
5921941 a new beginning for the promotion and protection of human rights
5921942 to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person in the equal rights of men and women
5921943 we have reached a point at which the commissions declining credibility has cast a shadow on the reputation of the united nations system as a whole and where piecemeal reforms will not be enough
5921944 we did not have sufficient confidence in this text to be able to say that the
5921945 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
5921946 make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
5921947 its a classic case of rage of hate for someone its very personal
5921948 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance
5921949 took him into her office then to my amazement i heard her tell him that another way doesnt provide services or assistance for men my heart went out to this man because it was evident that he was truly a victim of domestic violence
5921950 this is discrimination and violating mens rights there are men with children that are being victimized it takes courage for men to come forward and admit they are victims then when they do we revictimize them all over again
5921951 we have limited resources and its all we can do to try and keep up with the demand for services for women and children
5921952 in all of that time there was one woman admitted who i was sure had been severely physically abused the rest of the women and kids who came and went were playing the system to the hilt
5921953 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5921954 perhaps in recognition of the many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting as well as its interpretation of the india safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency and other issues
5921955 also with respect to the safeguards agreement approved by the iaea on august 1 does india formally recognise that it may not unilaterally terminate the agreement or withdraw facilities or materials from safeguards even if fuel supplies are interrupted due to new delhi
5921956 has india initiated formal negotiations with the iaea regarding an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement or not

5921958 everyone thought he was going to be chilubas puppet but he showed very quickly that he took orders from no one
5921959 after long debate we decided that those oil contracts should be reconsidered not to be accepted just like that because things have changed the price of oil has changed the regime is new
5921960 we arrived at this consensus that those oil contracts should be reviewed
5921961 concerning the russian contract the former regime had signed it for political reasons and canceled it for political reasons too
5921962 this oil field will be put up for transparent public competition
5921963 some of the companies have said one year is hardly worth the investment
5921964 it appears that in present form they probably wont proceed on most of these or all
5921965 militias diverting the operation to carry out a political agenda
5921966 one of the special forces members said someone is moving and he is near the governors office
5921967 then an officer in the special forces shot him immediately killing him
5921968 they claimed that they were assigned by higher parties that represent the prime minister
5921969 if the government fails to comply with our demands we will take further actions
5921970 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5921971 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
5921972 there is the perception perpetuated in large part by hollywood that you can wait until your late 30s or even your early 40s and have a baby without too much trouble
5921973 its really difficult for a woman over 40 to conceive
5921974 women feel cultural pressure to get all of their schooling done and much of their career building done before they even start to think about marriage
5921975 my advice is to make getting married and having babies at least as much of a priority as your education goals and career goals
5921976 so much of our culture has made kids seem like big sacrifices and a big inconvenience
5921977 there is something to being an increasingly secular society and being a little self absorbed in not thinking about the legacy you want to leave
5921978 man kann nur besser werden wenn man gegen st rlere gegner spielt
5921979 wir sind seit zwei wochen am eis das ist eine gute vorbereitung gewesen und eine gro e herausforderung wir werden sehen wo wir stehen meiner meinung nach kann man nur besser werden wenn man gegen st rkere mannschaften spielt
5921980 ich bin nach salzburg gekommen damit ich mich sportlich weiterentwickle und salzburg hat daf r nat rlich gute voraussetzungen die ziele sind hochgesteckt aber das ist f r uns sportler motivierend wenn man spiele und titel gewinnt und nicht nur sagt man will vorne mitspielen sondern man will nat rlich meister werden
5921981 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
5921982 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
5921983 other information that shows a pervasive pattern of spiritual marriages between older men and girls 17 and younger

5921990 its in australias national interest for us to help build long term political and economic stability in this neighbourhood
5921991 the time for action concrete action on climate change is now
5921992 to be on the lookout for stock piles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent protestors at the up coming democratic national convention
5921993 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
5921994 be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location this could indicate the stock piling of supplies to be used against first responders
5921995 can also be used to throw at first responders and interfere with and horses
5921996 violent protestors are using 1 1 2 inch to 2 inch self tapping screws to secure the handles on these shields
5921997 the screws have been secured to the shields to act as an assault weapon against the officers
5921998 another tactic used by violent protestors is to sharpen the upper edges of the shields and then use them as a slashing weapon against the officers
5921999 heavy wooden handles in 5 foot lengths are perfect for swinging at first responders
5922000 metal posts can also be used to hold improvised tiki torches to deliver flammable liquid on first responders
5922001 can be used in balloons to throw shoot at first responders
5922002 artificial nails and polishes can harbor a lot of bacteria
5922003 prevent needle sticks the greatest danger to a tattooer is the possibility of transmission of hepatitis from a needle stick
5922004 to be aware of your surroundings and to be aware of the fact that diseases can be transmitted
5922005 wash your hands were going to say this over and over again today to the point youre going to be sick of hearing me say it
5922006 the doh guy went in there and really scrubbed didnt he
5922007 it takes just a minute amount of blood to transmit hepatitis
5922008 this is being done in the house where the next morning kids sit and eat breakfast at this table now the client the night before were they hepatitis positive where they hiv positive did they have tb
5922009 thanks to the t v shows everybody think theyre a tattoo artist yeah but if we cant eliminate them then we need to educate them
5922010 it can lead to some major surgery in order to fix the damage caused by a mrsa infection some people lose limbs over it and some people they lose their life over it
5922011 we all grow from it and theres more precautions and theres more health and concern for people
5922012 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
5922013 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
5922014 ooh a sheltered and judgmental tone thats exactly what i want to convey perfect
5922015 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5922016 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5922017 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5922018 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5922019 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5922020 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5922021 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5922022 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5922023 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5922024 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5922025 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5922026 berkurangnya kepemilikan saham ini bukan berarti kepemilikan berubah bakrie amp brothers masih memiliki lebh dari 35 saham bumi
5922027 tetap 35 yang berpindah hanya kustodiannya bank danamon hanya bertindak sebagai kustodian dari lender kreditor
5922028 pertumbuhan industri kita bersaing dengan pertumbuhan kebutuhan pangan ini yang membuat inflasi tinggi sekali vietnam mencatat inflasi diatas 20 inflasi zimbabwe mencapai ratusan ribu kali
5922029 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5922030 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5922031 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5922032 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5922033 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5922034 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5922035 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5922036 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5922037 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5922038 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5922039 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5922040 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5922041 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5922042 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5922043 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5922044 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5922045 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5922046 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5922047 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5922048 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5922049 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5922050 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5922051 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5922052 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5922053 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5922054 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5922055 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5922056 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5922057 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5922058 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5922059 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5922060 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5922061 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5922062 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5922063 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5922064 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5922065 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5922066 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5922067 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5922068 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5922069 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5922070 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5922071 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5922072 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5922073 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5922074 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5922075 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5922076 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5922077 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5922078 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5922079 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5922080 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5922081 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5922082 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5922083 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5922084 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5922085 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5922086 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5922087 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5922088 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5922089 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5922090 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5922091 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5922092 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5922093 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5922094 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5922095 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto

5922098 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5922104 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5922105 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5922106 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5922107 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5922108 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5922109 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5922110 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5922111 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5922112 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5922113 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5922114 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5922115 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5922116 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5922117 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5922118 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5922119 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5922120 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5922153 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5922154 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5922159 it gives the students a chance to see the real world outside of the classroom
5922160 its like the university was just waiting for someone to come along with this idea
5922161 they are always talking about developing a more intellectual climate and thats what this does
5922162 it was funny at first because youre seeing all of these faces youre used to seeing at 8 a m when nobody is awake
5922163 it was awkward at first but we found enough to keep the conversation going
5922164 it makes it seem like you have some sort of connection to this person thats teaching you
5922165 instead of just seeing this giant brain at the front you see a little more of a person
5922166 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit
5922167 i dont recall anything as big since the decade of the civil war
5922168 for extremists to target police is like hitting a symbol of repression it can help them rally a segment of the population

5922174 the balance of the lineup for the 33rd toronto international film festival set for september 4 13 2008 in canada has been announced a total of 249 feature films are on tap for the event 76 of which are either world international or north american premieres 61 films mark a filmmakers feature directing debut a total of 312 films from 64 countries will screen at this years festival compared to last years 349 films from 55 countries indiewire also posted an interview with tiff co director cameron bailey in a separate article
5922175 this month we asked critic robin wood whose books include hitchcocks films and hollywood from vietnam to reagan and who recently wrote essays for the criterion releases the furies and le plaisir to pick his ten favorite films released by criterion newly retired from teaching wood told us he intends to spend the remainder of his life enjoying himself with movies operas and concerts on dvd while writing books and articles on michael haneke tsai ming liang satyajit ray and others and spending a happy old age with his partner richard lippe and their cats
5922176 the first thing they would do in a manny farber school of film criticism is shut down one thing he said to me early on which seemed to have really informed a lot of his thinking because he was first and foremost a painter and he was a great admirer of jackson pollock he said the insight of seeing jackson pollocks work is the insight of seeing something designed on the vertical presented on the horizontal before pollock painting was seen horizontally and made horizontally and i think he liked that idea that you would do something vertically and view it horizontally my point being that that kind of perception difference to try to see things in a different way at a different angle that was underneath everything he wrote about films he was not in the great american critical mainstream his job was to take that odd approach find that unexpected insight he couldnt imagine himself writing the way a professional film critic does like david denby works manny simply couldnt do that
5922177 sure enough a moviefone search reveals that the film is currently playing a publicity free two matinees per day run at the creative entertainment coliseum quad on 181 street the same theater where roman polanski wanted and desired had its qualifying run last spring so far theres been no surreptitious manohla dargis review of religulous so if you find yourself in claremont or in the noseblood section of manhattan and decide to check it out by all means report back
5922178 we thought it was the answer to a mystery thats been going on for too long
5922179 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5922180 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off
5922181 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell i live for them i have to keep working to support my family its not an option to stop i have to pay the bills at the end of the day
5922182 the problems with educational underachievement are concentrated in the poorest areas of the country it is in those areas that our policies for a swedish model of school reform to create thousands more good new school places can make the most difference only then will children from disadvantaged families start to get the same kind of opportunity as others
5922183 record investment and schools hard work have transformed the lives and prospects of millions of young people since 1997 the number of schools where less than 25 of pupils gain five good gcses has dropped from 616 to 17 a 36 fold reduction
5922184 and standards are also rising in higher attaining schools the number of secondary schools where 70 or more pupils gain five good gcses has risen eleven fold to 891 up from 83 in 1997 we are now putting 400 million of extra money into schools with the lowest gcse results
5922185 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5922186 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5922187 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5922188 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5922189 it will be interesting to see if the obama campaign chooses to campaign heavily in arizona
5922190 the british policy is founded on very clear foundations that the rule of force does not replace the rule of law and the territorial integrity of sovereign nations is to be respected
5922191 on several counts russian behaviour over the last 10 days has violated those principles
5922192 it was striking to hear all nato members talking about the need to ensure that aggression does not pay
5922193 i think weve all been joyously watching the olympics to win at cycling sailing and now on the track and yet another set of great gold medals
5922194 it is a huge tribute to the olympic team i look forward to congratulating them in person
5922195 it bodes so well for 2012 and i think the whole nation is totally delighted and really proud at everything thats been achieved

5922200 and my brothers guts were hanging out and we couldnt save him so he had to shoot him
5922201 then jet took him down and said wake up wake up wake up
5922202 he wanted us to call him daddy and if we tried to run away he would shoot us
5922203 he was trying to find a camp with a lot of trees so no one would hear us scream or anything
5922204 he tried to kill me like 50 times before that and he couldnt do it
5922205 he tried to kill us with a whole bunch of other weapons his knife his ax and his hammer
5922206 i wish that you had a picture of his back because jet duncan totally trashed his back with sticks
5922207 he told me to get on the ground and he put a really thin rope around my neck and tried to kill me well he was making a movie of it
5922208 the only thing that i said is i said please dont and then i said his name
5922209 every time he said he was going to kill me dylan would start screaming and crying but i would only cry
5922210 he felt that he had to or the government was going to kill him the secret government
5922211 if you guys got a hold of it you would probably be crying really hard it was just a terrible movie
5922212 he duncan was saying oh my god oh my god he was crying and screaming about it
5922213 well we were going to watch the movie star wars revenge of the sith because he wanted to see a movie before he went to prison

5922220 i wish i had woken up but i know he was here
5922221 he has always wanted to give back and make people happy and make them give them a little piece of him a piece of his heart because he has a great heart
5922222 it takes courage to embrace a family in that position he did it
5922223 it wasnt to better his image in the community or in the world
5922224 just clutched the balloons smiled and went back to sleep
5922225 stevie came over and said wow you came and at a full run he leaped into michaels arms
5922226 we have a disaster here he wants to see michael
5922227 it was so touching so touching to see this big guy touched by the frailty of life that stevie wanted him
5922228 i said id try to get a medal and hopefully itd be a gold one
5922229 death as we know it is not an easy thing to take as an adult let alone a child
5922230 stevie it was great to see you last night im really glad i got to visit you are very brave you really are an inspiration to us all talk to you soon michael
5922231 it never went out in the press that he was here never
5922232 no one ever knew the depth of the relationship between them
5922233 when he passed away when we went to the funeral it was hard it was an honor for me to have someone like him look up to me
5922234 im sure hes looking down on us and im sure hes cheering from above
5922235 he dont like liberals and he dont pull no punches

5922239 been advocating for clear specific definitions to avoid misleading green claims
5922240 the ftcs definition of carbon offsets could most affect the retailers ultra ambitious goal to someday run on 100 percent renewable energy a huge amount of which would likely have to come from offsets or renewable energy certificates

5922245 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
5922246 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
5922247 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
5922248 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

5922258 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5922259 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5922260 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5922261 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5922262 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5922263 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5922264 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5922265 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5922266 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5922267 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5922268 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5922269 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5922270 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5922271 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5922272 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5922273 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5922274 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5922275 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5922276 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5922277 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5922278 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5922279 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5922280 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5922281 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5922282 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5922283 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5922284 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5922285 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5922286 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5922287 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5922288 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5922289 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5922290 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5922291 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5922292 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5922293 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5922295 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5922296 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5922297 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5922298 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5922302 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5922303 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5922304 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5922305 it s time to pay some attention to your home look around to see what changes can be made to brighten your surroundings be creative instead of just spending money you may find some easy ways to improve your living space and make it more comfortable for you and your guests giving your space a fresh new look may make you feel a bit refreshed and renewed inside
5922306 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5922307 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5922308 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5922309 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5922310 this is a planning took where all things are going
5922311 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5922312 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5922313 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5922314 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5922315 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5922316 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5922317 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5922318 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5922319 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5922320 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5922321 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5922322 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5922323 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5922324 for 10 years we became accustomed to the canadian dollar at 75 to 80 cents which fundamentally meant for an american coming up here you come up for two days and the third day is free
5922325 you put all of those together and the numbers from the u s are down theres no doubt about that at all
5922326 when consumer confidence is shaken discretionary expenditures like travel are affected
5922327 that same day visitor from the united states has just been disappearing there has been some effort to shift marketing in the u s to a longer haul visitor
5922328 i encourage hoteliers all the time to look at your market and then make sure that you devote your resources very very carefully to that
5922329 a lot of the international visitors that have come to canada those travel decisions were made six eight ten months ago
5922330 although we may see gas prices impacting some short term decision making we really havent started to feel the effects of it
5922331 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5922332 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5922333 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5922334 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5922335 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5922336 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5922337 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5922338 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5922339 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5922340 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5922341 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5922342 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5922343 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5922344 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5922345 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5922346 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5922347 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5922348 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5922349 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5922350 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5922351 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5922352 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5922353 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5922354 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5922355 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5922356 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5922357 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5922358 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5922359 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5922360 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5922361 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5922362 how in the heck does he walk with this thing or how does this thing sit in his pants
5922363 passing the legislation into law would help the authorities get rid of the large number of foreign beggars in the country
5922364 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5922365 the incubator for new transformational concepts to build the military of the 21st century

5922367 ongoing diplomatic negotiations between the rok and north korea show the potential for a peaceful reconciliation and eventual reunification of the two nations while a unified korea is not a certainty a political settlement on unification may be reached by 2015
5922368 this is probably one of the best teams im not talking about talent wise but team wise togetherness things like that that weve seen in the last 5 or 6 years
5922369 i want it to end in wheeling so we just got to come out and do what were supposed to do if everybody does their job well be good i think
5922370 it feels great to play on the wyoming east football team friday nights when the lights come on the stands are packed its just exciting and fun to play
5922371 its crazy its a wild environment but up front we should we should beat them up front have a good game and come out on top
5922372 thats a good clean county rivalry weve not going to lie we want to beat westside in everything and they want to beat us but thats what its all about thats what high school sports is about
5922373 a fight is going on inside me it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves one wolf represents fear anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies pride and superiority the other wolf stands for joy peace love hope sharing serenity humility kindness benevolence friendship empathy generosity truth compassion and faith this same fight is going on inside of you and every other person too
5922374 are you sure shes not the last lady of country music instead of the first
5922375 you can say the man was still in his senses despite his injuries he couldnt speak but he communicated with gestures police captain herman ruben gab told telam news agency after he responded to an emergency call by the mans nephew who heard the shots
5922376 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5922377 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5922378 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5922379 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5922380 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5922381 common denominator that allows for the discrimination of the living from the non living
5922382 a deterministic emergence of life would reflect an essential continuity between physics chemistry and biology
5922383 we propose that the only absolute requirements for life are a thermodynamic disequilibrium and temperatures consistent with chemical bonding
5922384 organisms do not maintain their complexity and become more complex in a vacuum their high organization and low entropy is made up for by pollution heat and entropic export to their surroundings
5922385 the pleasure the depth the craft of our subject lie in the details of how living organisms work out the solution to their challenges within the framework of physical law
5922386 more elaborate pathways leading to the complex amino acids nucleic acids and cofactors follow from these elementary steps in a dense and surprisingly simple web of reactions
5922387 it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us these laws taken in the largest sense being growth with reproduction inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less improved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved
5922388 unitary structures with coherent properties that can operate in an integrated way which allows for the acceptance of their changes on large time scales as evolutionary
5922389 an autonomous agent is something that can both reproduce itself and do at least one thermodynamic work cycle it turns out that this is true of all free living cells excepting weird special cases they all do work cycles just like the bacterium spinning its flagellum as it swims up the glucose gradient the cells in your body are busy doing work cycles all the time
5922390 living beings continuously lose information and would sink to thermodynamic equilibrium just as surely as nonliving systems do there is only one way to keep a system from sinking to equilibrium to infuse new information t o maintain its high order an organism must continuously pump in information now this is precisely what the protein demons do inside an organism they take information from the environment and funnel it into the organism by virtue of the conservation law this means that the environment must undergo an equivalent increase in thermodynamic entropy for every bit of information the organism gains the entropy in the demons environment must rise by a certain amount there is thus a trade off here an information for entropy barter and it is this curious trade which the protein demons ply indeed they know it from the ground up and have honed it to perfection bartering nonstop they draw in huge information amounts and so manage to maintain the organism above equilibrium and locally to turn the thermodynamic arrow around
5922391 thus when we try to explain how the whole system behaves we have to talk about its parts the context of the whole and cannot get away talking only about the parts
5922392 the constituent parts and processes of a living thing are related to the organism as a whole by a kind of reciprocal causation
5922393 all living organisms from the humble amoeba to the human are born with devices designed to solve automatically no proper reasoning required the basic problems of life those problems are finding sources of energy incorporating and transforming energy maintaining a chemical balance of the interior compatible with the life process maintaining the organisms structure by repairing its wear and tear and fending off external agents of disease and physical injury
5922394 we propose that the only absolute requirements for life are a thermodynamic disequilibrium and temperatures consistent with chemical bonding
5922395 what we really need to focus on is coming up with an adequately general theory of living systems as opposed to a definition of life
5922396 yet even the majestic giant sequoia is not the record holder
5922397 complex plasmas a state of matter common in outer space consisting of a mass of charged particles may naturally self organize themselves into stable interacting helical structures that exhibit features normally attributed to organic living matter the self organization is based on non trivial physical mechanisms of plasma interactions involving over screening of plasma polarization as a result each helical string composed of solid microparticles is topologically and dynamically controlled by plasma fluxes leading to particle charging and over screening the latter providing attraction even among helical strings of the same charge sign these interacting complex structures exhibit thermodynamic and evolutionary features thought to be peculiar only to living matter such as bifurcations that serve as memory marks self duplication metabolic rates in a thermodynamically open system and non hamiltonian dynamics we examine the salient features of this new complex state of soft matter in light of the autonomy evolution progenity and autopoiesis principles used to define life it is concluded that complex self organized plasma structures exhibit all the necessary properties to qualify them as candidates for inorganic living matter that may exist in space provided certain conditions allow them to evolve naturally
5922398 those who are aware of the most recent advances in plant cell biology are convinced that cell theory as it now stands is absolutely incompatible with a cell based organization of higher plants and requires an update
5922399 energy flow embeds life within the geosphere not just mechanistically but conceptually as an inevitable form of driven geochemical order
5922400 the production of motive power is then due in steam engines not to an actual consumption of caloric quantity of heat but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body that is to its re establishment of equilibrium
5922401 evolution in these circumstances proceeds in such direction as to make the total energy flux through the system a maximum compatible with the constraints
5922402 life may be the ultimate in planetary stress relief morowitz and smith argue that life was the necessary consequence of available energy built up by geological processes on the early earth life sprang from this environment they say in the same way that lightning relieves the accumulation of electrical charge in thunderclouds
5922403 the common ancestor of eukaryotes bacteria and archaea may have been a community of organisms containing the following autotrophs that produced organic compounds from co2 either photosynthetically or by inorganic chemical reactions heterotrophs that obtained organics by leakage from other organisms saprotrophs that absorbed nutrients from decaying organisms and phagotrophs that were sufficiently complex to envelop and digest prey
5922404 we assert that reproduction and evolution are not constitutive features of the living organization and that the properties of a unity cannot be accounted for only through ac counting for the properties of its components
5922405 we also claim that all biological phenomenology including reproduction and evolution is secondary to the establishment of this unitary organization
5922406 what is the necessary and sufficient organization for a given system to be a living unity
5922407 the title of this 1986 work dawkinss second book refers to the rev william paleys 1802 work
5922408 the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics albeit deployed in a very special way it is the blind watchmaker
5922409 the biochemical factory that autonomously fabricates itself a systems biological view of the living cell
5922410 aristotle 384 322 bce wanted to search for explanations of natural events that inspire wonder
5922411 darwinian medicine is the treatment of disease based on evolution the underlying assumption of darwinian medicine is that traits are coded by genes which are often assumed to be sequences of dna nucleotides the quantitative genetic ramification of this perspective is that traits including disease susceptibility are either caused by genes or by the environment with genotype by environment interactions usually considered statistical artefacts i emphasize also examining those epigenetic signals that can be altered by environmental perturbations and then transmitted to subsequent generations although seldom studied environmentally alterable meiotically heritable epigenetic signals exist and provide a mechanism underlying genotype by environment interactions environment of a parent can affect its descendants by heritably altering epigenetic signals neo lamarckian medicine is the application of these evolutionary epigenetic notions to diseases and could have enormous public health and environmental policy implications if industrial contaminants adversely affect organisms by meiotically heritably altering their epigenetic signals then cleaning up these contaminants will not remedy the problem once contaminants have adversely altered an individuals epigenetic signals this harm will be transmitted to future generations even if they are not exposed to the contaminant exposure to environmental shocks such as free radicals or other carcinogens can alter cytosine methylation patterns on regulatory genes this can cause cancer by up regulating genes for cell division or by down regulating tumour suppressor genes environmentally alterable meiotically heritable epigenetic signals could also underlie other diseases such as diabetes prader willi syndrome and many complex diseases if environmentally altered meiotically heritable epigenetic effects are widespread which is an important open empirical question they have the potential to alter paradigmatic views of evolutionary medicine and the putative dichotomy of nature versus nurture neo lamarckian medicine would thereby shift emphasis from cure to prevention of diseases
5922412 populations of ants and other social insects self organize and develop emergent properties through stigmergy in which individual ants communicate with one another via chemical trails of pheromones that attract or repulse other ants in this way sophisticated properties and functions develop under appropriate conditions in vitro microtubule preparations initially comprised of only tubulin and gtp behave in a similar manner they self organize and develop other higher level emergent phenomena by a process where individual microtubules are coupled together by the chemical trails they produce by their own reactive growing and shrinking this behaviour is described and compared with the behaviour of ant colonies viewing microtubules as populations of molecular ants may provide new insights as to how the cytoskeleton may spontaneously develop high level functions it is plausible that such processes occur during the early stages of embryogenesis and in cells
5922413 stem cells may be considered complex reactive systems because of their vast number in a living system their reactive nature and the influence of local environmental factors such as the state of neighboring cells tissue matrix stem cell physiological processes on their behavior in such systems emergent global behavior arises through the multitude of local interactions among the cell agents approaching hematopoietic and other stem cell lineages from this perspective have critical ramifications on current thinking relating to the plasticity of these lineage systems the modeling of stem cell systems and the interpretation of clinical data regarding many diseases within such models
5922414 it is not a library at all but a room full of souls no one wanted
5922415 just not my life isa disaster my sister picked a great time to pull this off at east one of us is at peace now though
5922416 employing him as a reliever for the remainder of the year
5922417 i cant speak for the rest of the board but as an individual director i think it is going to be very hard to salvage this project
5922418 given the facts that have been presented to me today
5922419 if theres a smoking gun theres no sense continuing looking for the bullets
5922420 caused mr shainskiy to trust vartan in a way he would otherwise not have done
5922421 rely completely on george vartan to advise and guide him
5922422 all of a sudden in the last five six years predators figured this out that these elderly people have a lot of financial gain and it just evolved
5922423 not to say there still isnt a lot of nursing home abuse thats sadly still continuing but definitely the evolution has been to this financial sector
5922424 we are pleased to offer our customers a new wide grade full synthetic diesel engine oil that combines advantages of the synthetic stocks and performance of an advanced additive to deliver undiminished protection for heavy duty engines operating in extreme applications that range from high to low in temperature and service
5922425 as the performance requirements and market conditions elevate the demand for superior quality heavy duty engine oils conocophillips company is dedicated to offering newer products that meet industry specifications while exceeding our customers needs
5922426 they said people in san diego are making comments that could affect our company im not sure we should do business here
5922427 im not privileged to say because of confidentialities we have with organized labor where we sit with that but the bottom line is im optimistic that will not be an impediment to the future
5922428 gaylord is still very committed to this project and we wish the process could be accelerated
5922429 but we understand that it is a large public process dealing with one of the largest waterfront redevelopment projects in the nation
5922430 we certainly have noticed a slowdown of projects going from planning to construction
5922431 across the country there is a bubble of projects that are just sitting there

5922438 some of russias actions were disproportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
5922439 dont ask us whos good and whos bad here we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war
5922440 as an incumbent on the existing fast contract well continue our role of providing innovative solutions and services to meet the readiness and sustainment requirements of our customer
5922441 will pretty much be completed wherever they need it to be done
5922442 we hang out off the field and were all best friends but we know when to get serious and play
5922443 everybody sees how well the juniors play and how good of friends they are
5922444 the chemistry on the field is a carry over from their social lives
5922445 to win a championship they need to learn to take control in bigger games
5922446 if were healthy this year its gonna be tough to beat us
5922447 weve got some players who if theyre healthy can dictate the play of the game
5922448 a lot of the way visa office decision making on refugees goes is there seems to be a kind of trend that goes on in decision making
5922449 the impression we get often is they kind of make generalizations or they make general decisions about what were going to say about the situation in the country of origin and theyre quite influenced about what the unhcr might say
5922450 we are seeing a trend toward voluntary repatriation to afghanistan it is a positive thing it has been going on several years and unhcr has been supporting it
5922451 it signals that there are places in afghanistan that people are able to go back to the vast majority of the people returning are from frontier provinces pakistan
5922452 we get lots of calls from overseas but also from friends and families here in canada but we dont have the capacity and also the acceptance rate is low the rate has dropped down because some of the reports coming from the government trying to paint a rosy picture of afghanistan
5922453 if it is essential for our troops to be there there is a need
5922454 save innocent pashtun people from the war drama between al qaida and pakistani military agencies
5922455 i take a big sigh because its been a really very long standing frustration weve had that we do not feel that the review or assessment that a refugee has or receives overseas is equivalent to or as consistent as what they might get in canada
5922456 through this project we hope to obtain information that will help improve the quality transparency and consistency in making and communicating decisions identify any visa officer training gaps develop working tools for visa officers and make recommendations with respect to ongoing quality assurance monitoring of the program
5922457 theres been a really disturbing pattern of poor decision making
5922458 every single case where ive begun litigation on a refusal the government has recognized the problem before going to court
5922459 the spate of flooding related incidents which stretched our resources and operational control centre has now eased
5922460 for him to call us advocates or fanatics it doesnt cut it
5922461 this is a very pervasive attitude on the part of the federal government interfering with our ability to offer a low threshold service to deal with some of the most difficult to reach individuals
5922462 it represents really a bias and unacceptable position that undermines some public health policy
5922463 its shame in my position as president of the ias i feel i dont have the support of the federal government and i cannot be seen bringing my federal government with me to the table when were discussing these very important issues at the international level
5922464 weve shown in the paper we published on july 1 st that if we were to expand anti retroviral therapy from the current 50 per cent coverage among those with the medical indication to be treated to a 75 per cent coverage we would be in a situation where we would see a reduction of new hiv infections of about 30 per cent
5922465 so this is the fundamentals if we can truly move in that regard we can make a difference
5922466 to me theres something that keeps coming to my head and its a colin powell statement where he referred to hiv aids as the single biggest threat to global security even after 9 11
5922467 obviously they would have been doing some good work in guyana because they would have been taking canadian experience and canadian exposure into the respective countries
5922468 those would be new experiences that they would be imparting
5922469 so on the overall basis our countries would benefit to some extent with the presence of those individuals
5922470 obviously the more experienced person would be helpful to us but from the students point of view
5922471 it would be advantageous to them because it would give them greater exposure and immediately put into practice what they have learned in school so from that point of view the student would lose out
5922472 because a lot of the organizations youre working with theyre strapped for human resources so they can really make good use of an intern and theyre more than happy to have a young canadian around
5922473 that being said you also have to take the initiative and figure out where you can fit in and where you can help even though i was there to do gender work i ended up doing a needs assessment for the financial sector so you have these opportunities that just kind of come to you that you wouldnt get in a lot of other positions
5922474 its so difficult to get into this industry and work in international development without having that opportunity
5922475 and its getting even more competitive now and the need for internships is greater not less than what it used to be
5922476 they talk about canadian engagement this is one of the best ways to do it
5922477 this is a breeding ground for cida workers and it allows young people to get the experience they desperately need in order to get employment in international development
5922478 this program is for developing countries and its also for canada to enable us to exercise our abilities to help other countries help themselves
5922479 if the government were interested in the program they would have renewed it by now and given it a longer mandate
5922480 this government the conservative government has cut a number of programs that have helped young people and enabled youth to get experience in areas of employment and in a time of surplus these are not the areas to cut you dont cut the human infrastructure abilities of our country and thats what this government has been doing
5922481 there is a need for a program like ypi to provide international work experience and employability skills that youth require to enter employment which they would normally have difficulty obtaining
5922482 has been successful in positively impacting on participants and dfait
5922483 after their placements a majority of participants have the skills targeted by the program and are employed up to two years following completion
5922484 is reaping benefits for the department as well by helping the department meet its priorities and by strengthening ties
5922485 the program was building canadas image of human rights and constructive engagement with the rest of the world
5922486 it was really raising the canadian flag very high for a very minimal cost
5922487 i have not yet seen in this program any abuse or any mishaps
5922488 a decision has to be made by treasury board pretty shortly for things to roll out as they do
5922489 it was the first canadian warship visit to pakistan since the nations founding in 1947
5922490 it was a pretty big deal from a pakistani perspective they felt it was pretty important we were there
5922491 a lot of that drug smuggling comes down through baluchistan and goes on to the water where its shipped
5922492 theyll be the first to admit they cannot stop the drug trade
5922493 theyll be the first to admit they have challenges in managing the western pakistani areas where the taliban is located
5922494 we do tackle some of the drug shipments to try and break supply chain and effect the funding
5922495 if we can stop the trade in hashish that comes out of afghanistan thats eventually going to hurt the taliban
5922496 with whats going on in afghanistan its important for canada to have some ties in pakistan as well
5922497 the potential windfall for criminals insurgents and terrorists is staggering and runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars
5922498 since drugs are funding the insurgency nato has a self interest in supporting afghan forces in destroying drug labs markets and convoys destroy the drug trade and you cut off the talibans main funding source
5922499 in pakistans tribal areas where there is no government you can freely travel
5922500 baluchistan is the same thing again and you can continue up to the ocean its easy to smuggle anything
5922501 if theyre not capable of controlling tribal areas how do you think they will stop the trafficking
5922502 like in afghanistan a lot of the traffickers in baluchistan are very well connected to senior officials so theres a lot of complicity there
5922503 killed rapidly and effectively without causing avoidable pain distress fear and other forms of suffering using a variety of methods
5922504 that was good they helped us identify some issues we want to explore further
5922505 across the country our universities and colleges arent graduating enough people to fill that demand especially in the upcoming years
5922506 i think that they have not thought through this properly theyre just listening to the employers theyre not taking the perspective of immigrants
5922507 this conservative government would rather use stopgap measures to address one of canadas greatest economic and population challenges
5922508 reflects that we are balancing away from a largely military to more of a civilian mission
5922509 i suspect and were already getting an indication that foreign affairs has money and other parts of cida have money and theyre going to use the cgso platform
5922510 theres an expectation by a lot of people if it turns out well and every indication is that its going to turn out well there will be more resources
5922511 can we handle 100 million yeah we can handle a lot more than that
5922512 more civilians more diplomacy more development more counseling i favour that rather than investing millions and millions in more soldiers and military equipment
5922513 i dont see how they can rebalance the mission if thats their intention with seven or eight people embedded within the afghan bureaucracy
5922514 i think what it requires is a very significant human resources influx not just seven or eight people
5922515 if we believe the solution cannot be a military solution if it has to be development and diplomacy then they have to be putting money where their mouth is
5922516 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
5922517 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
5922518 one of biggest mitigating measures is to make sure weve got the right expert that understands whats going on around them
5922519 yes its dangerous but at the same time we have a lot of individuals who want to take these risks that are bound and determined to assist afghanistan to move things forward
5922520 the time has come for the world to recognize that a free and democratic ukraine is as essential to a stable europe as a free and democratic russia or as free and democratic baltic states
5922521 this is we understand part of your design to see ukraine embrace the transatlantic community and our shared democratic and free market values ukraine has always demonstrated its commitment to our nato allies in fact ukraine is the only non nato country supporting every nato mission in some way or other

5922530 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5922531 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5922532 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation

5922584 i think it the investment in russo has paid for itself already
5922585 the front page of newspapers the fact that so many press people came here today shows the importance of chris russo i was shocked he was available
5922586 wfan made the decision to let chris go that decision was made

5922594 in the beginning we used to take people up in airplanes to show them what is going on just over the next ridge
5922595 people were shocked at the magnitude but now we simply use satellites remote sensing and virtual globes to get the message out and let our neighbors view these ravaged mountains the proof is in the image a 3 d view has really transformed this issue and that wakes people right up this is one of the most powerful tools ever for our effort
5922596 using the virtual globe technologies we can show the connection of mining operations to the delivery of electricity into peoples homes
5922597 we are going to be doing a lot of looking at mountains that are standing but threatened we need modelers to help us look at the spread of mtr and modelers to study the extent of pollution along rivers and communities we are working with sky truth and would certainly welcome help from the remote sensing community
5922598 we are working to determine and map the areas most likely to be mined in the near future
5922599 we are launching the web based adopt a mountain tool to enable average citizens to help us with ground truth and field verification prior to the destruction
5922600 and are looking for talented gis and remote sensing professionals
5922601 i think we had a little more experience than they had and im sure theyre going to get better in the years to come

5922604 i want most of the girls to be able to say theyre gotten better
5922605 the bulk of the 21 players are sophomores so if they learn a little bit this year and get a little better next year maybe by the time theyre seniors theyll be pretty good
5922606 i told them do not let them come into our house after we won two games and let them win two
5922607 every time before every break we come together and we pump everybody up and talk to each other
5922608 we tell each other that if they make a mistake we try to cheer them up
5922609 coming from lacees mouth she is usually says there is no pressure just do what you do at practice
5922610 the main thing was that we were getting out hustled
5922611 pamlico played great the first two games and they were moving their feet better than we were getting the balls and i told them they were getting out hustled they responded in the third and fourth game
5922612 it doesnt matter what she is doing she gets excited she is 100 percent in everything she does and it just carries over to the volleyball court and to her teammates as well
5922613 i told them that in the third and the fourth games pamlico beat us to 10 both times
5922614 so i wanted to see us get to 10 first and then did it we had a 10 7 lead and just couldnt hold on
5922615 was the kind of guy you wanted to room with not fly with he was reckless and thats critical when you start thinking about whos going to be the president
5922616 but the navy accident rate was cut in half the day john mccain was shot down
5922617 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

5922671 we never have enough time in the summer to get everything done that we need to get done
5922672 well it was good to get back to practice today
5922673 it was good that the players got a couple of days off we did get some time to review the film with them make corrections and do a walk thru with them we spent some time with some of the younger players to help them improve and develop at this time of the year usually after the second scrimmage we make lists on offense and defense at every position and position specific of what we need to do to improve and help our performance weve had some time to do that now and those things were kind of emphasized today in practice as well as some things we havent had as much time to work on
5922674 i was encouraged by the scrimmage after watching the film of the scrimmage
5922675 we are not disappointed at all with where we are right now but we certainly recognize the fact that we have a lot of things we can improve on todays practice and tomorrows practice will be kind of dedicated to try and to improve on the fundamental things we need to do to get better and some of things that we havent been able to practice enough on and then thursday we will probably center our focus more toward the first game
5922676 each one of these guys has played the most significant role of any of the guys who have walked on our team
5922677 i think this is a message to all guys that want to walk on we try to reinforce positive performance guys that become contributors to our team in any way shape of form we certainly like to put them on scholarship when scholarships are available we are happy and pleased that we able to reward these guys for their effort and contribution to the team

5922714 hey caitlin i love you im still here and still thinking of you
5922715 old time locals did not like it i think they were worried about santa barbaras reputation
5922716 it is not intended to be representative of santa barbaras reputation i was not worried about that
5922717 it seemed such a unique and foreign place high class compared to the midwest
5922718 should be able to tell by my writing that i was impressed by santa barbara and the coast

5922722 i cant change my batting average but i can still help this team win
5922723 some critics however either in written form or safe in the relative seclusion the internet provides and the behavior such seclusion encourages are either misinformed or uninformed about developments in biblical scholarship over the last several generations but speak with a disturbing air of self confidence and an astonishing capacity to block or selectively engage or even twist counterarguments that some of these critics are professional academics or pastors is lamentable from my point of view and i am disappointed that so much heat is being generated with the nearly complete absence of light
5922724 those who desire to maintain a vibrant and reverent doctrine of scripture but who find it difficult to do so because they find familiar and conventional approaches to newer problems to be unhelpful i am very eager to affirm that many evangelical instincts are correct and should be maintained for example the conviction that the bible is ultimately from god and that it is gods gift to the church
5922725 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5922726 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5922727 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5922728 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5922729 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5922730 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5922731 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5922732 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5922733 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5922734 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5922735 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5922736 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us it is a day that i will never forget and a memory that i will always cherish on behalf of my family i would like to extend sympathies to the orthwein family
5922737 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter
5922738 yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public
5922739 when luis was here i wanted him behind the plate all the time because of his defen sive skills
5922740 but unfortunately he got hurt a couple of times and tried to play hurt and we couldnt go with that if you dont have your legs you cant play no matter what sport it is and i wanted him back there because of his arm
5922741 mike and chris have done a decent job behind the plate but theyre not the caliber of luis
5922742 were all professionals here so before i catch i make sure i talk to the guy go over a game plan well talk in the bullpen ill see how much theyre breaking ball is breaking how much movement their fastball has because of the catching situation its not like i never show up unprepared i love catching
5922743 butch hobson said can you catch and i said sure
5922744 i threw out three baserunners i caught regularly and made the all star game ever since then ive been learning not how to call a game but how to react and read what the hitters are trying to do how to pick up tendencies
5922745 i would say im more comfortable with all the pitchers because i work with them every day as opposed to the other guys
5922746 i understand if you catch every day its tough on your body but thats why you stay in shape its tough if youre not catching their bullpen seeing what theyre working on and seeing what theyre going through they pitchers might surprise you with something
5922747 its tough on both parts the pitcher needs to be confident in the catcher and the catcher needs to be confident in these pitchers thats a big part of it
5922748 and when they wanted to work luis would go down there to the pen and work on stuff its just been an odd year a lot of injuries
5922749 they know these hitters especially mike whos been in this league for awhile theyre baseball guys the catching and pitching havent been bumping heads or anything like that
5922750 the bottom line is the pitcher has to know what they want to throw a catcher gives suggestions but we have the final say we have the era we have the wins and losses so pitchers have to call their game and we do and we blend well
5922751 pitchers have an idea of how they want to pitch to these guys especially some of us who have been in the league for awhile it comes down to you have to execute the pitch regardless whatevers called whether you agree with it or shake it off and throw something else you have to execute it anyway
5922752 theyre both good receiving catchers they both have good arms theyre both quick behind the plate and they know the hitters each catcher has different tendencies pitcher to pitcher they go with what they think is working that day
5922753 i know that pitchers like to pitch to a certain guy all the time but i think its more of a superstition thing than a comfort
5922754 pitchers dont have to worry about thinking ahead and if they only have to worry about one thing executing their pitches then theyre more effective they do like a catcher who knows how to call a game that makes them feel more comfortable
5922755 you just have to get on the same page i guess it takes like one game really to get used to the guy
5922756 if you play in this league more than once you expect that it can be a problem sometimes but for the most part our pitchers dont really worry about it they just go out and pitch to whoevers behind the plate
5922757 depending on the pitcher it could bother them and i could see how but we just try to get with the pitcher and the catcher at the same time and say this is what he likes this is the tendency
5922758 at the end of the day theyre both adults and have to work together
5922759 i guess youll have to talk to coach dungy and see what happens im getting excited im ready to go and hopefully ill get out there this week
5922760 i think playing in a game is important just to get the chemistry back with the first guys and getting your timing down
5922761 i think if you get that down you play a little better
5922762 my body feels good im just trying to be smart about the things i do on and off the field
5922763 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5922764 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5922765 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5922766 he didnt intend for any of that to happen and certainly neither did we
5922767 hes never mailed it in he just hasnt stayed healthy so its been unfortunate for us
5922768 i walk past him every day and i think he is just so so
5922769 we chose oneal based on his influence and expertise in basketball
5922770 our cooperation will bring everything possible to chinas basketball fans
5922771 in my dreams at night shaq is just that tall

5922774 kobe is younger and that shaq over there is fatter
5922775 shaq cant sing in real life and here he will not be able to sing
5922776 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5922777 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5922778 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5922779 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and manager davey johnson says he can go he can go
5922780 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5922781 i had bike issues somewhere in the middle of the bike leg i gave everything i had
5922782 if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5922783 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5922784 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5922785 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5922786 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5922787 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5922788 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5922789 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5922790 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5922791 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5922792 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5922793 ill be damned if some foreign soul suckin graffiti writin son of a bitch in an oversized cowboy hat and boots take my friends souls and shit em down the visitors toilet
5922794 it was not a shock but i cant say its a pleasant surprise
5922795 but when the person you have is good people are going to go after them its bittersweet good for him unlucky for us but i know were going to be in good hands moving forward
5922796 its the only way it can be the quality of the person were looking for is to continue what weve got someone who will sink their teeth into this for as long term a process as they possibly can
5922797 but some things changed id be the top assistant and the recruiting coordinator and i felt if i let it go by i dont know it would come around again its been my goal to work with scholarships
5922798 next year i believe the program will take a turn at daniel webster

5922803 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

5922828 im not really worried or focused on that because i dont plan on getting into any trouble im happy to be back and just ready to move forward work on my game and do whatever i can to help the team
5922829 this last three four months have been very humbling for chris
5922830 the week after the charges were dropped the phone didnt ring being on the street was very humbling
5922831 it would have been a terrible waste for his talent to be on the street
5922832 im glad hes getting another chance hopefully he can right the ship i know its going to be an uphill battle for him but hes my teammate and im going to support him

5922839 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
5922840 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
5922841 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
5922842 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drug makers what they need to exert more influence
5922843 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5922844 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5922845 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you

5922881 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5922882 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5922883 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said

5922887 our goal is to provide families a musical outlet in an environment where their kids will be valued challenged and encouraged and come away with a love of music

5922913 we have held steadfast to the belief that for fiji to enjoy national unity and lasting peace and prosperity it must embrace an electoral system that is non racial and democratic ensuring a vote of equal value
5922914 electoral reforms are a highly sensitive and contentious issue and must have the broad consensus of our people
5922915 apart from the need for wide political consultations the views of the people of fiji and civil society at large will have to be sought before any changes are accepted and adopted
5922916 we believe that there should be more coordination leadership guidance and a higher priority set on school safety by the department of elementary and secondary education
5922917 the flavor of the audit is that there needs to be more state oversight and policing of school districts but im less convinced that would result in safer schools
5922918 i think safe schools are a priority of every local school district and im unsure that more bureaucracy at the state level would necessarily help

5922925 si fidel es comunista ponme en la lista l est en lo cierto
5922926 el cartel era parte de la campa a del partido y de fidel para preparar a la poblaci n para el comunismo del cual muy poca gente sab a algo la idea era que dado que fidel ya hab a hecho que su nombre fuera sin nimo del mes as cubano deb a tener raz n con respecto al comunismo
5922927 cinco o seis d as despu s a altas horas de la madrugada vinieron a mi casa el dormitorio de mi madre era el que estaba m s cerca de la puerta de entrada as que ella fue quien escuch tocar a la puerta y se levant a abrir cuando abri la puerta los hombres la apartaron de en medio a empujones y se apresuraron dentro de la casa me despert con una ametralladora contra la sien

5922931 todos los m todos represivos y t cticas han fallado para forzar a cierto grupo de prisioneros contrarrevolucionarios a aceptar la rehabilitaci n pol tica

5922942 those with higher incomes welcome pain almost by choice usually through exercise at lower incomes pain comes as the result of work
5922943 the study first released in a british journal found americans in households making less than 30 000 a year spend nearly 20 percent of their lives in moderate to severe pain compared with less than 8 percent of people in households earning above 100 000 high school drop outs were susceptible to twice the amount of pain as college graduates

5922952 its game on the moneys in the bank were going to have a huge financial advantage let the mccain campaign chase us around the country if they can find us
5922953 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
5922954 with a partisan record that doesnt measure up barack obamas been reduced to a sucker punch strategy shirking his new type of politics in favor of a more negative campaign
5922955 they may understand that this race is a lot tougher than they originally thought it was going to be
5922956 i believe the fundamentals of this economy are strong and i believe they will remain strong this is a rough patch
5922957 you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically while bush was in office thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic difficulties

5922966 trq administration provisions of the 2008 farm bill require that the raw and refined trqs must be set at the bound minimum level and not increased prior to april 1 of each quota year in the absence of an emergency shortage of sugar caused by
5922967 these provisions also require that in the event of an emergency shortage of sugar usda must first increase the raw trq and only if such increased raw imports are insufficient to eliminate the shortage may usda increase the refined trq above the minimum level
5922968 although these provisions do not become effective until october 1 2008 usdas decision to extend the period for delivery under the 2007 08 refined trq to december 31 2008 raises serious questions of compliance with the trq administration requirements of the 2008 farm bill
5922969 by increasing the amount of refined sugar that can enter during october 1 december 31 2008 without first increasing the raw trq for that period above the bound minimum level usda has done an end run around the intent of congress thereby de facto achieving what congress de jure prohibited
5922970 usdas increase in the refined trq for the period october 1 december 31 2008 represents the third time in a little over a month that it has disregarded the legitimate rights of the traditional suppliers of sugar under the trq
5922971 on june 23 2008 usda reassigned the cane sugar overall allotment quantity oaq shortfall exclusively to mexico ignoring the trq holders
5922972 this mission and the istc wrote to you on july 3 2008 expressing concern that both the intent of congress and the wto obligations of the united states require that the trq holders participate in any such oaq shortfall reassignment
5922973 these concerns were disregarded when on july 10 2008 usda increased the oaq to unblock domestic beet stocks and again assigned resulting cane sugar oaq shortfall exclusively to mexico
5922974 although mexico now has unlimited access to the u s sugar market pursuant to nafta mexicos nafta rights do not supersede the wto rights of the traditional suppliers under the trq
5922975 article xxiv of gatt 1994 authorises free trade agreements only insofar as they do not prejudice access by other suppliers
5922976 we continue to have serious concerns that usdas decision to assign the 2007 08 oaq shortfalls exclusively to mexico has prejudiced access to the u s sugar market by the traditional quota holders such as fiji within the meaning of gatt article xxiv

5923058 north koreans are by far the most persecuted people in the world
5923059 the kim family created and imposed a quasi religious personality cult
5923060 is not merely a method of social control but the ideological basis of the kim familys political legitimacy independent religious practice is considered a direct political threat
5923061 south korean missionaries or aid workers as such a confession does risk much more severe punishment including the interviewees believed potential execution or being sent to the kwanliso political penal labor camps
5923062 continued to be pressed during interrogation for details about attending church meeting missionaries watching south korean television and meeting south koreans
5923063 recent data confirms that the north korean regimes policy of penalizing north koreans for coming into contact with religious institutions or persons or for meeting with south koreans continues
5923064 spying for south korea is conflated with cultural aggression by american imperialism through the infiltration into north korea of poisonous ideology with the aim of liquidating socialism in explaining the north korean view the former police agents explicitly cited the long standing government attack on protestant christianity
5923065 all believed that they were included for international consumption and did not reflect domestic practice
5923066 recounted how they had been taught by university professors or superiors that such provisions existed to create the appearance of compliance with international norms but were not something they would expect the government to follow
5923067 were not for the north korean people but were showplaces for foreigners and not real churches like those in china and south korea
5923068 consequences of owning such material were well known and if the religious material was associated with protestant christianity punishment could include execution and the imprisonment of three generations of the owners family
5923069 three mutually reinforcing reasons for the lack of religious freedom
5923070 anti religious propaganda is ubiquitous and reinforced through the educational system mass media and the workplace
5923071 it is widely known that there are severe penalties meted out against those discovered practicing banned religions many interviewees testified that they had heard about or witnessed severe persecution of persons caught engaging in religious activity
5923072 refugees consistently report that any religious activity is deemed illegal by the regime and practitioners can be arrested sent to political prison camp kwanliso or executed
5923073 torture mistreatment and the disappearance of those suspected of religious activity
5923074 desperate because if they dont catch two or more cases they cannot get promoted and they might get kicked out
5923075 that veneration of the kim family or kimilsungism was the official state ideology and the only belief system allowed to exist in north korea
5923076 highly elaborate and structured belief system based on the semi deification of kim il sung and his family
5923077 provided consistent testimony to the way this cult of personality dominates their daily lives and the penalties associated with questioning or challenging its mandatory rites and requirements
5923078 what seems to be a network of quasi functioning buddhist temples preserved as cultural heritage sites as well as rise in
5923079 in the border regions with china there is evidence of clandestine protestant activity that is actively combated and repressed by the regime which views the existence of such activity as an ideological and security threat
5923080 to attract repatriated refugees who had converted in china and also to infiltrate religious groups in china
5923081 who confess to religious belief or are suspected of spreading christianity
5923082 christianity was suppressed more than buddhism because it is against the one and only ideology kim il sung is god a real god cannot replace him
5923083 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
5923084 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
5923085 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
5923086 obama has spent a large amount of money in florida and his numbers dont seem to be moving
5923087 we dont vote on that issue alone just because thats what our grandparents did
5923088 first a confession of faith involves a conflict not merely between theological schools within the church but a conflict between the true and false church a conflict that divides the churches while love for the erring brethren may still prevail the division is extremely painful and deep wounds are inflicted secondly a confession of faith is a decision in which the first shall be last and the last shall be first and none may glory save in the lord
5923089 it occurs when the church is convinced that its faith and unity are grievously imperiled by a heresy that has ripened and come to a head
5923090 who taught that in addition to gods revelation in christ attested by scripture there is a natural revelation in nature and history
5923091 german blood race and soil and in the event of the national socialist revolution and rebirth of the german soul
5923092 the culmination of the errors of the theology of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
5923093 we are raising a protest against the same phenomenon that has been slowly preparing the way for the devastation of the church for more than two hundred years for it is only a relative difference whether beside holy scripture in the church historical events or reason culture aesthetic feelings progress or other powers and figures are said to be binding claims upon the church
5923094 anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of christ does not have god the one who abides in the teaching he has both the father and the son
5923095 iii resolution of the confessional synod of the german evangelical church
5923096 if you have the strength to survive you have the power to succeed
5923097 her poetry provides valuable insights into the wide range of human experiences her moving explorations of the many faces of love are enthralling inspiring and thoughtful
5923098 as late as february 15th ed muskie was general conceded to be within an eyelash or two of having the democratic nomination so skillfully locked up that the primaries wouldnt even be necessary
5923099 he had the public endorsements of almost every big name in the party including some who said they were only backing him because he was so far ahead that nobody else had a chance
5923100 despite spending 100 million team clinton had somehow failed to establish ground operations in all but a handful of upcoming states
5923101 mccain showed that he can be a much more formidable and effective campaigner in a joint appearance than hardly anyone imagined

5923136 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5923137 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform

5923219 the key reason for the revival in early rising culture is that it teaches people to control their emotions feelings and desires
5923220 it is training in spiritual determination so people feel motivated to contribute selflessly to a common cause
5923221 that cause can often be economic but there are clear signs that many of these movements encourage people to take pride in their country and the part they play in japanese life in some ways they are being urged to overcome their own spiritual weaknesses and replace them with nationalist pride

5923231 although many studies such as those by the united nations environment programme finance initiative unep fi show a positive association between investors use of esg criteria and enhanced financial performance the data is still inconclusive and mainstream investors remain skeptical
5923232 this report looks beyond socially responsible investors and explores how mainstream financial institutions can advance the use of esg criteria to maximize financial performance
5923233 using the information in our report mainstream investors and businesses will learn how to overcome common challenges and integrate esg criteria into investment decisions
5923234 once this happens more mainstream investors will begin to analyze esg issues as part of their overall assessment of a company positively impacting both financial results and sustainability
5923235 it is our experience that collaborative efforts of investors non governmental organizations trade unions companies and industry associations can make a difference

5923252 i only saw the last 400m i fell asleep waiting for it i woke up with all the shouting from the tv
5923253 it looked like a typical nick race he likes to run the shortest possible way hes not keen running around the outside of the field
5923254 before he went to the states we were always planning he would be in bejing running the 1500m
5923255 he spoke to the students and donated them to the school
5923256 they are a very strong athletics family both his brother and sister have been individual athletics champions here at school
5923257 he is nothing but positive and its a brilliant reward
5923258 nick always had a talent more than that hes been a person whos been able to focus on what he wants to achieve and i think that focus is what mattered

5923267 i really think he is the most qualified democrat in the race for president
5923268 his track record is exceptional hes done a fine job as governor and was re elected with around 70 percent of the vote
5923269 if a democrat carries new mexico colorado and nevada we dont need ohio or florida to win richardson is very popular throughout the southwest and stands the best chance of being able to do that
5923270 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry
5923271 it is particularly sad that the president would choose to issue this threat during pride month which should be a celebration of glbt americans contributions to our nation as well as a celebration of the strides our nation has made towards full equality
5923272 i liked the sound of the stills debut lp logic will break your heart even if only a few of the songs proved fully formed and distinctive the montreal band will release their second cd without feathers on may 9th people are already remarking on the change in the groups sound as evidenced by opening track in the beginning as it happens i didnt care for that song and i dont much care for the rest of the album either yes thats one more 2006 disappointment for me but whos counting
5923273 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5923274 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5923275 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5923276 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5923277 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5923278 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5923279 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5923280 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5923281 you mean you dont remember why it was simply the most incredible display of power any one had seen you destroyed that terrorist and saved everyone
5923282 well rest up friend tomorrow you face me and i promise you i wont go easy on you
5923283 nothing did you not see what happened out there cid crossed the barrier that judas had erected around himself despite the efforts of that dog of his and in a flash of light erased that bastard from this world
5923284 impossible the guardian of earth was jack tep and we killed him
5923285 jack tep was the guardian of earth this is true yet when he died the mantel of it was passed on to another and that was his son cid
5923286 that i do not know of all the planets in this universe only the earth ever had a guardian a being of such power that he could hold off any threat the power of the guardian however was never fully tested the last guardian jack tep never understood his power and in the end it was his downfall
5923287 yes if cid is unable to fully use or understand his power he will be easy prey
5923288 answer me this calypso is he powerful enough to kill us
5923289 i dont know he might i am unable to sense just how powerful he may or may not be i guess it depends on who granted this power to him the almighty or the creator
5923290 well its the best i got however if we destroy this threat then we will truly be unstoppable war these are your games and it is up to you to ensure that he doesnt survive you are truly strong enough to handle a small impudent whelp such as he
5923291 no not at all i would just hate to get my hands dirty is all killing is such messy business after all
5923292 there is something very wrong about all of this and calypso knows more then what he is telling me
5923293 you did good out there my boy but your power is still too raw
5923294 just checking on you you really exerted yourself today and i must say that despite your best effort you have yet to fully grasp the full extent of your power right now you barely the strength to stand and rest assured that if they didnt know you were here before they do now
5923295 such arrogance you really think that you can take on all five of them at once you think your even a match for calypso in your current state you face him now and he will tear you apart
5923296 so you say but what do you care what do you really have at stake in all of this what do you care if i win or lose
5923297 that is my business and you will know when the time is right just stay alive wont you
5923298 well see i dont know satanus may be too much for even me i may die tomorrow and then what
5923299 fucking kid this generation has no respect back in my day we respected our elders
5923300 indeed and the crowds agree with you satanus is no slouch and easily will be cid greatest challenge
5923301 my children this years games have truly been something of wonder and it pleases me that you bravely returned despite the events of yesterday those terrorist known as the children of christ twice tried to ruin our games but rest assured that they will have no involvement in today games one can appreciate the skills that these two have and thus today will prove who truly is the greatest so for the final time this year we shall bear witness to greatness and thus let the games begin
5923302 i will kill you if need be in order to stop calypso
5923303 dont go easy on me satanus you hold back then i wont truly know if i am the best come at me with everything you got
5923304 i was testing you this whole fight is a test to see if you are truly ready to face the horsemen you are not ready and right now i could make your head explode i will end this charade and finish you myself
5923305 the fight wont end until one of us dies and you know it if you are to face war and the other horsemen then i must die
5923306 congratulations cid tep you have done phenomenally well but your fight isnt over yet oh no indeed it isnt now you must face me in a struggle to the death and with my mighty war hammer i shall see you dead
5923307 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5923308 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5923309 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5923310 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5923311 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5923312 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5923313 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5923314 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5923315 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5923316 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5923317 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5923318 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5923319 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5923320 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5923321 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5923322 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5923323 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5923324 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5923325 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5923326 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5923327 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5923328 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5923329 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5923330 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5923331 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5923332 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5923333 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5923334 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5923335 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5923336 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5923337 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5923338 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5923339 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5923340 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5923341 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5923342 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5923343 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5923344 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5923345 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5923346 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5923347 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5923348 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5923349 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5923350 mental health records on megan are important documents for both the defense and the prosecution
5923351 if the change in medication was a significant or even sole cause of megans suicide this is a relevant and important fact
5923352 to go back and try to get medical records and try to spread all these horrible things about my daughter is just absolutely pathetic
5923353 that she used to inflict emotional distress on a child
5923354 physician and nursing notes statements from family and others familiar with megans history and any documentation that addresses in any way megans prior mental health history
5923355 this is a 13 year old girl that is now gone and he is now going to try to discredit her mental state when this woman we have proof of what this woman did for a five week period
5923356 they can go up and jump in a lake before i ever give up my daughters medical records
5923357 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5923358 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5923359 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5923360 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5923361 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5923362 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5923363 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5923364 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5923365 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5923366 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5923367 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5923368 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5923369 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5923370 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5923371 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5923372 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5923373 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5923374 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5923375 who are open to doing something on the production side
5923376 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5923377 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5923378 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5923379 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5923380 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5923381 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5923382 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5923383 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5923384 through this bill we will prevent massive ejectment of delinquent borrowers and in parallel allow our government financial institutions with housing loan portfolio to collect over a longer period of time we help families hold on to their homes such as pag ibig borrowers of which 90 percent housing borrowers are delinquent
5923385 the most benefit will be felt by the poorer sectors the average amortizations of informal settlers or who have been resettled or relocated will be reduced radically the pag ibig borrower who pays p3 700 now and has become delinquent and qualifies in this bill will be paying only around p2 400 that difference will be a very big help
5923386 we managed to secure the commitment of the government financial institutions gfis to relax the rules at the same time we ensured that this will not unduly set back the actuarial security of the funds especially pag ibig which depends on member contributions and originally borrowerd loanable funds at a higher interest rate
5923387 this legislation will help borrowers more than the gfis were happy that the gfis promise not to close the doors on borrowers who are merely having a hard time paying up they will initiate collection of delinquent payments after the issues are clarified we want gfis to collect as well as assure that our housing problems will not be compounded with housing ejections
5923388 bringing them together as a group had forced them to compare their programs with others many relented to the more accommodating terms to help their borrowers
5923389 we define delinquent accounts as those with 3 months unpaid amortizations we chose to be liberal and went beyond business as usual
5923390 this is the most fun ive ever had in the rain in juneau
5923391 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular
5923392 why isnt a little stuffed bull running the comics industry
5923393 i would love to attend but how could i justify spending this kind of money at a time when taxes have been raised on our citizens at the worst possible time in our countrys history a time comparable to the great depression
5923394 ive had two people give me comments one said the timing could have been better
5923395 the interior department has announced a plan that would dramatically undercut the endangered species act our nations safety net for animals and plants on the brink of extinction if finalized the plan would allow government agencies with no formal wildlife expertise to decide the fate of imperiled species like the polar bear the gray wolf and whales even worse those agencies may have a pro polluter or pro development agenda that is directly at odds with the well being of wildlife
5923396 the bush administrations new rules which could go into effect in as little as 90 days unless congress acts to block them also address a loose end left by the interior departments decision in may to list the polar bear as threatened the reason for listing the bears was climate change global warming is melting their sea ice habitat but the proposed changes to the esa would explicitly exempt any action on warming based on the law in other words even though scientific opinion says that global warming will have a disastrous effect on wildlife the government wont be able to use the esa to do anything about reducing carbon emissions climate change is not an american problem it is an american and worldwide problem if the esa and other regulations are weak in the worlds largest economy the whole world is in very deep trouble to use the clich adage when the us sneezes the whole world catches a cold the us would be setting a bad example and other especially industrialized nations which emit most greenhouse gases will follow suit
5923397 as far as the winds we should have seen the worse of it
5923398 we had our strongest gust 54 mph about 10 minutes ago
5923399 some people would come and go at one point we had 33 people at woodlawn elementary alone
5923400 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5923401 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5923402 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5923403 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5923404 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5923405 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5923406 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5923407 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5923408 the milf cannot come to the negotiating table with its hands smeared by the blood of the innocents
5923409 grinding poverty in mindanao is the root cause of discontent in the region but every day that war rages in mindanao the farther we get away from peace
5923410 thats everything thats abominable in a civilized society more so since the government and the milf are already talking peace
5923411 the fighting has to stop we need food and medicine in mindanao not more death and destruction in its parched land of mindanao
5923412 i look forward to our training camp and then our match against uzbekistan which is when it all begins
5923413 this was a good chance a good opportunity to look at all the players for me
5923414 scott has good experience and has a good feel for space
5923415 he is also very comfotable on the ball im happy he could play 45 minutes and in september hell be ready for 90 minutes
5923416 every player wants to play in the world cup but first we have to concentrate on the qualifying games and scott wants to be there
5923417 benni knows how to hold the ball and how to bring the three midfielders in to the game
5923418 i hope he will be a regular over the next two years but football is always a surprise i wanted him for the previous games but it was not possible
5923419 south africa are similar to brazil in the way they play
5923420 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have for mr rudd
5923421 the recently concluded armm automated elections is a success the exercise was orderly and generally peaceful the voters were excited to try the high tech equipment in just a short while they were able to get the hang of it the teachers were happy too because they had less of a hard time since the voting process was quick
5923422 there are concerns to be addressed regarding the transmission we want the counting to do faster and we want transparency in it to know who are winning or losing the ideal scenario is that only the voter handles the ballot the less human intervention the more credible the elections would be
5923423 there is no policy institute or think tank better equipped to do a sensitive study on what acts of giving or philanthropic acts can best serve national economic goals than the ndcp
5923424 i am fully aware of how rigorous and scholarly the training at the ndcp is
5923425 economic development on the other hand is about what the late ka pepe diokno termed as jobs food freedoms it is the type of growth that enhances the quality of life that nurtures and protects the basic freedoms that raises the sense of dignity of the individual
5923426 regardless of motive and intent my personal take on the paper is this a paradigm shift is needed and the act of giving should move more and more into the direction of the initiatives of bill and melinda gates warren buffet ted turner and george soros
5923427 the act of giving should be directed toward alleviating much of the fundamental and basic ills of the world it should be life altering she said
5923428 the term limit the provision prohibiting an incumbent president gloria macapagal arroyo from running for reelection has not been revised it is still in place
5923429 in other words there is no intention that the senators and the members of the house who are term limited under the present constitution would be exempted from the coverage of the term limits and that includes me because my second consecutive senatorial term will end in 2010
5923430 if we do not define the agenda in the resolution the people would have every reason to suspect that we the members of congress have a hidden agenda by putting on record what we want changed in the constitution with specificity we put to rest that popular suspicion
5923431 its a case of putting the cart before the horse
5923432 if they know that charter change is needed to pave the way for federalism and for bangsamoro juridical entity bje they should have just directly batted for charter change
5923433 the government should have told the milf that these are the things needed before any of the ancestral domains get going
5923434 one need not be a lawyer just to know that there is really something wrong in the way the government puts its plan in action and here the peoples suspicion is that the government is moving high heavens to force charter change
5923435 what will happen next is that when similar moves are encountered in the near future then incumbent officials would now say there is a need for caretaker and that we need to extend the term something like that
5923436 international flights have historically been sacrosanct from these kinds of charges david stempler president of the air travelers association passenger advocacy group said
5923437 this is the new era of a fee for every service we should get used to it
5923438 gateway to europe with about 33 daily international flights food in first class will remain free
5923439 these changes are difficult but necessary and we do not make them lightly the chicago based airline said in a memo to employees
5923440 however they enable us to reduce costs and generate additional revenue while preserving a differentiated product for our premium cabin customers
5923441 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5923442 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on aug 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5923443 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5923444 the russian federation will not be able to support the draft resolution submitted by france today
5923445 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5923446 the georgian football federation has until aug 26 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of sept 6
5923447 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match
5923448 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
5923449 they have made a decision on that now and i think its important they have made that decision
5923450 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
5923451 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points
5923452 for both teams not only for us the first game is very very important
5923453 i have never wanted to win more than i do right here and i will but this is wayne krivskys team not walt jockettys and not mine i just hope there is enough out there after the season that we can get to help us
5923454 only more effective governance in armm is key to lasting peace in muslim mindanao
5923455 only peace negotiations and aggressive efforts at effective governance with concrete results in armm will bring about lasting peace and prosperity
5923456 the moa should not be forced down our throats the credibility of these peacepacts is now highly suspect with malacanang pressing for chacha along with it and the flawed exclusive process undertaken to have the agreement
5923457 to ease the tensions and regain lost momentum the moa should be renegotiated and efforts must focus on a constitional peacepact and not on chacha even their staunchest allies in the senate have expressed serious reservations against the mo its existing form is dead in the waters of the senate the way out is a renegotiated agreement and ensuring good governance in the armm
5923458 we have learned over the past several weeks how unaware the affected local governments and their people were to what the government peace panel was doing behind their backs
5923459 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain
5923460 the memorandum of agreement will result in a diminution of philippine sovereignty as it empowers its juridical creation to enter into economic agreements and trade relations with foreign countries to open trade missions abroad and to participate in meetings of the asean and un specialized agencies where only sovereign states take part
5923461 royce pacibe and rafi dimakuta won a gold medal in the third young inventors physics project olympiad held in sarajevo bosnia herzegovina for their project called crystal radio
5923462 the same invention won them another gold medal in the second international competition held in tbilisi georgia
5923463 these two students were also awarded a bronze medal in the first yunepo yunus emre invitation for love and peace international project olympiad conducted at eskisehir a university town west of ankara turkey
5923464 practically all aspects of life have changed because of ict work school in how we communicate how we do business and even the way we think
5923465 for instance the digital village project which will enable rural farmers to use the internet to access information on prices of goods land records weather forecasts local government database and other agricultural knowledge support thereby boosting their agriculture productivity has been dragging on for years
5923466 the strategic importance of ict to national development and global competitiveness is undeniable it is instrumental to creating jobs improving government services empowering the poor and improving the quality of life of all filipinos
5923467 the lenovo s10 left a good taste in my mouth i walked away from my 45 minutes alone with it only wanting more time with it the solid manufacturing quality along with its spacious keyboard indicate that as a piece of hardware the s10 is one of the best however it is too early to make a call on the s10 until we see some solid benchmarks and battery life scores
5923468 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined
5923469 the concern we harbor now about malaca angs backing for a resolution for a shift to federalism has nothing to do with our principles but our concern has a lot to do with malaca angs track record of political maneuvers
5923470 its been part of their plan all along thats been their plan since 2004 especially when the hello garci controversy broke out they have been working to amend the charter not to improve our economic provisions but for political considerations
5923471 the people wont allow it neither will the senate or congress during the so many times they attempted to amend the charter the people had spoken
5923472 the red cross emblem is an internationally recognized emblem purposely used to protect humanitarian workers vehicles and medical facilities in times of armed conflict and violence and to identify the members of the red cross movement
5923473 the term limit the provision prohibiting an incumbent president gloria macapagal arroyo from running for reelection has not been revised it is still in place
5923474 in other words there is no intention that the senators and the members of the house who are term limited under the present constitution would be exempted from the coverage of the term limits and that includes me because my second consecutive senatorial term will end in 2010
5923475 if we do not define the agenda in the resolution the people would have every reason to suspect that we the members of congress have a hidden agenda by putting on record what we want changed in the constitution with specificity we put to rest that popular suspicion
5923476 kasama natin ang mga taga mindanao at nagkakaisa ang bayan laban dito sa kataksilan sa ating bansa na pinakita ng gobyerno lumalabag sa konstitusyon itong moa at hanggang sa ngayon hindi pa rin natin alam kung ano ang kabutihan na maidudulot nito
5923477 sinasabi ng ating gobyerno na hindi pa done deal itong moa magkakaroon pa raw ng plebisito pero makikita natin na hindi dumaan ito sa konsultasyon at kung anuman ang pinagkasundo ng milf at ng gobyerno sisikapin na itong iimplementa na walang konsiderasyon sa interes ng mamamayan sa mindanao at sa buong pilipinas
5923478 must be made aware of and be committed to the observance of international humanitarian law while international humanitarian law does not prevent wars and armed conflict it does help reduce the inherently terrible effects of war on combatants and non combatants alike
5923479 international humanitarian law essentially brings a humane element into conflicts when observed it makes sure that mercy compassion and justice are extended to those directly engaged in combat and especially toward non combatants who need protection from the effects of war
5923480 at this very moment some 130 000 refugees are fleeing war torn areas in north cotabato the philippine armed forces as well as the milf are both bound under international humanitarian law to protect non combatants caught in the conflict and to treat combatants from either side humanely even in war combatants especially those injured and no longer capable of fighting still have rights and must not be denied humanitarian treatment
5923481 the founder of the red cross businessman henry dunant in the nineteenth century laid the foundation and planted the seed for international humanitarian law when he spontaneously helped the wounded soldiers and civilians in the battle of solferino in italy
5923482 like many of us today dunant was busy with his own life conducting his own business and had no advanced plans to be a hero
5923483 it was henry dunant who later wrote a book about his experiences helping combatants and civilians in solferino who became the inspiration for the creation of the international committee of the red cross or icrc in 1863
5923484 it was true then and it is true today the red cross and its various societies around the world exist to extend protection succor and humanitarian aid to undertake compassionate action for the sake of those suffering the effects of war as well as other man made and natural disasters
5923485 its no exaggeration to say that without the red cross the icrc there might be no international humanitarian law today thats because the knowledge experience and spirit of the red cross became the foundation for the creation of international humanitarian law
5923486 we have to exhaust all resources possible and give the people a forum to understand the traitorous nature of this moa while in theory creating a bje bangsamoro juridical entity has no legal basis whatsoever this does not matter to a government that has shown no regard for the law of the land itself and is forcing its people to accept a deal that is disadvantageous to all filipinos
5923487 kailangang matigil ang katraydurang ito ide depensa natin ang ating saligang batas our constitution is not just a piece of paper it is our nations very substance and spirit
5923488 sa moa na ito at sa iba pang mga kasunduang papasukin ng gobyerno ang importante ay dumaan ito sa tamang proseso at pagkonsulta sa mga mamamayan kailangan nating malaman kung paano nakaabot ang moa sa puntong ito para hindi mangyari uli ito
5923489 ang pumipirma sa moa ay pumipirma for and in behalf of the republic of the philippines ibig sabihin kino commit iyan ng ating gobyerno na maisakatuparan ang moa na iyan at sisikapin niya ang lahat upang maimplementa ang probisyon ng moa tama ba naman iyan kinonsulta ba tayo ng gobyerno natin
5923490 women and children are always the most vulnerable sectors in armed conflict situations the government should make sure they are given priority attention in evacuation relief and rehabilitation efforts
5923491 there can be no justification for the dastardly acts the government must move swiftly to restore order in these areas and bring to justice the armed groups who perpetrated these attacks
5923492 the thing that impressed me the most over the past couple of days is micahs attitude which has been great he is talent we have to nurture
5923493 there has been speculation that when players drop down they wont be motivated to play for the under 21s but that has not been the case with micah at all
5923494 players have to be able to step up and step down they do it abroad and we have to get into that mentality of doing it here
5923495 and that will serve micah in good stead he cant be in the wilderness of not being in the seniors and not be in the under 21s and be in between the two squads
5923496 this is what we are trying to build towards players coming to the under 21 side and seeing it as a pathway back to the senior squad
5923497 national societies disseminate and assist their governments in disseminating ihl they take initiatives in this respect they should propose that an interdepartmental committee be formed in their country composed of government representatives and representatives of the red cross to evolve and implement adequate means to the systematic dissemination of the geneva conventions in the armed forces universities among young people and also to the civilian population
5923498 as national societies our role is to assist the government in the promotion of the geneva conventions thus after this forum we should have gained new ideas and tools we can bring back to our respective countries speaking of cooperation this is really the essence of why we are here to share our experiences and see how we can best work together the ns and the icrc and the ns between themselves to develop the promotion of ihl and in particular the geneva conventions
5923499 the people simply do not trust that the arroyo government is capable of pursuing any noble act everyone can see through its selfish motive to reconsolidate support in mindanao after the moa ad fiasco and at the same time hold on to power beyond 2010 by claiming support from the federalism initiative in the senate
5923500 now the arroyo government is calling for federalism as the solution to the peace problem in mindanao but who can trust a two faced government that offers false peace and readily sows war at the same time
5923501 after all the chaos it has caused wheres the accountability now who will own up for fomenting confusion and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians
5923502 quickly defeat the trickster and his underlings and keep your frontline allies safe
5923503 swiftly assist your allied sorcery and defeat all famous enemy generals
5923504 swiftly complete the mission and defeat the enemy sorcerer and underlings
5923505 they zamboanga and iligan city have rejected their inclusion into the armm we should respect their sovereign expression
5923506 thus they government panel should explain why this is so when in fact these areas have rejected their inclusion in the plebiscite
5923507 terrorists are operating in kerala but their main activities are outside the state when we took police action against some of them there was a hue and cry from human rights activists saying that minorities were being targeted
5923508 the afp should change its defensive and reactive stance such that it responds only after the milf attacks i hope that at this time the afp and pnp would have planned an offensive to uproot and destroy once and for all the military infrastructure of the milf if not degrade their military capability
5923509 if the afp needs a supplemental budget from congress it is proper that we should grant their request however they must explain well not only how they will use the funds but also how they used their past funding
5923510 because of the expressed support by malacanang and the statements coming out from the proponents in the house of representatives a lot of slippery and winding roads loom ahead that pose danger to the charter change move
5923511 many of those who signed resolution no 10 signed not because of positive support to the proposed amendments to the charter but was an expression of desire to put the issue to extensive public consultation and debate so that the public may be informed on the nature of this constitutional move to amend the charter the public needs to be informed on the advantages and disadvantages of a federal system of government so that when the public is finally called upon to render a judgment on plebiscite day they are well informed
5923512 but because of the expressed desire of malacanang and its supporters in the house of representatives the previous negative reception to the idea of charter change has been resurrected
5923513 it is therefore not surprising that senators who had affixed their signatures to the resolution no 10 of senator pimentel may be withdrawing
5923514 i am withdrawing my signature and will only affix my signature when i see that the slippery winding road is already paved safely
5923515 to resolve a bloody moro war for self rule in mindanao
5923516 dont pass the blame for your failure in mindanao sec dureza for a government who flaunts support for peace in mindanao but who in itself derails the process by a muddled policy and road map as the bungled moa ad on bje would show you dont need to look far than yourselves to see how fractured your peace plan is
5923517 it was not even mentioned in her sona now suddenly here is a public confession on her preference for federalism the motive is high suspect
5923518 by their own admission the palace inadvertently said the moa ad rests on shaky assumptions and presumptions if one excuse for their sudden shift to federalism is to resolve the mindanao conflict then it is tantamount to them professing the unconstitutionality of the moa ad
5923519 pgma cannot just decide on a day to day affair she ought to have a genuine will to provide a durable political solution to mindanao and she can start with providing a clear road map towards peace in mindanao so that we can follow each step
5923520 when i signed senate joint resolution number 10 pushing for federalism my signature was with clear reservations as to timing and provisions to be amended
5923521 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5923522 when i became convinced that the universe is natural that all the ghosts and gods are myths there entered into my brain into my soul into every drop of my blood the sense the feeling the joy of freedom
5923523 even if the federalism proposal is adopted today we cannot say it will take effect immediately it will take time to restructure the government and put in place the federal system it cannot be done under the present term of the president
5923524 if i will have the way we should now debate and decide on resolution 10 because im still here and as long as i am here i will not allow any attempt to use the federalism proposal to push for a hidden political agenda
5923525 but if my colleagues want it to take effect after the term of president arroyo why not
5923526 this is just to kind of stop some of the whining going on i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab looks like were already in the rumor mill

5923555 hey dustyn i have two questions for you can i ask you them
5923556 is desmond mad at me because lately he has been a little um curt near me
5923557 he is just mad because i am hanging out with you
5923558 hey dustyn who is sicarius erus and well what are the capios
5923559 nothing oh their just uh random witches and wizards you dont need to know
5923560 she has the right to know who her great grandfather is
5923561 okay sicarius erus was a cruel malicious wizard actually let me start earlier he was a very sweet man he donated to underprivileged witches and wizards and helped them create a home and feed themselves and he used to fly witches across the sky the he said he found the key to everything he hated mortals and anyone who helped them he only liked witches and wizards and he had a reason to hate some mortals because both of his parents were killed when a bomb took place in their house you see sicarius eruss real name is well no one likes to refer to him as it afraid the name is cursed and will automatically kill you ill write it down
5923562 he used a spell that was proof of his power he went against the vindicatio lam ia and created an evil spell with his newly reformed powers tru cido
5923563 is a very awful curse that makes sure that everyone would make him the lord of all wizards it cruelly and slowly killed someone so painfully that even the most evil person in the world would feel bad about casting it he became extremely non powerful when destinys grandfather almost killed him with the same curse he had the blood of the evil lord and there forth the curse would work for him and his relatives the v l vindicatio lam ia prohibited it unless the wizard or witch had to protect itself in the matter of life and death destinys grandfather saved us all and well the rumors say that when you were four you also helped he came back and you and destinys grandfather killed him for the last time he was dead and hopefully he never reappears the capios are the followers of the evil lord and help find ways to kill mortals or anyone who tries to stop them they are the center of evil but they have to keep their word or sicarius eruss spell will backfire and kill them i want you to have nothing to do with them they are so evil that they kill mortals for fun in their free time they have tried to kill desmond on numerous occasions and now they are under strict limits they can only use some spells on mortals and the baleti no family twins we cannot take any chances now that they know you are here with them they will try there hardest to kill you and them all they will stop at nothing to find you and kill you
5923564 the farc made themselves into criminals a long time ago
5923565 we are simply tired of this i e farcs violence
5923566 we have in fact put considerable emphasis on how al qaeda in iraq generates resources and they do it again like a mafia does that we would be familiar with its through extortion of successful businesses extortion of money for protection rackets or what have you insisting that a cell phone business for example give them a cut of their profits or theyll blow the cell phones down cell phone towers down taking a cut out of the cement business the real estate business the financial businesses and so forth
5923567 their extortion campaign demanding that businesses pay protection money to avoid being attacked
5923568 to control cell phone use has quickly evolved into just another extortion campaign
5923569 the cell phone service in order to stay in touch with friends family and the few government services that are available
5923570 demanded that night service be restored it was but then noting that there were several cell phone companies operating in southern afghanistan the taliban went to the different companies and offered not only protection but damage to a competitor for a price

5923573 i spent three days as a juror in a case in which it seemed obvious early on that no conviction could possibly result
5923574 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and pushed her onto their bed the defendant claimed he held her arms to keep her from hitting him with a phone the next day the woman phoned police and the district attorneys office asking that her fianc not be prosecuted
5923575 she stated that she had overreacted and that she would do anything she could to stop the prosecution nonetheless the case proceeded
5923576 the only other witness the prosecution had was a policeman who had heard the womans original complaint part of his testimony was contradicted by facts that could be ascertained from the 911 recording in the jury room some of us speculated about why this case had ever been brought to court

5923588 there was no significant difference in mean calories purchased by patrons reporting seeing but not using calorie information and patrons who reported not seeing calorie information
5923589 theres still the issue of the consumers right to know
5923590 and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5923591 erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront evil when we see it

5923593 weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years and abortions have not gone down
5923594 its cheaper than producing it here at home a governmental war on energy imports will by definition
5923595 i have set before the american people an energy plan the lexington project named for the town where americans asserted their independence once before
5923596 there was some literature put out by the national right to life committee and theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill
5923597 well and because they have not been telling the truth
5923598 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
5923599 cest parti vite et j tais d j derri re au d part je narrivais pas tenir par les pieds
5923600 i was utterly amazed to see the board might could use a little guidance in a recent editorial might could use what english grammar book did that come from shame on you your arkie background is showing

5923605 you are a girl but i feel you have bloodthirstiness sorry sorry
5923606 yeah oh well i havent killed anyone yet so dont worry about it
5923607 were going to have a tstorm the wind is going to kick up a bit so put a few rocks on the patio furniture so you dont have to chase it all over the neighborhood it will probably hail a little and oh yeah theres the possiblity of a bit of rotation so we could have a tornado so be aware that you should be prepared to head for the cellar and now back to law and order
5923608 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5923609 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports
5923610 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5923611 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5923612 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland
5923613 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south

5923616 these acquisitions reinforce our policy of operating a young fleet that provides more passenger comfort in our quest for tam service excellence
5923617 the inclusion of palawan in the proposed moa is in total disregard and clearly in violation of the palawe o peoples will expressed overwhelmingly in four plebiscites in the past 30 years rejecting palawans integration with the muslim mindanao region
5923618 the creation of the so called bangsa moro juridical entity is in violation of the constitution because this further creates a state within the island of mindanao including the parts of palawan the municipalities of bataraza and balabac
5923619 we were treated by this administration like animals to be given away just like that as a muslim leader even i was only informed about it moa through the media
5923620 and certainly as i have gone around the south this past few weeks i have yet to find anyone who is in favor of including portions of palawan in the expanded armm
5923621 cloud seeding is a relatively well known practice that involves shooting various substances into clouds such as silver iodide salts and dry ice that bring on the formation of larger raindrops triggering a downpour
5923622 but chinese scientists believe they have perfected a technique that reduces the size of the raindrops delaying the rain until the clouds move on
5923623 its a bold and according to international scientists dubious bit of stage managing
5923624 we may rightly be suspicious of theologies of reconciliation that promote christian unity at the price of political silence
5923625 the hermeneutic circle makes it incumbent upon interpreters to state preconceptions and concerns openly where they can be seen and critiqued not only by other interpreters but by the gospel itself
5923626 but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood condemned for before certain men came from james he was eating with the gentiles but when they came he drew back and separated himself fearing the circumcision party
5923627 the lord your god will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul and live
5923628 circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by christ
5923629 my dear children for whom i am again in the pains of childbirth until christ is formed in you
5923630 prodigal sons and daughters do not threaten our christian identity except to the extent that they may tempt us to respond to them by surrendering ourselves to idolatry
5923631 to enjoy something is to cling to it with love for its own sake
5923632 those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires
5923633 the eschatological fate of this man after undergoing discipline and repentance will be salvation
5923634 the punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him now instead you ought to forgive and comfort him so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow i urge you therefore to reaffirm your love for him
5923635 persist in the very activities from which they have been freed through the sacrifice of the paschal lamb
5923636 we are not to associate or even share a non eucharistic meal with someone who claims to be in christ but who lives a notoriously evil life
5923637 but those guys in particular have worked really hard this season as far as im concerned we have the best pitching staff in the league and theyre a very big reason why
5923638 im having a decent season but i wasnt expecting to be anywhere
5923639 i just barely started in the rotation im excited to be there and its a great opportunity to show people what i have
5923640 this is something i never would have thought about before i was surprised because there are a lot of guys playing well right now
5923641 wow it looked pretty ominous up your way last night looked like you were getting some rain we sat out on the deck most of the evening it was pretty nice
5923642 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
5923643 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
5923644 ive had a lot of water and now its just time to relax a little bit
5923645 i went out on the first night and thats probably going to be enough for me
5923646 is there anything we can do for you for you are the one in trouble now
5923647 abs 56 has been moving large amounts of weight around initially mostly my own
5923648 the simplest and most necessary truths are often the last believed
5923649 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5923650 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5923651 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5923652 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5923653 i live every day in fear that gorbachev will be replaced by a stalinist type figure
5923654 no i wanted to i dont know what i wanted
5923655 im fairly certain that all my permits are up to date and the yearly inspection of the manor was only two months ago
5923656 eeylops sent me im looking for an owl this is your place
5923657 hermione and ron bought me an owl for my birthday only i didnt quite connect with him i took him back to eeylops and tried three others
5923658 why my owls arent good enough for the chosen one
5923659 what is your problem i came because eeylops thought that i might do better with a newly trained owl that had never been owned before he didnt have any and thought that you might but obviously im wasting my time
5923660 well you are wasting your time all my owls are newly hatched except for my breeding pairs
5923661 i should have around ten owls available in the late fall and a few more in the winter
5923662 i havent had an owl since hedwig she died in the war she saved my life
5923663 after the war ron and hermione lived with me i borrowed their owls whenever i needed one sometimes i used ginnys but that was back when we were dating i live alone now and ron and hermione thought it was time
5923664 think youre pretty smart eh romeo id say youve got your signals crossed
5923665 yes his name is romeo and he is an utter slut
5923666 hes a boreal owl sometimes theyre called tengmalms loyal birds theyre fairly uncommon but can be bred easily
5923667 tried three different boreal females before i gave up i have two pairs with broods right now hes the resident babysitter he stays for the free food
5923668 i suppose i should go sorry to take up your time
5923669 opportunistic whelp youre smarter than i gave you credit death eater to savior of the universe in one swoop
5923670 he wants to go with you potter are you that daft dont answer that
5923671 he moved in on his own accord after the war i tried to send him back to his original owner but had no luck perhaps they anyway his freeloading days are over hes decided to take you up on your job offer
5923672 dont need your money potter goodbye romeo have a nice life
5923673 if it doesnt work out can i send him back
5923674 off you go dont let the door hit you on the way out
5923675 i doubt you do but feel free to apparate at will ive got work to do
5923676 i suppose not must be nice being the beloved pet of the most famous wizard in the world i bet people give you whole mice for flying three blocks
5923677 hello potter a group of owls is called a parliament
5923678 hi sorry didnt mean to startle you parliament sounds pretty muggle
5923679 where do you think they got the term the wizengamot was created almost three hundred years before the muggle kings took up the idea you didnt think they came up with it out of thin air did you
5923680 do you even know what the first muggle parliament was called
5923681 umm no i didnt learn too much history before i went to hogwarts
5923682 well it was called a witenagemot coincidence muggles have been stealing all our best ideas and passing them off as their own for centuries
5923683 wow i dont think i ever really thought about it
5923684 i can just imagine the things you think are muggle invented
5923685 probably for the best you said that you wanted to learn about owl breeding what would you like to know
5923686 thats because your pal of a giant oaf was teaching care of
5923687 they make mating calls or greetings they can get really loud if they need to defend their territory but owls in captivity rarely get into such scuffles they give warnings and sometimes whistle
5923688 i currently have twenty breeding pairs of eleven different species
5923689 do you have to do a spell when theyre born to make them deliver the mail
5923690 no i suppose i couldve done some reading im sure hermione would have found me fifty books if id asked
5923691 i guess im just really curious as to how you became an owl breeder sorry
5923692 the hutches are charmed to banish excrement and debris twice a day as is the floor of the hangar
5923693 i agreed to tell you about the owls anything personal i think we should leave off limits
5923694 is this some sort of auror assignment to check up on me
5923695 it seemed like you knew a lot so i imagined i could learn something and try to thank you for romeo at the same time hes been very good company
5923696 all right lesson number one owls are born magical not all species but most of the common ones and then some
5923697 no theyre either born with ability to see magic and wizards or they arent but it is passed to the next generation and magic owls have been bred in captivity for centuries
5923698 but a magic owl could be born to non magic owls
5923699 yes potter theoretically a magical owl could be born in the wild to non magical owls but it probably wouldnt seek out a wizard of its own accord it would remain on its own out in the wild they need to be hand reared to be tame and taught to recognize wizards and deliver mail
5923700 no their parents do i just help out a little
5923701 once they reach about this size and maturity they attempt flight here in the hangar once theyre strong enough their parents will accompany them on their first flight outside ill start sending one of the parents on short mail flights the first few will usually be just to the manor the fledgling will accompany them then the flights become farther and farther and eventually ill send the young owl on its own
5923702 how long does it take for them to be fully trained
5923703 depends on the breed but usually between two to four months
5923704 they dont need to the theory is that once the fledgling learns the behavior from the parent the magic takes over and they inherently know how to locate the wizard our names and address become magical signatures to them no one is truly sure how the owls know but they do
5923705 could an owl be trained to fly somewhere instead of its mail destination
5923706 as in fly to a location or wizard first and then be set off to deliver the mail
5923707 i dont think so no ones ever successfully been able to put a tracking spell on an owl either they have their own inherent magic that is practically resistant to ours
5923708 you pretty much have to physically intercept an owl to keep it from its destination whats with the cloak and dagger potter
5923709 nothing secretive i told you that weve had some issues in mle we think thereve been a few owls intercepted but we cant find a trace of anything im only trying to learn what i can
5923710 but then i wouldnt get to see it in action im more of a hands on kind of learner
5923711 i bought them from stores or other breeders usually the owls in captivity readily pair up but sometimes it takes a few matches to get it right
5923712 once paired they usually stay together indefinitely extremely monogamous creatures owls
5923713 i provide the nesting boxes and they settle right in owls are opportunistic nesters there are usually some mating songs a bit of wing flapping the obligatory gifts of dead rodents and bugs from the male to the female and then voila
5923714 i imagined youd have a brood of red headed imps by now
5923715 almost owls in captivity are still inclined to breed in the spring but many pairs will start a new brood whenever the last lot has left the nest so i tend to have a pair or two breeding at some point throughout the year summer is still my busiest season with new chicks and fledglings
5923716 you mentioned that you would have some ready to leave the nest late fall
5923717 is that your subtle way of asking if id like to join you for dinner now
5923718 im not much for subtle did you have a place in mind or would you like me to choose
5923719 mother is extremely particular about her wine my adolescence was complete with lessons to ensure that i could select the proper vintage with any meal
5923720 came in handy at all the death eater ritual sacrifices and orgies
5923721 oh yes merlot makes a sublime accompaniment to human sacrifice
5923722 it was horrific to this day i still have nightmares my memories are filled with blood curdling visions of the bowels of human nature if i couldnt joke about it id be in the blast ended skrewts for brains ward at st mungos
5923723 i like it fine good days and bad days like everyone i suppose but i cant imagine doing anything else how do you like being an owl breeder
5923724 lets put it this way i enjoy being around owls far more than people
5923725 when i first found out about your breeding business i couldnt for the life of me imagine you working with animals
5923726 not animals owls and ill have you know breeding magical owls is a time honored and noble wizarding tradition
5923727 see its all starting to make sense now you get along with the owls better than people
5923728 not in the least malfoy ive thought a lot of things about you but never once did i think you were simple
5923729 i had a cottage built not far from the hangar about two years ago living with my parents wasnt conducive to having a healthy social life
5923730 i guess it made it hard to bring girls home
5923731 you should stop doing that youre wasting a fine vintage
5923732 yes well you should also know that my preference in men goes beyond a preference in wizards
5923733 its not like there are a lot of gay wizards thereve been half bloods among my paramours
5923734 ive always assumed he gravitates to those who fly for the same team
5923735 not that ive seen oh i think hed shag another bird if he could but i dont think he ever has im guessing romeos quite the anomaly
5923736 we crossed that line right after the wine was poured
5923737 perhaps im thinking it would explain a lot about your failure to marry the she weasel y
5923738 fine were back off the personal life tell me more about this owl issue at the ministry
5923739 i had a case that umm the only way the person we were tracking couldve been alerted was if one of our ministry owls was intercepted
5923740 yes we looked at that and even set up a trap it had to have been the owl only we cant figure out how and then it happened a second time with a different owl
5923741 well we traced the owls both were from eeylops one from a breeder clarion
5923742 and the other owl came from a very sweet old witch who had died at the ripe old age of 127
5923743 no suspicious owners or traders nothing to make us think that the owls were planted in the ministry nothing suspicious at all

5923833 our goal is to provide families a musical outlet in an environment where their kids will be valued challenged and encouraged and come away with a love of music
5923834 they used basic lessons to teach them the elements of music and they experienced music in a way that helped them really appreciate it the instructors expectations were high but achievable so the kids had a real sense of accomplishment
5923835 we took him to piano lessons but he just went because we took him he never really showed interest until vivo he was excited to go interested in his homework and he really wanted to do well
5923836 part of the challenge is to come up with new and different methods of presenting information
5923837 there are a number of social emotional and physical challenges with any student so you have to tailor your classroom for the student
5923838 i remember one day they had the students listen to the rhythm of their heartbeats with a stethoscope and it really clicked with justin

5923849 i am an animal lover theres one feral cat that loves my backyard that looks very ill is skinny and losing hair and its very sad what am i supposed to do were not really sure the best way to handle it
5923850 we fine dog owners if someone reports a dog owner has not picked up after them were trying to find a way to please residents who have complained about the cat issue too
5923851 people here are so outraged they are just letting their cats stay outside the people that have instituted this rule theyve only lived here for around two years in other words they like dogs but they dont like cats
5923852 he doesnt bother anybody he stays on the porch and he comes in to be fed three times a day most of the cats out there stay close to their owners homes and they dont bother anybody theyre punishing everybody for pets where their owners dont adhere to the rules
5923853 its not like they bark i dont understand what the problem is if they can give me a good reason for this then i will listen

5923902 as of yet we dont know what those big growth areas in cloud are going to be
5923903 we would expect that categories such as servers would be hit from the point of view of ownership inside the enterprises in favour of significant growth by big service providers

5923988 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using seven year old yang peiyis voice
5923989 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first

5923993 one thing about our pitching staff for a good while now theyve given us the chance to win games on a continual basis
5923994 the thing about him is hell throw 88 mph 89 90 and then when he gets to two strikes he can pump it up to 94 or 96
5923995 thats as well as hes thrown the ball since early in the year
5923996 i was looking behind my shoulder and he was freezing thats why i went to first it was a tough play
5923997 i just followed the third baseman down the line and i was pretty far down and whenever he let go of the ball i thought it was going to be a cruise

5924062 unfortunately we dont have bible pathway in vietnamese we are looking for a translator for that
5924063 we can ship into those countries i feel like we need to step into that door and meet the needs there this could be a very fruitful field for christ
5924064 we shouldnt be focusing every four years on whether we want to get on the platform

5924079 even christians in pakistan are somewhat mixed in their response there are those that are quite glad to see a return to civilian government and there are others that are also concerned with i think the uncertainty of what is going to happen now for the future
5924080 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5924081 i believe that all of the answers to every problem or crisis that we have can be found in gods word and through his son jesus and that is what people learn when they are able to access the truth of the gospel
5924082 historically under the former soviet union literacy was very high but it was primarily russian that was taught in the schools and since the break up of the former soviet union theres been more of a nationalistic fervor to teach the national language georgian and ossetia in the schools
5924083 georgian and ossetian are the language of their heart the languages they speak in their homes and the language they would pray to god in so when we provide them the audio bible in their heart language that opens up the word of god in a whole new way
5924084 to provide a digital proclaimer unit is 157 50 that provides the unit the shipping the customs duties and the cost of the local transportation to get it in the hands of the churches
5924085 we never went out during the time we were training
5924086 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5924087 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
5924088 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5924089 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
5924090 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5924091 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5924092 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5924093 thats bmx it can be unpredictable i dont exactly what happened well have to look at the videos
5924094 id love to throw it 96 or 97 but i definitely dont i dont have a slider like joe nathan
5924095 but the twins are huge proponents of location over velocity and im always making a big point of that if you keep the ball low 92 looks a lot harder than 97 at the belt
5924096 these are the games we need to win playing a team thats struggling a little bit this year
5924097 the whole goal coming into a season is to win as many series as you can and we obviously havent been doing a good job of that for whatever reason we can get that final game to win a series
5924098 we came out and hit the ball pretty good tonight
5924099 the bullpen was really thin and we needed him to go out and give us four or five innings
5924100 i just felt like i didnt have anything in my arm
5924101 the ball felt like a feather i just didnt feel like i had anything behind it
5924102 for decades the human remains of thousands of native americans were lodged in federal repositories museums and scientific institutions
5924103 it required an act of the congress to ensure that their loved ones are accorded the proper respect in death that they enjoyed in life
5924104 makah people have always lived in this area and over the past 150 years a lot of our important cultural items have been improperly removed from here and are located in museums throughout the country
5924105 nagpra gave hope to all indian people that we could legally seek return of our cultural objects and for many this promise has been realized if we had the resources we would make a bigger push to bring our objects home where they belong

5924107 since the government has been insensitive to our long pending demand we are constrained to go for a strike
5924108 now that the medal slipped through akhils fingers the best way we can console him is by winning medals ourselves in his absence the expectation is on us and we will give our best
5924109 as i have been telling akhil is everything for me i was completely shattered by his defeat and even his persuasion could not lift my spirit
5924110 wherever i am its all because of him he was just unfortunate to lose the battle and i want to make him feel better and i want to win only for him
5924111 i have not fought gongora earlier and hence its a tricky situation i have seen his recordings and preparing accordingly he is of my height and is a tricky customer so its going to be a no holds barred bout
5924112 so many world champions and olympic champions have been upstaged you just cannot take things for granted
5924113 ill be making a recommendation to not do a burlingame construction bond on the november ballot
5924114 it is something we are going to have to watch
5924115 if its something that is not growing we are going to have to revisit endeavor its comparatively safer than the other stents and thats good
5924116 if im not mistaken there was an improvement on quality of life from stents if not a survival benefit at a certain price point that is worth doing
5924117 on the whole the broad med tech market continues to show solid growth particularly when compared to other segments of the economy
5924118 we think the market is stable and kind of growing in the range we indicated before
5924119 although medtronics fiscal first quarter is generally the weakest of the year medtronic reported a strong quarter of earnings per share outperformance largely driven by the highest gross margins the company has delivered since mid fiscal first quarter 2005
5924120 one concern in the quarter could be weaker than expected u s endeavor sales
5924121 power control unit which is an integrated microcontroller which only works on power management
5924122 turbo mode requires no operating system intervention it is fully detected and managed by the hardware if it has detected an idle core it is able to reallocate that power budget to the other cores

5924140 your vocabulary is mean and impoverished but entirely adequate to express your thoughts
5924141 george washington was the first president of the united states
5924142 on what basis can such claims be made and how can they be tested if not by the methods of science
5924143 i was just in the right place at the right time
5924144 theres no its over on this team the guys did a great job
5924145 each one of these guys has played the most significant role of any of the guys who have walked on our team
5924146 i think this is a message to all guys that want to walk on we try to reinforce positive performance guys that become contributors to our team in any way shape of form we certainly like to put them on scholarship when scholarships are available we are happy and pleased that we were able to reward these guys for their effort and contribution to the team
5924147 alfred had a really good spring as a defensive lineman
5924148 i think anytime we do this it really is a positive for a guy we see him as one of the guys that may be in the top 50 or 60 guys on our team he wasnt working into the two deep and having a role on defense so this is strictly experimental because we think he is a good athlete and a good player and he could contribute to the team someplace
5924149 mccullough has explosive quickness good one step quickness and he plays with power
5924150 mike mccoy and julio jones have probably played the most consistently
5924151 maybe you ought to ask the guy who leaked them out i think he could answer that question for you
5924152 it is no big deal i dont think that is something we want to do that is why we close practice so the other team cant see us we got on the internet to see if we could see any of clemsons plays from their scrimmage and we didnt see any im not pleased about it and it wont happen again
5924153 i was encouraged by the scrimmage after watching the film of the scrimmage
5924154 i think we were more aggressive we played more physical on both sides of the ball we showed a lot more toughness we made some big plays on offense which is a good thing obviously defensively you dont like to give them up i was pretty pleased overall with effort and intensity and the improvement we made from the first scrimmage to the second scrimmage
5924155 i think thats the most important thing and the improvement of a lot of the younger players
5924156 we are not disappointed at all with where we are right now but we certainly recognize the fact that we have a lot of things we can improve on todays practice and tomorrows practice will be kind of dedicated to try and to improve on the fundamental things we need to do to get better and some of things that we havent been able to practice enough on and then thursday we will probably center our focus more toward the first game
5924157 our study clearly shows that some of the research that is being done on bears comes at a cost to the animal
5924158 i know some scientists arent going to like it but i think its time that they and animal care organizations start reconsidering the kind of guidelines we currently use in the capturing and handling of all animals not just bears we also need government to support research that minimize the effects of capture
5924159 i think that a number of things can be done to perhaps minimize restraint times and capture related injuries
5924160 both legitimate with the irs does that mean id be considered spam or in violation of the forum rules
5924161 in terms of the governors race if rossi finishes 5 percentage points back hes toast there is no way he is going to recover gregoire is going to get huge amounts of money shell have a huge amount of momentum
5924162 voters are going to say wow he spent all this money biaw spent all this money that shows how important it was for him to do really well hell be toast he wont win
5924163 well then its going to be one of those close races
5924164 if its all within a couple points i dont think it has much significance
5924165 thats the way that district is and thats the way its going to be if she beats him by a couple of percentage points its hugely significant
5924166 even though this is a good turnout that basically will be driven by the party faithful this is an unbelievable ticket splitting kind of state one cant dismiss it as being like a large caucus its a mini general election
5924167 it does not seem to have had much predictive ability
5924168 a republican hasnt finished in the lead position in a gubernatorial primary in more than 30 years even though we won two of those elections in november with evans in 1976 and spellman in 1980
5924169 i think that is a stunningly good result for dino given the 34 percent he got four years ago in the primary
5924170 i dont know if thats the right answer or not
5924171 is finishing better than the 34 percent that he got last time the right answer i dont know i just know that if he comes anywhere close ill be satisfied
5924172 and there are some people like donors who will look at the primary
5924173 there is that balancing act between saving as much as you can and this desire to have what is considered to be a respectable showing in the primary
5924174 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
5924175 if youre going to dis me at least get some new material ive seen this one before youre not even any good at it
5924176 in order to learn the role of protein synthesis in early development of the sea urchin newly fertilized embryos were pulse labeled with tritiated leucine to provide a time course of changes in synthetic rate as measured by total counts per minute cpm

5924178 135 microliters of sample one was diluted with 330 microliters of buffer to make the protein concentration 2 mg ml
5924179 doofus in a 1989 survey found that anemia in basset hounds was correlated with advanced age anemia is a condition in which there is insufficient hemoglobin in the blood
5924180 there is only one way to cut taxes and to keep them going down and that is to keep this conservative government in office
5924181 canada is strong canada is independent and canada is back
5924182 it is not an environmental policy it is a tax increase disguised as an environmental policy
5924183 youll never know what can happen but the official election date is october 2009

5924185 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5924186 in the merchant business our wholesale electricity performed extremely well and the wholesale gas business continues to be robust
5924187 were on budget and ahead of schedule with respect of the renewable portfolio both wind and hydro that were developing
5924188 and we have a growing contribution from our coal seam gas interests
5924189 revenues were down operating costs were up and interest costs were up so all of the key metrics were in the wrong direction
5924190 as a consequence there was an ebit reduction of 34 million from 46 6 million down to 12 4 million
5924191 we said we would strengthen the balance sheet we have

5924200 genuinely cares about the problems of people like me we appreciate his continued trips to montana to let us know that we are not forgotten
5924201 senator mccain has become a strong supporter of the bush policies policies which have led to disaster both at home and abroad
5924202 this is everyman he is kansan and he is kenyan he is african and he is anglo american he is common sense and he is eloquence he is dynamic and he is down to earth
5924203 barack obama has inspired me to believe in politics again and most importantly the power of the ordinary citizen
5924204 although i still identify as a republican and still stand for some conservative values i finally feel like america has found a leader it can look up to and trust
5924205 the link between our countrys lack of an effective energy policy and our flawed foreign policy
5924206 i havent felt so energized since mccarthy trying to end the vietnam war
5924207 i would love to be a part of this historical event its so long overdue
5924208 the boys call me e rock and i do all i can to make a difference in their lives
5924209 this was the first campaign i felt i needed to support i dont have a lot of money but i donate what i can because i believe in barack
5924210 as a christian i have seen it repeated that evangelical christians are required to vote republican when i heard baracks call to renewal speech i was surprised this is change i can believe in and many other young evangelical christians can believe in too for the first time in my life i got hooked on politics
5924211 this is what we do for classy sports that dont require gimmicks
5924212 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later
5924213 some elements of doi bureaus could find themselves having to vacate their premises
5924214 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5924215 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2
5924216 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
5924217 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5924218 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5924219 its about shattered illusions the human world which rusalka yearns so much to be part of has in reality nothing to do with her dreams she encounters such coldness and cruelty and it proves a shock from which she never recovers
5924220 according to east slavic legend the rusalki are the ghosts of women who have committed suicide abandoned mistresses women who have had abortions and who have been burned as witches and who return to avenge their tormentors
5924221 i am neither dead nor alive neither a woman nor a nymph
5924222 i am condemned to roam this earth as a phantom
5924223 we need to take a good hard look at it
5924224 they were born a day apart they came down with the same infection and were born in the same hospital i think the public needs a clear assurance there was no link
5924225 given the severity of the infection and the rarity of both those infections occurring in that time frame it leaves some unanswered questions
5924226 the initial results of investigation suggest there doesnt appear to be a connection and it doesnt appear to be a hospital acquired infection
5924227 internal reviews go against open disclosure ive seen cases where families dont get answers
5924228 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5924229 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5924230 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5924231 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5924232 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5924233 we were trying not to make this another feel good story or another patriots dynasty story
5924234 we were trying to start our own dynasty a new york giants dynasty
5924235 if you think the star wars prequels are a disease then
5924236 i actually just looked at it for a while i just held it there and i laid it across my bed and i just stared at it for a few minutes just because as a kid growing up this is the ultimate ultimate in basketball
5924237 when i had a baby i smothered it with a pillow
5924238 offers a great amount of flexibility and auditing capabilities for a broad range of different assets we find this offering to be a good value for the money
5924239 the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies
5924240 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5924241 there is no room for these kinds of distortions and lies in this campaign
5924242 what senator obamas attackers dont tell you is that obama voted against these laws in illinois because they were clear attempts to undermine roe v wade
5924243 the bills senator obama voted against in illinois were crafted to undermine roe v wade
5924244 they do not address national right to lifes main contention that obama misrepresented the situation
5924245 while they agree that the 2003 illinois bill and the federal bill had the same language they wont concede the point that senator obama is pulling a fast one on the american public

5924253 i was anxious to get it done and put it behind me
5924254 you may quote me as saying that that imperial bastard will never set foot on american soil any time when im running this glorious country of ours and when i call him a sonofabitch im not using profanity im referring to the circumstances of his birth
5924255 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come
5924256 i feel like he trusts me to make the right decision on the field whether hes scrambling whether hes throwing it into tight coverage that im going to come down with it
5924257 you know some guys have been released at other places and people are picking them up youd like to pick up some of those guys and bring them in because theyve been in other camps and push some of our guys
5924258 unfortunately there are some guys right now on our roster that are borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
5924259 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve to be willing to release em and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5924260 in the city of god there will be a great thunder two brothers torn apart by chaos while the fortress endures the great leader will succumb
5924261 nosotros venimos de una situaci n en la que produc amos 5 000 kilogramos de grano por hect rea mientras que en la actualidad producimos de 10 a 12 000 kilogramos por hect rea
5924262 de manera que hemos duplicado la productividad en 10 a os
5924263 tenemos m s chinos comiendo m s indios comiendo m s africanos comiendo y m s brasile os comiendo
5924264 todo esto es tratado por la prensa como si fuera una crisis y se le vende al mundo como si fuera una crisis
5924265 sin ninguna arrogancia o autoimportancia los brasile os necesitamos tomar lo que para otros es una crisis como una extraordinaria oportunidad de transformarnos realmente nosotros mismos en el granero del mundo como mucha gente desde hace mucho tiempo pronostic
5924266 sin duda alguna hay potencial para producir si el gobierno no se atraviesa en el camino
5924267 nosotros ni siquiera vamos a pronunciar la palabra ayuda si el gobierno no pone obst culos a o tras a o generalmente el productor est incrementando la producci n
5924268 si nos referimos a la parte central de brasil todav a hay much simas reas no explotadas por eso no tengo dudas
5924269 lo que hemos visto en los diez ltimos a os es una revoluci n silenciosa en nuestro pa s principalmente en la producci n agroindustrial
5924270 venimos de ser un participante irrelevante del mercado internacional a ser uno de los mayores abastecedores mundiales de alimentos y biocarburantes
5924271 si usted mira lo que le ocurri a nuestra agricultura en t rminos de exportaciones de carne de ganado o de pollo de nuevo ramos irrelevantes y ahora tenemos la posici n del exportador de alimentos m s grande del mundo
5924272 el impacto emerger con m s intensidad dentro de 20 o 30 a os y hasta entonces deber amos estar prepar ndonos para ello
5924273 la perspectiva por el momento para las futuras cosechas es muy productiva por lo tanto brasil tiene el potencial para seguir creciendo alrededor del 5 al 6 anual en t rminos de aumento de las cosechas vamos a mantener de manera eficaz este ritmo en los pr ximos a os sin ning n problema
5924274 no estamos contra la expansi n de la capacidad del pa s de producir alimentos ni en contra de ayudar al desarrollo de brasil
5924275 usted puede aumentar la capacidad de producci n de alimentos con tecnolog a mejores pr cticas ocupando reas que ya est n degradadas invirtiendo en mejores cosechas
5924276 pero usted no puede aumentar su productividad a costa del medio ambiente porque el mercado global no acepta m s este precio
5924277 si tenemos el adecuado flujo de inversiones para la log stica la infraestructura la tecnolog a y el desarrollo de la tierra el pa s puede aumentar dos y medio hasta tres veces su producci n real en los pr ximos diez a os
5924278 desde luego tenemos aumentos de productividad que podr an venir de europa ee uu canad y argentina
5924279 pero donde uno encuentra las mejores condiciones para dar a la sociedad mundial la mejor tasa de retorno en t rminos de inversi n es en brasil
5924280 si usted habla de los pr ximos cinco a os ahora producimos 130 millones de toneladas de granos f cilmente podemos crecer a 250 millones de toneladas
5924281 en la actualidad producimos siete millones de hect reas de ca a de az car esto puede aumentar a 20 millones de hect reas ayudando con el suministro de etanol al mundo hoy s lo exportamos us 400 millones en frutas podemos pasar us 3 000 millones
5924282 despu s est frica creo que para frica esto podr a ser la redenci n en t rminos de inclusi n de la gente en sistemas de producci n y haciendo que produzca alimentos y biocarburantes para el mundo
5924283 la demanda mundial de alimentos es de mil millones de toneladas y brasil s lo produce 150 millones
5924284 brasil produce 150 millones de toneladas y el plan que lanz el gobierno para obtener m s alimentos producir seis millones m s lo que deja s lo un mill n de toneladas para la exportaci n c mo va a ser brasil el granero de la producci n de alimentos

5924287 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5924288 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5924289 a guy like izzy is important to us because of all he can do he was playing a very good shortstop for us
5924290 it does affect our depth at that position but we feel pretty good about what sean rodriguez and brandon wood can do
5924291 he rodriguez has been evaluated at shortstop he played shortstop for the whole year at double a in 2007
5924292 we dont have concerns about his makeup and what he can do after watching him start at second base 21 times earlier this year when howie kendrick was injured with young players there are always some things hes going to have to do to show hes ready
5924293 he made some swing adjustments with mickey hatcher angels hitting coach when he was up here his path to the ball is much shorter hes showing as much power as he ever has but hes getting deeper into counts and having a shorter path to the ball has allowed him to do that
5924294 were always evaluating what might be out there to strengthen our club but right now theres nothing imminent as far as making a move in that direction
5924295 were moving forward with the mindset that sean rodriguez and brandon wood will be our depth at that position if something were to happen to erick and hopefully thats a big if
5924296 what were seeing here is that despite the concerns we had coming into the third quarter they are not being overwhelmed by a currency hit yet
5924297 overall its a good report but i believe the outlook still remains cloudy
5924298 theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar this is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line but its difficult to assess
5924299 margins unexpectedly declined in their printer division in their server division and in their software division
5924300 google is a good corporate resident and they pay a lot of lease revenue but they dont pay as much to local governments as manufacturing did
5924301 all of the areas cities are going to have to adjust to that
5924302 those three years may be tough here in mountain view
5924303 nationwide there is a slowdown and no one has really gotten a handle on that
5924304 i like to build relationships with employees and make sure they are happy
5924305 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
5924306 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
5924307 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
5924308 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
5924309 we were looking for an under the radar sort of product
5924310 our eight distributors cover only about half the country and there has been very little penetration of international markets so far
5924311 the penetration of the potential market is only about 2 percent
5924312 so with a market so large and penetration so small we figure our main challenge is just to go out and sell
5924313 i thought id do some fish angling for dinner while the people were on the island i turned the boat around as usual and was going to step on board when i slipped fell onto the pier and from there into the ocean
5924314 the boat was loose and drifted away from the pier i thought it was rather silly to be there like a fool with people on the island and no boat so i decided to swim after it
5924315 the boat just offered its right bow to me where i was sitting on the cliff so i could walk onboard like a gentleman
5924316 i thought it was kind of it not every skagfjordian stallion would have done the same skagafj rdur is famous for its horses i then sailed the boat back to the pier and had put on my flotation suit before the people came back onboard like nothing had happened
5924317 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5924318 you cant make me ive done my time im a free man

5924323 lo importante es que estas personas estan libres si el gobierno lo hiso para sacar un redito politico o no creo que no es lo mas importante lo que importa es la libertad de ellos y seguir luchando por los que aun siguen secuestrados

5924352 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5924353 said one of fannie maes achievements in 2006 was expanding its involvement in the market for subprime and other nontraditional mortgages
5924354 internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble fannie mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low income borrowers
5924355 fannie mae documents from the period obtained by the washington post paint a picture of a company with the dual incentives of fostering affordable housing and making money and of one caught between the imperatives of increasing its market share while avoiding excessive risk
5924356 fannie mae aimed to benefit from subprime loans and expand the market for them and hoped to pass much of the risk on to others documents show along with subprime loans which were typically issued to borrowers with blemished credit the company targeted so called alt a loans which were often made with no verification of the borrowers income
5924357 to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings

5924367 but we dont push them beyond what we know theyre going to be able to do
5924368 say somebodys in trouble and theyre not on our team were still going to cheer for them
5924369 if you to want to attack the problem you have to include the whole family
5924370 were trying to build people who will go into the community and help us
5924371 we won the first battle but that doesnt mean the war is over

5924373 im going to hang my hat on the information provided to us my mark chubet
5924374 it seems pretty clear to me that the plant hasnt manufactured asphalt since 1987 and if thats not discontinued then i dont know what is
5924375 i think its clear oil and petroleum derivatives are considered hazardous materials
5924376 i have a great deal of difficulty determining that it would not jeopardize health and safety in the face of a board of health determination that this would represent an increased health risk
5924377 this was a big concern for all the families down there especially the children and elderly
5924378 its a great celebration of my dad and its great for my dad
5924379 ive had goose bumps up my spine ever since they told me
5924380 it was awesome i got to fly with the whole family
5924381 the special thing about it was that it took a lot more punishment than the b 24 although they carried a little more they couldnt take the punishment that the b 17 did
5924382 when the germans decided to evacuate us we passed warehouse after warehouse that was stacked from the floor to the ceiling with red cross parcels
5924383 i can remember being in high school and college and asking dad questions about the war
5924384 he would answer and change the subject in the last 10 years thats changed tremendously
5924385 those kids who are in the gangs they can see were still here
5924386 if they realize people care theyll stay out of trouble
5924387 one of the things that makes prosecuting a case successful is witnesses
5924388 the streets can be dangerous people racing smoking and selling drugs

5924404 im not going to engage in a discussion with someone who has legal actions against the town
5924405 there are a lot of benefits to the site were proposing
5924406 were just sitting and waiting to see if the board of selectmen will contact us
5924407 if they want to do it in addition to fruit street im all ears
5924408 sometimes we didnt its not really the same as last year
5924409 i dont know what it is but its a different feeling this year
5924410 the speed the intensity everybody is into it i can promise you that youre going to see a different defense than last year
5924411 has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
5924412 people have been talking about it you hear it here and there
5924413 im not going to respond to the comment but you can say it added fuel to the fire
5924414 im trying to set up plans for the future because with football you never know you could get hurt the very next play
5924415 we were really thin last year and our coaches were struggling
5924416 coach mac mcwhorter was really struggling to keep us on top of our game depth wise putting the best spreads out there we had it together i think we just needed more time to grow and as the season came along we picked up the pace
5924417 theres still a lot of youth and theyre learning each others chemistry but its going to be really good
5924418 we probably have the most depth weve had since ive been here
5924419 the experience level is a whole other factor ive got one senior and thats cedric dockery and three juniors they havent played as much as a lot of lines have but ive got really good depth
5924420 i didnt get any the day of release i had no juice on those
5924421 kobe might want to think about moving here to live
5924422 ive lost earrings chains and all kinds of stuff this time i tuck em in when i go into crowds
5924423 last year when i came here i lost an earring a kid found it on the floor and held on to it for three hours and came back and gave it back to me thats crazy
5924424 deals with coke nutella mcdonalds and spalding expired but a coke brand vitaminwater took him back
5924425 in the next year kobe will sign a deal with a blue chip company that will prove hes back near the top of the athlete endorsement world
5924426 we knew he could defend real well but he cant do all that for 110 straight games in the nba and still be asked to scored 30 points he knew we didnt need the scoring as much
5924427 thats been a huge plus for us for kobe and lebron to buy in defensively when your two best players buy into the concept that helps you a lot
5924428 i felt like thats what we were kind of missing as far as european guards big guards tearing us up a little bit
5924429 and i was sick and tired of hearing about their guard play
5924430 i wanted to come in and say you know what i dont have to score 30 some points and do dunks all that stuff i want to come in and lock some people some up
5924431 i know he wishes he could be bigger for football but he has a great build
5924432 nyk can shift his feet in traffic very well avoiding the tacklers
5924433 he also has the ability to shift his feet in a different gear when needed he has great vision and awareness at all times the great ones seem to have this ability
5924434 hes tried to talk me into letting him be the punter and he says he can play qb if i need him
5924435 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5924436 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5924437 that better have been a braxton hicks contraction because we are not ready

5924439 we started with a focus to improve our group and the expectations and standards throughout the team and i think weve achieved that
5924440 now we could let ourselves down if we think thats it cue in the rack oh well weve done a pretty good job and be happy well no this competition goes for 22 weeks and the standards we set will have a big imprint on 2009
5924441 you never want to leave a season regardless of if you play in finals or not with a sour taste in your mouth and hopefully we dont
5924442 in the pre season you talk about things and you always go back towards the latter part of a season and if you didnt play in finals reflect how that went
5924443 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5924444 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5924445 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5924446 it stratford is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and lived all my life
5924447 that would be quite something to come out on the track and compete in front of my home fans cathy freeman all over again
5924448 too many businesses that compete across state borders are finding themselves caught up in a complex web of existing state based industrial relations laws leading to unnecessary legal bills and time wasting uncertainty
5924449 so consultation is also underway between the commonwealth and the states and territories to ensure the new workplace relations system be uniform throughout the private sector workforce
5924450 its part of our objective of creating a seamless national economy
5924451 the government has made it very clear that we are prepared to meet with as many people as it takes talk for as long as it takes and iron out as many unintended consequences as it needs in order to achieve our workplace relations goals
5924452 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5924453 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5924454 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5924455 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5924456 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5924457 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5924458 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5924459 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5924460 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5924461 the buck will stop with me because ill be the president
5924462 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of the government where he thinks hes above the law
5924463 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
5924464 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5924465 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5924466 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
5924467 we had a vigorous campaign senator clinton ran a historic campaign
5924468 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5924469 the nation is sending 700 billion us dollars every year overseas to oil exporting countries that do not like us very much
5924470 id like to win a championship fulfill that the dream
5924471 my little man son trey is now 6 foot tall and 155 pounds

5924479 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
5924480 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
5924481 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
5924482 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
5924483 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography
5924484 we dont want to see that happen again its just very important for historys sake that this material is archived the way that the printed material has always been archived

5924493 they should strive to have their hearings completed and the findings made public prior to july 1964 when the presidential campaigns will begin to get hot he stated it would be unfair to present the findings after july
5924494 ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the commission
5924495 he stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis however he thought it should be done
5924496 i referred to this weeks issue of newsweek magazine which contains a rather clear analysis of the report
5924497 i told congressman ford that newsweek was owned by the washington post and that apparently some one was trying to curry favor i told him we of course did not get along very well with either the washington post or newsweek he said that he was in the same boat that he liked neither one of these publications
5924498 except for information that he was an isolationist and active in organizing an american first committee while at yale university
5924499 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help
5924500 in view of congressman fords friendly attitude toward the fbi and the fact that he is a member of the house appropriations committee and will probably be reappointed to this committee in the next session of congress it is felt he should be presented a copy of the directors new book a study of communism the house appropriations committee of course is very important to us and it is felt such a gesture would be very beneficial in connection with our hill contact program
5924501 my dear congressman i want to let you know how much i enjoyed talking to mrs
5924502 apa yang dilakukan oleh sekretaris ketika menerima telepon apa sama dengan karyawan tadi
5924503 saya menegur si sekretaris setelah beberapa menit menaruh gagang telpon
5924504 tadi saya melihat seorang karyawan menerima telepon caranya langsung pada permasalahan saya maklum tapi mbak lain mbak kan seorang sekretaris
5924505 sama saja mbak sebaiknya sebutkan dulu identitas kita kemudian lanjutkan pada permasalahan biasakan seperti itu sehingga terbiasa dan apabila kepada orang atau pelanggan kita menjadi terbiasa pula tentu saja ketika di kantor ini mbak di rumah terserah anda saja
5924506 saya menerangkan kepada sekretaris tersebut kasihan mbak bila sudah lama bicara ternyata salah sambung dengan menyebut siapa kita maka dia sipenelepon langsung menyadari kesalahannya
5924507 its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
5924508 you can dream create design and build the most wonderful place in the world but it requires people to make the dream a reality
5924509 theres a big opportunity between the social and business space thats not being met
5924510 will the social space become a business space i think no
5924511 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult
5924512 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5924513 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days
5924514 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help
5924515 weve tried this morning to lure the whale out this morning but it has failed she said
5924516 we havent given up on the whale a spokeswoman said
5924517 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5924518 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5924519 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5924520 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5924521 all your are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed
5924522 for whatever candidate comes in second today theres plenty of time to reverse that order
5924523 the only way it would be damaging to one of the candidates is if the margin is breathtakingly high but my guess is it wont be
5924524 a commanding margin it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
5924525 we definitely have high hopes that under the new leadership of former senator ralph recto the neda will be able to pursue sound and practical near term development strategies aimed at achieving the highest possible employment rate while fighting inflation
5924526 construction related jobs tend to benefit poor families directly and indirectly
5924527 a construction worker is likely to come from a hard up household and ones he gets his wage he is likely to spend some of the money to buy extra food in the nearest carinderia or food vendor thus supporting yet another impoverished family
5924528 besides we really have to build new mass transport systems and enlarge existing ones that are now under enormous strain
5924529 and many commuters are using the faster and more economical rail transit systems and staying away from costlier and slower buses and taxicabs
5924530 and ample supply of farm produce is the best way for us to guarantee affordable food as long as we have plentiful supply of food that is within reach of ordinary families we can fight inflation
5924531 in fact the biggest driver of double digit inflation rate in the last few months was not high oil prices but the surge in the cost of rice due to previous reports of massive shortages of the staple
5924532 as to employment almost half of the totally jobless as well as underemployed are farm laborers thus government should also focus on creating new jobs and livelihood opportunities in the countryside
5924533 however if congress chooses not to suspend the vat on oil products then government should at least see to it that the extra vat income is spent wisely to benefit the greatest number of marginal families that are hardest hit by soaring consumer prices
5924534 hindi makaturangan na ang taong bayan ang nagsasakripisyo sa panahon ngayon hindi pwede na ang pag asa lang ng gobyerno sa pag kolekta ng tamang buwis ay nakasalalay sa mataas na presyo ng langis
5924535 ang ating dasal ay sanay hindi na tayo makaranas pa ng mga dagdag na pagtaas ng presyo ng langis pero kahit hindi tumaas ang presyo ng langis sa pandaigdigang merkado parusa pa rin ang vat sa ating mamamayan at dapat na itong tanggalin
5924536 maganda na pababa nang kaunti ang mga pump prices pero dapat ay siguraduhin ng gobyerno na hindi tayo pinagsasamantalahan ng mga higanteng kumpanya ng langis
5924537 we thought going in that congressman reichert has all the power on his side
5924538 what the results will be and what the results will mean
5924539 love of ones own language is love of country thus we must not only be proficient in english but also in filipino
5924540 we just have to be creative like archiving them in audio form for future reference
5924541 the realization of our dream to establish livelihood and skills training centers in fourth fifth and sixth class municipalities of our country is close at hand
5924542 this could be an effective way to better prepare the intended beneficiaries to engage in gainful employment and entrepreneurial works
5924543 this law will complement the small medium and micro enterprises act whose passage we also pushed the way i see it recipients of the livelihood and skills training programs in the centers to be established under the barangay kabuhayan law may well avail of the funding and technical support that are now available under the smes act
5924544 we are glad that our workers are finally home and look forward to the arrival of more of our distressed countrymen and their reunification with their families
5924545 our ofws are considered the biggest partners of our countrys economic development and they deserve due attention from government
5924546 the milf attacks against the towns of saranggani north cotabato and lanao del norte were characterized by the murder of defenseless civilians arson kidnapping hostage taking and destruction of properties
5924547 these are all predicate crimes that constitute as one of the elements of the crime of terrorism the other element is when these are committed
5924548 based on the pronouncements coming out of the milf leadership these depredatory acts had been committed to push the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain
5924549 the only remaining act of government is to officially declare that the milf is now categorized as terrorists like the abu sayyaf
5924550 if this happens the parameters in governments dealing with the milf will radically change this requires a radical change in the governments policy as it deals with the problem of the milf the peace process will have to be abandoned the milf will have to be pursued and any arrests made will be without bail
5924551 first there were the attacks in the north cotabato towns of alyosan misayap pikit tigkawayan and the attacks in some localities of saranggani yesterdays attack of 5 towns of lanao del norte was even worst ransacking and burning of the bank business establishments and residential houses killing of plain civilians for no reason at all and the taking of hostages and subsequent execution of the hostages all of these has created wide spread panic and extra ordinary fear that drove many families to evacuate to safer areas
5924552 i am therefore recommending the convening of the national security council because of the serious implications of what the government response to these is concerned many actions to be taken by the government may not be within the authority and capability of the executive department and therefore this matter is not only within the functions of the national security cluster of the cabinet but will require the presence of members of the legislature in the national security council
5924553 definitely if the peace process will be allowed to continue to proceed there is a need to redefine the parameters of this peace process
5924554 i do not agree with that reasoning because the meaning of the event the martyrdom of the late senator benigno aquino jr is diluted by transferring the actual celebration of the event to another date
5924555 i think the president is playing up to the crowd by saying we have an additional holiday but the net effect is the transfer destroys the meaning and solemnity of the occasion
5924556 people should be reminded of an event that took place on a particular day and celebrate it accordingly even at some sacrifice
5924557 governments order to crush any attempt to disturb peace in mindanao is a band aid solution to the problem that has hounded us for decades using the same tired method of counter attack will not put an end to this deeply rooted conflict in mindanao besides keeping a firm front against moro guerrillas aggressive reforms in mindanao in terms of social service and economic development must be the long term solution to this clash that has claimed so many lives and displaced thousands
5924558 the real face of the grp milf conflict is not just that of the muslim christian division but of the thousands of displaced women and children regardless of faith whose lives are not just put into danger but whose psychological and emotional well being are compromised of children soldiers who are exposed to brutality at such a tender stage in life of violence that deprives our citizens of their human rights while government is so focused on its offensive the moral fiber of our people in mindanao is on a breakdown the commission on human rights as one of the lead agencies on this issue must come in and monitor the human rights situation
5924559 if the milf as a whole has really no hand in these treacherous attacks then i challenge them to surrender their ground leaders specifically bravo and umbra kato as a sign of good faith
5924560 if the milf cannot surrender their rogue members they can choose to disown them if these ground leaders do not adhere to their organizations tenets and they prove to be obstacles to the peace path then why dont the leaders expel them from the organization
5924561 they should not protect these elements from being pursued by the government forces if indeed they have acted on their own in attacking several parts of mindanao
5924562 ninoy said he wanted to take the extra mile for peace in the land and convince president ferdinand marcos that it was time to end martial law and restore the country to its democratic moorings
5924563 if it is my fate to die by an assassins bullet so be it
5924564 these are matters of fact that in my mind make ninoy truly a hero a instrument of god of the fates if you like whose death purchased for the nation the rights and liberties that we now enjoy in the country
5924565 he talked fast worked fast and lived fast and the heavens apparent complicity to his agenda of speed in everything that he did opened the gates of opportunity for him
5924566 that observation it must be said was not true at all there were people who fought the martial law regime in various ways some peaceful others violent but it was only the assassination of ninoy that gave a nationally recognizable face to the heroic dimension of our society
5924567 all goto calls in gaia are routed through swfaddress as long as theyre not external links non swf pages or deeplinks
5924568 what kind of persecution do you want to know about
5924569 in february this year i visited a village of the pi tribe
5924570 while i was preaching in one of the house churches drunkards came and beat me up
5924571 when people declare that they want to follow jesus many are expelled from their villages they become outcasts in an instant
5924572 they come to me for help i get so frustrated
5924573 because many times i cant help them i dont have a place for them to stay and it breaks my heart
5924574 it is very much needed we would definitely like to provide this for our people
5924575 l en su tiempo libre se iba a la funeraria mar n y les dec a que si le pasaba algo alg n d a quer a que lo velaran de pie

5924582 todo aquel que se traslade a mount isa feo o guapo tiene una gran oportunidad de construirse una gran vida
5924583 loneliness is an emotional state in which a person or animal experiences a powerful feeling of emptiness and isolation loneliness is more than the feeling of wanting company or wanting to do something with another person loneliness is a feeling of being cut off disconnected and alienated from other people the lonely person may find it difficult or even impossible to have any form of meaningful human contact
5924584 thats the truth about being single it can be horrendous only
5924585 if female survival is the main explanation for male longevity then monogamous and polygamous men would live for about the same length of time instead it seems that fathering more kids with more wives leads to increased male longevity men then live long because theyre fertile well into their grey years the explanation could be both social and genetic men who continue fathering kids into their 60s and 70s could take better care for their bodies because they have mouths to feed but evolutionary forces acting over thousands of years could also select for longer lived men in polygamous cultures
5924586 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

5924590 its been a long day today but weve found some important improvements in a few different areas so its been worthwhile and i am leaving here feeling very happy weve worked on electronics and it seems weve found some improvements under accelleration then of course weve worked a lot with bridgestone on both front and rear tyres weve definitely found some good things in this area as well helping our agility and stability in the corners and we are faster with these new tyres its been a good test and now we are looking forward to the final six battles
5924591 weve had a full couple of days testing and everyone has worked very hard with great results this is probably our last test of the season so its been very important for us to have this chance to check many small things especially tyres electronics and setting we have had a long week here in brno but both the race and the test have been very successful and now were looking forward to misano
5924592 these have been two positive days because weve improved our performance a lot in comparison to the race at the weekend however we can not forget that we are still far from where we want to be so we can not give up we have tried a lot of new things but mainly tyres with michelin and we have been able to find some tenths now we have to work with san marino in mind because we really need to change our situation there and have a good race finally
5924593 as planned yesterday we have concentrated on testing rear tyres today following our work on the front yesterday from all of the michelin material we tested today we have been able to find some improvements and now we hope that they can provide us with these tyres for misano we still have work to do but motivation in the team is still high for the final six races and everyone still has the same goal to finish with some good races we know that jorge and the team deserve much better results than we had here in brno so we hope that we can turn things around in misano
5924594 for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming
5924595 i see more cranes in the sky in austin right now than i do in new orleans
5924596 i would say this to the president that i evacuated and went to beaumont and then to austin but i returned home to new orleans because i believed the promises he made from jackson square
5924597 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives

5924600 within the last few hours ive spoken with two of the finalists for the role of barack obamas running mate and to two other sources who are close to the process

5924609 there has been a suggestion from oil companies that there be differential pricing for selling diesel to power and industrial sector users as the demand for the fuel is rising fast on account of usage by these sectors
5924610 the demand for diesel is growing at more than 18 every month year on year against the normal growth of about 10 the incremental demand growth is coming from the power sector and industrial users
5924611 for indian oil it will only be a book entry as the companys refining units loss will be recovered by gains at the marketing unit but the move will hurt the standalone refining companies a lot who need money for expanding capacity

5924635 no recollection of meeting senator obama at any party in 2004 or at any other time
5924636 my assessment of tony rezko was that he was an immigrant who had sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps i think he saw me as somebody who had talent but he was probably also intrigued by my international background
5924637 i made a mistake in not seeing the potential conflicts of interest or appearances of impropriety
5924638 he perhaps thought that this would strengthen our relationship he could have even thought he was doing me a favor
5924639 gave me assurances that he was not doing anything wrong
5924640 a lantern of courage and faith that illuminated the way home with honor
5924641 i have made far too many mistakes in my own life to forever disparage people
5924642 now that im back i find a lot of hand wringing about this country i dont buy that i think america today is a better country than the one i left nearly six years ago
5924643 our large scale presence although essential for current stability also creates an angry reaction and therefore cant be a permanent solution
5924644 over the long run we need to go cheap quiet low footprint
5924645 they were the daniel boones who cut through the cumberland gap
5924646 they were making more money than any lawyer in history had made
5924647 the way the system developed it broke down the connection between lawyers and clients
5924648 these practices result in part from changes in the rules governing our profession
5924649 were not seeing a lot of al qaeda fighters theyve shifted here to facilitation and support
5924650 in rc east we have a number of disparate groups command and control are not linked up the young men will fight for whoever is paying the highest rate
5924651 has reconstituted some of its pre 9 11 operational capabilities through the exploitation of pakistans federally administered tribal areas
5924652 are you going to talk to them or go to war with them
5924653 there are attempts to cause mischief inside iran and go after the quds force some things are being done but not with the seriousness thats needed
5924654 when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
5924655 lend me billions right now or ill destroy the international financial system
5924656 perhaps only 30 percent to 40 percent through the trough
5924657 insanity consists of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
5924658 after working in the area today i decided to grab a late lunch very early dinner and i felt like korean food

5924663 during the month of august 2006 i have been enriching my personal yoga practice and yoga teaching skills by going on a 3 week yoga studio tour of various yoga classes and yoga studios in the san francisco bay area http ynottony1 blogs
5924664 suckin on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze dianes sittin on jackys lap hes got his hands between her knees
5924665 i go here every christmas eve with my parents what a cliche because this is some of the best chinese food in the city
5924666 im eating in your hood get you a outta bed
5924667 i must bring my mother here because this is what she used to cook for us when we were younger
5924668 wow this is a small store they wont have what i need
5924669 so i need um knobs like indicator knobs with kind of a retro feel my roommate is making rocketeer style jetpacks and he wants knobs and some tubing
5924670 heck if you only need to make one cut we can do that for you for free
5924671 youll feel like youre on the set of deadliest catch lots of hippy scruffy locals but some of the freshest well cooked food to be found
5924672 hey dont do that if you need change ill make it for you
5924673 if the russians have it it needs to be returned immediately
5924674 thats how you know for sure youre getting a canadian shopper
5924675 we love them theyre making business were having record breaking weeks and i think a lot of it has to do with the canadian business
5924676 currencies dont generally move very quickly so a five cent change in the space of a month or two by the standards of how these things move is a pretty big move in a pretty short period of time
5924677 so i think canadians coming down to vermont will tend to look more carefully at prices than they would have a couple of months ago
5924678 its a relatively small change it might be slightly noticeable but i dont think its going to be anything major
5924679 we accept canadian at par right now and theres a little bit of advantage the u s dollar over canadian but we do take it at par

5924683 we cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure america as long as there is a terrorist safe haven in northwest pakistan a year ago i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act
5924684 mccain criticised me and claimed i was for bombing our ally he refused to join my call to take out laden across the afghan border and instead spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5924685 the departure of president musharraf has given the us an opportunity to move away from a foreign policy focussed on one person to a pakistan policy
5924686 ive cosponsored a bill to triple non military aid to the pakistani people while ensuring that military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaida in the tribal regions of pakistan
5924687 ending the war in iraq will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in pak afghan border region this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5924688 with his overwhelming focus on iraq mccain argued that we could just muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5924689 ive called for at least two additional us combat brigades and an additional usd one billion in non military assistance for afghanistan with a demand for more action from its government
5924690 if you take the 10 cents with bratislava castle on it it must work in a vending machine in portugal
5924691 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
5924692 these changes are underway and there are more changes coming
5924693 unitarian universalism is a liberal religion that encompasses many faith traditions unitarian universalists include people who identify as christians jews buddhists hindus pagans atheists agnostics humanists and others as there is no official unitarian universalist creed unitarian universalists are free to search for truth on many paths to quote the rev marta flanagan we uphold the free search for truth we will not be bound by a statement of belief we do not ask anyone to subscribe to a creed we say ours is a non creedal religion ours is a free faith although we uphold shared principles individual unitarian universalists have varied beliefs about everything from scripture to rituals to god
5924694 we will not be bound by a statement of belief
5924695 we do not ask anyone to subscribe to a creed
5924696 its indeed a tragedy because he was a good captain but i am sure another captain will be found to steer the ship
5924697 the good thing is that he taught all of us how to govern this country with integrity
5924698 we have never had it this way since we gained independence and nothing will really change everything looks positive
5924699 we will surely find someone wearing the same team shirt and macroeconomic policy will continue the same way
5924700 economic transformation will continue so we can sustain our political and economic gains
5924701 but im feeling it now im hurtin when i have to get up
5924702 never mind just get in position for the next event would you this ones really important

5924710 when john rich recently took a florida stage to support the presidential campaign of john mccain he said somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically before singing johnnys song walk the line and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around john said not necessarily johnny supported democrat jimmy carter now johnnys daughter singer songwriter author rosanne cash has made her thoughts known on the matter with a statement posted on her website
5924711 james hetfield co founded the influential heavy metal band metallica and as its chief songwriter helped pen and perform strident songs such as
5924712 in 1992 when bill clinton won the democratic nomination washington progressives the leaders of unions think tanks and advocacy groups fell over themselves to rally around the man from hope part of this support was no doubt to make sure that he got elected after 12 dark years of presidents reagan and bush washington s notable liberals also decided to act as fobs friends of bill so as to ingratiate themselves to the future administration once at the left hand of power the reasoning went they could use their influence for good so the progressive community closed ranks around their friend or the man who was a friend of their friends
5924713 this february michelle obama caused a spasm of faux outrage on the right when in attempting to argue that her husbands campaign had brought something new to a political climate that had been so ugly for so long she said that for the first time in her adult life she was proud of her country though she obviously meant her countrys politics and not her country per se the reaction was predictable one voice joining the chorus of condemnation was that of cindy mccain who made sure to say that she has always been proud of her country now that the quadrennial exercise in skill endurance and jingoistic chest thumping we call a presidential campaign has been interrupted by the olympics there is a lot of patriotic feeling around but does it really make us feel any different about america than we did two weeks ago
5924714 would this agreement turn yahoo into a satellite in googles orbit
5924715 a champion of the democratisation of the sadc region in particular and the african continent in general as such his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people who at this stage are yearning for a new beginning which can unquestionably be characterised as democratic and a reflection of the will of the people
5924716 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
5924717 the region has truly lost one of the most influential figures contributing to resolving the zimbabwe situation it now leaves botswana alone
5924718 his mwanawasas leadership was slowly beginning to take away that conservative and freedom fighter mentality which has been undermining governance and democracy in the region the onus now is on the other regional leaders to consolidate on that
5924719 there will be a lot of infighting for the presidency as the mmd has no party vice president who should have been an automatic replacement for president mwanawasa they may have to go to the national convention but time is not allowing them i think we shall soon see the formation of a break away party from mmd before the elections
5924720 i support off shore drilling immediately in the 60 million off shore acres that are already leased to oil companies i think they ought to begin now to do the drilling either use or lose those leases
5924721 im a strong advocate of off shore drilling for oil and natural gas in the state of north carolina it will create jobs in the long term it will lower the price of gasoline and neutral gas not only in north carolina but as other states also do it we all benefit as a public and it will also improve our national security
5924722 what i want to do is implement an education policy that connects to where the jobs in north carolina and where we need jobs in north carolina
5924723 we want to focus on building jobs for a 21s century economy good high paying jobs so that everybody will have a chance and you do that by having world class public schools
5924724 youve got to let the leaders of the gangs and folks that remind me of what organized crime used to look like understand that we have laws in place now that we can bundle together 4 or 5 heinous charges and we can lock them away for a lot of years
5924725 the state has been asleep at the wheel on this issue and now they finally passed gang legislation but in committee they weakened it they weakened it and its inexcusable that we arent moving quicker on this issue and as governor this will be a major priority of mine
5924726 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right
5924727 one of most amazing programs moyers has done period in all his years on television
5924728 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5924729 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5924730 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5924731 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5924732 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5924733 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5924734 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5924735 we started with a focus to improve our group and the expectations and standards throughout the team and i think weve achieved that
5924736 now we could let ourselves down if we think thats it cue in the rack oh well weve done a pretty good job and be happy well no this competition goes for 22 weeks and the standards we set will have a big imprint on 2009
5924737 you never want to leave a season regardless of if you play in finals or not with a sour taste in your mouth and hopefully we dont
5924738 in the pre season you talk about things and you always go back towards the latter part of a season and if you didnt play in finals reflect how that went
5924739 if you finish poorly that could be the seed thats left inside your head that makes it a bit difficult to overcome
5924740 too many businesses that compete across state borders are finding themselves caught up in a complex web of existing state based industrial relations laws leading to unnecessary legal bills and time wasting uncertainty
5924741 so consultation is also underway between the commonwealth and the states and territories to ensure the new workplace relations system be uniform throughout the private sector workforce
5924742 its part of our objective of creating a seamless national economy
5924743 the government has made it very clear that we are prepared to meet with as many people as it takes talk for as long as it takes and iron out as many unintended consequences as it needs in order to achieve our workplace relations goals
5924744 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5924745 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5924746 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5924747 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5924748 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5924749 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5924750 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5924751 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5924752 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5924753 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5924754 it stratford is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and lived all my life
5924755 that would be quite something to come out on the track and compete in front of my home fans cathy freeman all over again
5924756 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5924757 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5924758 the buck will stop with me because ill be the president
5924759 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of the government where he thinks hes above the law

5924761 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5924762 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5924763 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
5924764 we had a vigorous campaign senator clinton ran a historic campaign
5924765 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5924766 the nation is sending 700 billion us dollars every year overseas to oil exporting countries that do not like us very much
5924767 take adequate protective measures against a possible invasion of the west coast
5924768 charged with the responsibility of our national defense had ample ground for concluding that they must face the danger of invasion
5924769 the hotel developers had to change some stuff in their plans at marriotts request dealing with them is kind of slow
5924770 they finally got the plans approved and the latest ive heard is that construction will start the last week of august
5924771 today was a pretty good day i really pushed it i gave it my all to see what i could do
5924772 i hate to look so far down the road because this is a tricky situation
5924773 its one of those things where it feels really good one day and you come back another day and its sore
5924774 its one of those injuries where you have to really monitor and make sure im not overdoing it
5924775 you gave me david bowie you gave me the sex pistols in december 2008 with my punk band bramstocker i will give you a special vynil edition of our new song je hais la france 3 months before the release of the song worldwide if i dont do enough music its because im a movie actor in hollywood now but im first of all one of you people of the united kingdom who found a way to use the blues to make the rock sound forever see you on the nme website with the first music video of my other band vidal junction thanks to the talent of the american contemporary artist candice johnson i love you england you rock so much
5924776 for 10 years we became accustomed to the canadian dollar at 75 to 80 cents which fundamentally meant for an american coming up here you come up for two days and the third day is free
5924777 you put all of those together and the numbers from the u s are down theres no doubt about that at all
5924778 when consumer confidence is shaken discretionary expenditures like travel are affected
5924779 that same day visitor from the united states has just been disappearing there has been some effort to shift marketing in the u s to a longer haul visitor
5924780 i encourage hoteliers all the time to look at your market and then make sure that you devote your resources very very carefully to that
5924781 a lot of the international visitors that have come to canada those travel decisions were made six eight ten months ago
5924782 although we may see gas prices impacting some short term decision making we really havent started to feel the effects of it
5924783 we are passionate about building strong relationships with our travel agents and travel partners we recognise the importance of our travel agents in just about every stage of the travel distribution chain as they are the point of contact that ensures a great end to end experience for the traveller going in and out of brunei
5924784 earlier this year we had accomplished another great mission with our brunei travel agents as we work closely to meet the international air transport associations requirement of 100 per cent electronic ticketing by june 1
5924785 the min you get one with somebody its like all of a sudden the relationship ends
5924786 the diaries beautifully written in his own fine hand and often very revealing are a work of art in themselves
5924787 he was an absolutely wonderful writer not a comma needed changing
5924788 i have been working closely with humphs son stephen on a daily basis sifting and organising the material into what we see as the ultimate lyttelton book it is a real privilege to be publishing it
5924789 we have had the ambition to give a new feeling to the experience of private banking here the environment must be accessible and friendly yet have a special sense of contemporary design the two most important features to our design are first the smooth surfaces that shape the ceiling and walls into a continuous flowing world and second the contrasting materials of white plaster and two types of wood veneers the subtle curvatures and angles of the surfaces are specially designed to help the space become embracing while the colors and materials combine to give a fresh warm overall feeling to the space
5924790 did you hear what those girls just said to lily
5924791 go away ching chong girl ahh sooo ching chong chheee do you understand english ching chong girl
5924792 compared to the pressure of leading a mega production drama i am more worried on the fans expectation of me after lurking for such a long period of time 5 years in fact im afraid i cant perform better however due to the excellent script and filming atmosphere this drama is definitely worth the anticipation
5924793 dong chul experienced an ill fated life in the process of taking revenge against the culprit shin tae hwan jo min ki but deep in his heart he is filled with love towards his family and loved ones a self restrained and manly character like lee dong chul is the primary reason why i chose to act in this drama
5924794 although in the past i have seen the workings of blackjack and baccarat but to familiarize myself with all the rules and regulations takes me a long time hence a lot of time is spent on the pre production
5924795 this drama is a lengthy 50 episodes so i have to take it as running a marathon and control my pace well east of eden describes family love brotherly love conflict between two different families and has a well written plot hope it can gain the attention of everyone
5924796 runnnnnnnnn you are going to miss the bus to your school
5924797 my name is shanna and i am in black because i a mourning my loss of choices

5924801 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
5924802 local teen who had a courageous battle with cancer john challis died today at home
5924803 though it is i admit the tiniest bit unlike i anticipated
5924804 it could be days if not weeks before organizers have a final tally on how many people got new deals from lenders who some have criticized for not being accessible enough for struggling homeowners as the housing crunch intensifies
5924805 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5924806 none of you can say for sure when life begins and should be a decision allowed by government
5924807 he ripped off the muzzle ive never seen anything do that before
5924808 it was on and then it was on the floor and he was in the carrier
5924809 the cat in that carrier ripped off the muzzle when shirley gave him his shot
5924810 he ripped off the muzzle the blue one really ive never seen anything get one of those off
5924811 i still do a lot of underground records but people dont seem to pay attention to a lot of these things like they would a 50 or g unit record
5924812 whats kind of weird about it is that 50 can do it and people will with it but for some reason people only with his version of it
5924813 using a hand held mobile is just pure laziness with the amount of bluetooth options out there theres just no excuse
5924814 i think it is a combination of factors people are trying to make up for lost time stuck in traffic by trying to do things on the run like eating and putting on make up
5924815 people get blas about these things but one moments lack of concentration could mean the end of your life or someone elses
5924816 you could be charged with dangerous or negligent driving causing death
5924817 if you dont have proper control of your vehicle because you are talking on a hands free mobile phone you are guilty of an offence
5924818 it all comes down to how well you can transfer energy from your body to a complex fluid medium
5924819 swimming underwater is always better than swimming on the surface because it eliminates wave drag
5924820 even when coaches have figured out things that work well they dont know why they work well
5924821 michael phelps has incredibly flexible ankles and he can flop his ankles like a dolphin fluke
5924822 of all the swimmers weve tested michaels parameters are closest to that of a dolphin
5924823 the suits do help and the fact that the pool is deeper and wider has some effect but why is phelps so fast
5924824 a lot of people are surprised if not a bit shocked at the total cost of owning and operating a vehicle
5924825 they mostly accept that they have to have the vehicle and generally equate fuel costs with the costs of owning a vehicle but when you add it all up its much more than that
5924826 but while the fuel price varies its the relativity between these numbers that is important
5924827 you can see enormous relative differences between these categories and even within some categories
5924828 do not lay up for yourselves treasure on earth where rust and moth destroy and thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven for where you treasure is there will your heart be also
5924829 how will we ever make ends meet we already struggle now maybe i can babysit maybe i can learn to do taxes
5924830 do not worry about tomorrow tomorrow has enough worries of its own
5924831 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
5924832 well honey she must always defend the constitution and bill of rights against any and all that attempt to weaken or destroy them for these along with the declaration of independence are the documents that define anyone attempting to change the constitution without going through the proper steps of ratifying an amendment must be stopped and the constitution left unchanged
5924833 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
5924834 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
5924835 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
5924836 it gives rapists permission to say well she had on a miniskirt
5924837 i need a different one this one is a boy color
5924838 what its green its just a cool color youre fine
5924839 no that sticker is for boys i want the girl sticker
5924840 diego is a boy its for boys i am not watching that
5924841 i cant watch doras cowboy movie it has cowboys cowboys are
5924842 an important part of a compatible relationship is ensuring that each partners values coincide and to learn that takes time discussion observation and interpersonal interaction not an initial impression based on superficial cues
5924843 theyre too limiting and dont allow for chemistry which is more intangible and valuable
5924844 the classic couple with nothing in common except their on fire fights plays well in the movies but in real life that attraction fizzles quickly
5924845 if you dont like to do the same things there will be nothing for you to do outside of the bedroom and if you dont want the same things for the future what kind of future can you have
5924846 some of the best relationships are those where both parties have completely independent hobbies and allow for the concept of his her and our time
5924847 a kiss can be a romantic erotic experience with someone you find physically attractive but a relationship will crumble without more complex attributes like shared values
5924848 constantly thinking about another person isnt love its infatuation and infatuation has no correlation with being a good match
5924849 if you have warm and comfortable feelings when you think about your date that indicates a relationship built on stability trust and a strong friendship factor denoting a relationship that will more likely wear well over time

5924853 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement

5924899 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5924900 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5924901 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5924902 the icc has got the unambiguous understanding from a collective view on pakistan
5924903 hopefully the icc having now heard the concerns of the players will make a common sense decision and move the event
5924904 if the tournament is moved to sri lanka we will have to go through the same security process with cricket australia that we did for pakistan
5924905 our major concern is time with only 20 days to the start of the event
5924906 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan where as the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5924907 certainly we will need a detailed security assessment of sri lanka should the tournament be moved there before making any decisions
5924908 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals
5924909 setiap orang membuat kesalahan itulah sebabnya pada setiap pensil ada penghapusnya
5924910 wahai pensil tugasmu yang pertama dan utama adalah membantu orang sehingga memudahkan mereka menulis kamu boleh melakukan fungsi apa pun tapi tugas utamamu adalah sebagai alat penulis kalau kamu gagal berfungsi sebagai alat tulis macet rusak maka tugas utamamu gagal
5924911 kedua agar dirimu bisa berfungsi dengan sempurna kamu akan mengalami proses penajaman memang meyakitkan tapi itulah yang akan membuat dirimu menjadi berguna dan berfungsi optimal
5924912 ketiga yang penting bukanlah yang ada di luar dirimu yang penting yang utama dan yang paling berguna adalah yang ada di dalam dirimu itulah yang membuat dirimu berharga dan berguna bagi manusia
5924913 keempat kamu tidak bisa berfungsi sendirian agar bisa berguna dan bermanfaat maka kamu harus membiarkan dirimu bekerja sama dengan manusia yang menggunakanmu
5924914 kelima di saat saat terakhir apa yang telah engkau hasilkan itulah yang menunjukkan seberapa hebatnya dirimu yang sesungguhnya bukanlah pensil utuh yang dianggap berhasil melainkan pensil pensil yang telah membantu menghasilkan karya terbaik yang berfungsi hingga potongan terpendek itulah yang sebenarnya paling mencapai tujuanmu dibuat
5924915 tujuan hidup yang jelas membuat orang punya harapan serta tidak mengakhiri hidupnya
5924916 how do you follow that what can you do to follow that
5924917 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5924918 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city
5924919 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
5924920 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
5924921 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton
5924922 the safir ambassador satellite carrier was launched today and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit
5924923 sanctions have not isolated us instead we have become more independent
5924924 who brought you here and what are you doing in this place and what do you have here
5924925 thus and so has micah done to me and he has hired me and i have become his priest
5924926 inquire of god please that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous
5924927 go in peace your way in which you are going has the lords approval
5924928 arise and let us go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good
5924929 when you enter you shall come to a secure people with a spacious land for god has given it into your hand a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth
5924930 do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what you should do
5924931 be silent put your hand over your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and a family in israel
5924932 what is the matter with you that you have assembled together
5924933 you have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and have gone away and what do i have besides
5924934 do not let your voice be heard among us lest fierce men fall upon you and you lose your life with the lives of your household
5924935 the phrase one flesh or being part of another persons flesh or bone is often used in the old testament with reference to family relationships therefore when a husband and a wife become one flesh in one sense it means that they become part of one anothers family yet the bible portrays the marriage relationship as an even deeper level of intimacy its a physical union where you actually share part of your own being with another person
5924936 when two people become married they become one person when that marriage is separated by divorce there are significant consequences because the one flesh relationship is severed that is a difficult thing to adjust to and it requires all of gods resources to be brought to bear so that you can learn how to live as a person who is no longer one flesh with someone
5924937 for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and they will become one flesh
5924938 as i have always said it aint official until you read it here
5924939 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
5924940 what nikki sixx knows about branding and the rock audience that you might not is what we aim to find out when he joins us at summit 13 on september 18th in austin
5924941 in case you didnt know comics were supposed to be read from right to left
5924942 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5924943 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5924944 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
5924945 before you look for salvation in truth you must question what truth really is
5924946 so sehr wie hier stand fabian noch nie unter druck deswegen geht das ergebnis in ordnung
5924947 es ist eine dumme einstellung wenn es nur um die goldmedaille geht
5924948 aber wenn jeder irgendwie von diesem verdammten gold redet drehst du irgendwann am rad
5924949 nach dem adler war gar nichts mehr im kopf da habe ich die automatik eingeschaltet und nur zu ende geturnt
5924950 wenn hier alles normal gelaufen w re h tte es gereicht aber es war nicht meine woche es waren nicht meine spiele
5924951 ihm muss hoch angerechnet werden dass er nach dem fehler den karren nicht hingeworfen hat
5924952 2012 seht ihr mich wieder und dann versuche ich wieder die goldmedaille zu holen entweder es klappt dort mit gold oder ich habe zumindest diese eine medaille von hier in der tasche
5924953 sharply reduce the costs of customer care and improve the quality of customer experience for mobile operators and large enterprises
5924954 the economy and fuel prices have caught up to that business as well
5924955 will be in 2009 but we expect it not to be good so well cut everything we can cut and were not going to start any new initiatives
5924956 frankly the airlines have already thrown overboard everything they can

5924958 i wish someone would get stabbed at one of our shows that would be killer
5924959 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5924960 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president
5924961 i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5924962 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
5924963 severus please for me dont take all those old wounds that you gained from james out on harry harry is not james do not blame him for what happened
5924964 this iconic roller skate functions as a bookend door stop or 1970s fetish object
5924965 i like to have fun as long as they dont get hurt
5924966 last night someone told me it was toby and something was going on i just let them do what they do as long as they respect each other and as long as they dont get mad when it happens
5924967 he had an outstanding game saturday especially as an inside rusher
5924968 this year hes our starter inside in nickel situations we also would like to get him some plays at defensive end
5924969 he wont do a lot of special teams this year which will be a little bit different from what he did last year
5924970 five of us got together walked about 10 blocks and then we see dudes walking on one side of the street and others coming from behind
5924971 next thing you know i got hit by one guy and everybody starting fighting
5924972 he would go in for three years come out for two then go back and do five
5924973 sometimes its a good thing to be a little hard headed
5924974 but you look at situations with adam jones and tank johnson and you realize how bad things can get at first i didnt know how to control myself i got into trouble a few times and we kept it in house but i think ive learned how to handle myself better
5924975 man could this be any more obvious of a pok mon rip off
5924976 initially it wont represent a lot of volume but tazo is a good brand and will be a good addition to the portfolio
5924977 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
5924978 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
5924979 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
5924980 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
5924981 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drug makers what they need to exert more influence
5924982 in order to cut off the interest of an occupant of the premises the occupant must be named as a party in the foreclosure proceedings

5925002 in holland kussen de vrouwen drie keer wow roept jos van aert enthousiast de oud etten leurenaar en huidige canadees geniet met volle teugen van zijn verblijf in nederland
5925003 ik wilde terugkomen voordat ik oud werd ik ben zo blij dat ik nu hier ben ik was negen jaar oud toen we weggingen alles is veranderd maar ik vind het heel bijzonder dat de kerk en mijn oude school pastoor van arsschool rm er nog staan toen ik daar stond dat voelde ik het hardste
5925004 ik wilde al lang terugkomen en ik ben in 1980 hier geweest maar ik ben heel blij dat ik het nu na 28 jaar weer gedaan heb holland is zo mooi zo mooi al dat groen en die stenen huizen in canada is alles van hout mijn dochter is er ook bij ze wilde zo graag nederland zien
5925005 frans en ik hebben vroeger nog eens verkering gehad en hij kent de familie goed
5925006 in dit huis woonden vroeger lam en aart taks die zijn al in 1927 naar canada ge migreerd aangezien adri met een zoon van lam taks is getrouwd ligt hier dus ook een stukje familiegeschiedenis
5925007 ik wilde heel graag mee omdat ik wilde zien waar mijn moeder vandaan kwam het zijn voor mij nu geen verhalen meer ik zie het nu zelf dat maakt het echt ook al ben ik in canada geboren etten leur is toch een deel van mij nu begrijp ik moeder oma en daardoor ook mezelf beter
5925008 verhuizen naar een ander land met de boot en dan met de trein het leek voor ons kinderen op een fantastisch avontuur een spannende vakantie
5925009 er was amper iets bekend over canada we hadden geen televisie dus je had ook geen beeld van dat land je wist niet waar de van aerts in terecht zouden komen en dat met zestien kinderen
5925010 iedereen had zijn winterjas aan het was echter ook op een andere manier koud de volwassenen hadden moeite met het afscheid
5925011 ik was zes jaar maar ik weet nog goed dat ze vertrokken mijn moeder francisca sjo vond het erg want toos was haar lievelingszus ik hoorde dat opa de vries de vader van toos zijn grote zakdoek op de kade tevoorschijn haalde en zei die zie ik nooit meer terug en dat bleek ook zo te zijn
5925012 wij kinderen hadden schik you know we wisten niet hoe snel we op die boot moesten komen wij waren nooit ergens naar toe gegaan een keer een dagje met vader naar de dierentuin met de trein vanuit breda en vervolgens van breda in drie kwartier te voet naar huis verder kwamen wij nergens op reis met de bus de boot en de trein vonden wij een groot avontuur
5925013 van tevoren logeerden wij bij ooms en tantes en dat was al een belevenis voor ons het was noodzakelijk want ons huis en alles wat er in stond werd verkocht
5925014 de overtocht kostte 22 000 gulden vader moeder en de oudste kinderen hadden samen gespaard daarnaast bracht de verkoop een hoop op vader kocht voor iedereen nieuwe bedden nieuwe kleren en nieuwe fietsen die werden in een enorme kist naar canada gestuurd vier weken nadat we waren aangekomen werd de kist thuis bezorgd
5925015 de fietsen hebben we bijna niet gebruikt dat gaat niet in de prairie de wielen lopen vast in de klei als het regent blijft iedereen thuis in canada je komt dan de prairie niet uit
5925016 de pastoor heeft vader enorm geholpen met alle offici le documenten vader christ was een enorme doorzetter wat hij in zijn hoofd had gebeurde ook hij had al in 1948 willen emigreren maar kreeg geen toestemming omdat de kinderen nog te jong waren
5925017 met zestien kinderen op reis is heel wat ik ging mee om op de kleintjes te letten ik sta ook op de loopplankfoto bij het afscheid stond de familie niet te juichen op de kade we bewonderden de moed van chris en toos maar we vonden het eigenlijk verschrikkelijk
5925018 ik ben heel onderweg ziek geweest en heb niets gegeten dat was jammer want het eten was heel goed
5925019 alleen als moeder jarig was kochten we vroeger een taart anders nooit
5925020 ik klom altijd naar het hoogste punt van de boot dan zag je de voorkant van dat schip in de diepte van de golven verdwijnen dat vond ik prachtig
5925021 zo lang lang op het moment dat er land in zicht kwam was iedereen zo blij land land riepen ze
5925022 via een lange zeearm kom je bij quebec daar zagen we voor het eerst bergen ik was wel eens met de vereniging voor jonge boeren naar limburg geweest maar dit was indrukwekkend
5925023 quebec was pretty exciting maar we bleven kort en gingen meteen de trein in een reis van drie dagen op harde houten banken er waren geen slaapplaatsen dus we sliepen gewoon op onze jas
5925024 als we s avonds van de akker thuiskwamen stond de afdruk van de hak in mijn hand de hand was ook helemaal stijf ik was pas dertien en dan is twaalf uur aaneengesloten werken heel wat na het eten viel ik altijd doodmoe in slaap
5925025 tussen de middag brachten die boterhammen en koffie naar ons dat was de enige pauze tijdens de schoolvakanties moesten de jonge kinderen ook meewerken en voordat ze s ochtends naar school gingen melkten ze de koeien het was allemaal normaal in die tijd alleen op zondag na de kerkdienst mochten we een ijsje gaan kopen in de winkel achter de kerk
5925026 dat waren mijn neven die kende ik goed dat was leuk we hebben zelf nog meegebouwd aan het huis het was een blokhut gemaakt van hele boomstammen dat werd best mooi hoor van binnen helemaal aangesmeerd
5925027 bij ons thuis kon alles daar maakte niemand een probleem van we moesten ons nieuwe leven opbouwen en daar werkte iedereen aan mee alle kinderen leverden hun loon thuis in alles stond in het teken van de boerderij die vader wilde kopen
5925028 het vroor soms wel 45 graden in de prairie in de winter konden we niet op het land werken dus hadden we allemaal een ander baantje
5925029 ik werkte de hele dag bij het doktersgezin als iedereen thuiskwam moest ik naar de keuken daar kon ik eten en na de afwas werd ik geacht naar boven te gaan naar mijn kamer daar zat ik dan de hele avond in mijn eentje ik was de warmte en gezelligheid van onze familie gewend maar nu was ik vreselijk eenzaam ik mocht een keer per maand naar huis het was voor mij een harde kille tijd
5925030 iedere dag na school hielp ik in de winter mee bij de zusters ik zat daar de hele week ik kreeg kost en inwoning plus 25 dollar per maand in de weekends mocht ik naar huis het was gezellig bij de zusters ze hielpen me ook met taal goed bedoeld maar handig was dat niet want iedereen sprak frans en ik kreeg engelse les
5925031 zijn zoon was even oud als ik die ging naar school en ik deed het werk ik droeg extra dikke kleren en dan ging ik met twee paarden en een kar stro halen voor de koeien maar 45 graden vorst is wel erg koud moeder moest een gat in de rivier hakken om water te pakken als vader een varken had geslacht hing het vlees de hele winter gewoon buiten wij hadden geen vrieskist nodig
5925032 dat maakte ons niet veel uit ik ben deze zomer vijftig jaar getrouwd en we zijn ondertussen 22 keer verhuisd als je er op vooruit gaat is verhuizen niet erg
5925033 ik heb in winnipeg samen met mijn oudste broer sjaak nog meegewerkt aan de bouw van een elektriciteitscentrale en een brug op lulus island werd ik grasmaaier dat heb ik drie jaar gedaan daarna ben ik de bouw weer ingegaan vader werkte in een cementfabriek
5925034 dat waren nog eens tijden bijna vijf liter benzine voor 25 dollarcent
5925035 het was een belevenis die lieve tante uit canada komt ze was niets veranderd wat opviel was een halsketting met gele bloemen dat droeg niemand hier dat was de invloed van canada
5925036 tot diep in de nacht zaten moeder en to te praten
5925037 hij kreeg hier een hartaanval vreemd genoeg had hij daar geluk mee want hij was in canada niet verzekerd en nu had hij een reisverzekering afgesloten
5925038 als we in nederland waren gebleven was het ook goed gekomen maar de ruimte de natuur en de vrijheid in canada zijn ook wat waard
5925039 ik vind het interessant hier ligt een stuk van mijn leven ook het feit dat die grote familie naar canada is verhuisd spreekt me aan al die ruimte en natuur dat is toch prachtig
5925040 vader wilde dat huis graag kopen omdat het huurhuis waar wij woonden voor een familielid van de eigenaar bestemd was
5925041 iemand bood duizend gulden meer dan mijn vader dat was veel geld in die tijd maar christ hield zich aan de afspraak met vader en dat terwijl hij het geld heel goed kon gebruiken dat ben ik nooit vergeten daardoor konden wij in het huis gaan wonen
5925042 dat was wel druk met twee gezinnen wij sliepen met zn zevenen op zolder overdag werd er in drie ploegen gegeten er werd een wasteil vol aardappels geschild naarmate de dag van vertrek dichterbij kwam werden er steeds meer spullen ingepakt op het laatst zaten we met een minimum aan servies en bestek te eten om de beurt van hetzelfde bord
5925043 dat had best gekund want een van de oudste dochters was hevig verliefd op een jongen van de leur die moest ze achterlaten voor hetzelfde geld was ze hier gebleven
5925044 als de dag van gisteren herinner ik mij de familie van aert toos was mijn vriendin we waren even oud en zaten in dezelfde klas toen we dertien waren zijn ze weggegaan dat was heel verdrietig
5925045 die kleine dappere toos is me altijd bijgebleven wie weet mag ik haar nog eens ontmoeten
5925046 het heeft het iets losgemaakt over het zoeken naar je roots
5925047 vooral in deze vluchtige snelle maatschappij waarin grenzen technisch vervagen en alles bereikbaar lijkt hebben wij weinig oog voor onze banden met het verleden en verre familie
5925048 mijn moeder was de jongste zus van ome christ de dertiende van het gezin ze is in 2005 op 30 oktober overleden als laatste van de broers en zussen van christ
5925049 ome christ was in 1989 wedunaar geworden en is naar nederland gekomen hij heeft bij mijn ouders gelogeerd ik heb hem overal naar toe gereden zijn verdriet was zo groot en hij was zo emotioneel dat hij een hartaanval heeft gekregen hij mocht niet vliegen en is drie maanden gebleven iedere keer vroeg hij cees wanneer kom je nou naar canada het jaar daarop nu achttien jaar geleden ben ik gegaan hij liet mij toen een groot gedeelte zien van british columbia en alberta we gingen bij de meeste van zijn kinderen langs dit was een geweldige ervaring voor mij

5925055 they stuffed me with pills that made me as ill as the asthma
5925056 last night my wife and i were sitting in the living room talking about life in between we talked about the idea of living or dying
5925057 i said to her never let me live in a vegetative state totally dependent on machines and liquids from a bottle if you see me in that state i want you to disconnect all the contraptions that are keeping me alive id much rather die
5925058 then my wife got up from the sofa with a real look of admiration towards me and proceeded to disconnect the tv the cable the dish the dvd the computer the cell phone the ipod and the x box and then went to the fridge and threw away all my beer
5925059 self if nobodys here then who is this idiot that posted
5925060 yesterday sunday was the first time they have played together and there are signs today that it could be quite a good partnership which may get even better
5925061 that could be our central defensive partnership for the next five years they are both signed for that length of time so now it is up to them i have told steven to watch and learn i am sure he will because he has such a great attitude he got a bad knock when we scored that would have seen a lot of players come off but not steven if he does what we ask he will make another step up and go from the under 21s to where coloccini is the key is he wants to learn because some young players dont
5925062 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5925063 none of us were surprised that fernando scored in that way because we have seen him do it before in games and he also does it in training
5925064 it is great for us that we have that kind of player in our team and he is right back in the groove
5925065 hopefully it wont be my last opportunity but of course every year we have high hopes that well be closer to the top this year is the same we have strengthened the team with good quality players in the summer and hopefully we will be stronger this season
5925066 to so many incurable diseases in the past that then didnt have a cure but today they have a cure i encourage them today hiv aids does not have a cure but tomorrow maybe the cure
5925067 he is small in stature but he has a huge impact
5925068 he is humble and soft spoken deeply spiritual with a vision to help the poorest of the poor
5925069 he stops those with the disease from feeling stigmatized or worthless or dirty
5925070 why would they want to come here when they have everything over there
5925071 please dont talk about her because i miss her too much
5925072 they are going to audit us on a cash basis since we are a small school and receive less than 500 000 from the state per year this means they will be auditing our day to day expenditures which takes a lot less preparation on my end
5925073 los cinco departamentos van a bloquear el objetivo es recuperar el idh para que podamos aplicar nuestras autonom as
5925074 porque no van a tener una participaci n consciente de la ciudadan a que quiere paz y di logo
5925075 son anuncios que s lo intentan tensionar y generar confrontaci n frente a esto el gobierno va a seguir adoptando una postura de serenidad y firmeza democr tica pero no vamos a caer en provocaciones
5925076 es incre ble que venga gente a atacarnos porque no queremos acatar la huelga est n vulnerando nuestros derechos humanos
5925077 es un p simo presidente l ha provocado esta lucha de poder
5925078 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5925079 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5925080 it appears on just about every product thats belonged to some brand name youve never heard of for example
5925081 an the winner of the best brillo pad award sponsored by the brillo corporation is the brillo pad
5925082 the best low budget shoe sole replacement thats placed on a lower shop shelf
5925083 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5925084 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5925085 sarahs great ive always loved working with her she adds something very special and unique to the show and it also casts a certain light on my character
5925086 ill put it this way sara has been at the hands of one our long lists of very very bad people
5925087 i like the fact that we all have this common goal
5925088 were all going after the company and a lot of us cant stand each other
5925089 i would like to figure out a way to have my character redeem himself to be worth of the title hero to be worthy of saras love
5925090 that was a big concern of mine with our injuries i had to bring up a lot of freshmen
5925091 they played a lot of good minutes and really impressed me
5925092 were focused a lot on consistency no matter who the opponent is we want to play our brand of soccer
5925093 were a 2 style team this year ive traditionally been a run and gun coach but we want to focus on more midfield possession as well that was a major weakness last year and it cost us in the tournament
5925094 another area were addressing is our forwards were trying to teach them some different moves the hope is to get more open shots
5925095 ultimately we want to still be mainly an up and down team well be able to do that when we get everyone healthy to use our rotation and depth and rely on the conditioning program we had in july
5925096 i dont believe theres ever a favorite in the hurdles just because theres 10 obstacles
5925097 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5925098 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5925099 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5925100 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5925101 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5925102 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5925103 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5925104 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5925105 hinzman joined the us army in early 2001 partly out of a sense of patriotism and adventure however he was primarily attracted by the promise of financial support for a university education he says that more than a year after joining he realized that he could not become a killer he felt he could not dehumanize the people he was supposed to shoot he applied for conscientious objector co status in august 2002 but his command threw his application away hinzman subsequently reapplied while serving in afghanistan only to have his application turned down in afghanistan while his co application was being processed hinzman played a non combatant role as an assistant to haliburton employees serving meals to soldiers upon denial of his application for co status hinzman was ordered to return to active duty when his unit returned to the us with the understanding that they would soon be sent to iraq hinzman deserted crossing the canadian border in january 2004 with his wife and young son and claiming refugee status

5925108 a ctions demonstrations and pickets will take place in cities and towns all across canada
5925109 i feel that at this point i have no legal avenue for pursuing recognition of my beliefs so therefore i have no choice but to leave the military rather than do something i feel is immoral
5925110 kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city in addition to the provincial government and command of the police the kurds control the asaish the feared undercover security service that works with the american military and according to asaish commanders united states intelligence agencies
5925111 there is much fear the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5925112 i do believe the best solution for kirkk is that it be run as a separate region after resolving all pending issues between its segments conducting a census and then letting its population determine its fate through a referendum instead of one party imposing a solution
5925113 in daily demonstrations in favour of or against the new legislation
5925114 for the second time now in one month iraqi newspapers have published articles stating the u s will not accept any more iraqi refugees
5925115 the body of the martyr abbas ali hmoud will stay in the building until the iillers are captured
5925116 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
5925117 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
5925118 a multi national division center soldier was killed as a result of a rocket attack on a forward operating base near amarah aug 19
5925119 independent ralph nader planned to attend a rally at denver university on aug 27 the night before obama accepts his partys nomination and green party candidate cynthia mckinney was scheduled to address supporters after an anti war march through downtown denver on sunday the day before the convention opens
5925120 michael richardson massachusetts nader gonzalez 2008 coordinator will hold a weds aug 20 10 a m news conference at the elections division office mccormack bulding room 1705 one ashburton place boston mass 02108
5925121 due to tennessees oppressive election access laws ms mckinney will be listed on the ballot as an independent candidate which we can achieve with 275 valid signatures
5925122 our inflation figures are way above that we really need to change the way we do business
5925123 it may be related to the government expenditure around the elections although i dont have the details
5925124 when youre going into a hyper inflation cycle until such a time as the authorities take appropriate steps to counter it it seems to continue to spiral out of control
5925125 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5925126 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5925127 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5925128 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5925129 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5925130 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5925131 its not everyday that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5925132 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
5925133 to come to the aid of the working class and all the people of czechoslovakia to defend socialist gains
5925134 negotiations will not be easy because we will come across the implacable positions rooted in the turkish establishment for control over cyprus with the excuse of protecting the turkish cypriots
5925135 we believe we are totally justified in our decision to proceed to direct talks because there has been preparation which may not satisfy us fully but is in our opinion adequate to begin
5925136 in order to achieve this we will remain true to the principles of a settlement and be determined and flexible in order to overcome any problems
5925137 negotiations will not be easy because we will come across the implacable positions rooted in the turkish establishment for control over cyprus with the excuse of protecting the turkish cypriots
5925138 we wish once again to clarify that with the solution of the cyprus problem we are aiming at the creation of a reunited federal republic of cyprus which will be a continuation and evolvement of the republic of cyprus which was established in 1960 as the common state of greek cypriots and turkish cypriots our aim is for the solution to terminate the occupation and the influx of turkish settlers to reunite our people the land the institutions and the economy of our state our immovable aim is for the solution to restore and guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the people
5925139 make the people of cyprus the real master in their land and that no foreign power can have the right or the capacity to intervene at will in the internal affairs of our country we are struggling for an independent cyprus for the cypriots which will neither be a second greek state nor a state under guardianship an extension of anatolia
5925140 it is decisive in efforts for a solution that will be to the benefit and in the interests of our people
5925141 the acknowledgement of the difficulties is neither an expression of pessimism nor an announcement of failure in the difficult undertaking we have before us
5925142 through the negotiations we can reach an agreed on and mutually acceptable solution and we are working for the creation of the preconditions to reach the covetable result
5925143 already the international campaign we have promoted has borne the first results
5925144 is now acknowledging our sincere disposition and good will for a solution and is approaching our positions with understanding
5925145 we will continue the policy of undertaking initiatives you our overseas friends and your organisations also have a position and role in this policy through the relationships you have established over the years in the countries you live and work in the best ever climate that exists regarding cyprus creates conducive ground to activate the international community in the direction of contributing towards a solution
5925146 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5925147 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5925148 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5925149 racist erratic and unpredictable brutal inept bellicose irrational ridiculous and militaristic
5925150 im surrounded by a group of people who dont wear suits no offense
5925151 where do you propose citizens grow the money to pay for these increases
5925152 this makes me remember when this community delayed the southwest power plant 2 project and that cost us 110 million
5925153 if we under fund and delay natural gas those who are struggling to pay their bills will have to pay more in the long run
5925154 everyone always dreams about winning but you never think theres a reality to something you dream about
5925155 im not the superstitious type dont believe in higher powers but i hope she saw me
5925156 when i say crazy i dont mean it in a derogatory way
5925157 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5925158 unearthed documents showing that the illinois bill was amended to include such a clause and obama voted to kill it anyway
5925159 absolutely convinced that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
5925160 simon has had a wonderful year with a strike rate of a wicket every 30 deliveries
5925161 the plan was to have simon still playing in september whilst this has not quite been achieved i am delighted with his contribution and the plan will be to rehab simon in a way to get him back fitter and stronger for the cricket that lies ahead of him
5925162 you cant go into a one day series with your eyes on the game thats in six weeks time
5925163 this series is as important a one day series as any that england play in
5925164 its kevs pietersen first as captain and everyone wants to make a good impression after the way the new zealand series finished and theres no better way to play one of the best teams in the world than on your own turf
5925165 if we can put in some consistent performances we could provide an upset and that would be a perfect way to set us up for the winter
5925166 everyone in this one day squad has their roles to play and its important for kev as well as a new captain that people have clearly defined roles
5925167 whether people think at the back of their minds that an explosive performance here and there will put them in the shop window i dont know
5925168 im not sure how the selection policy for that twenty20 match is going to go but its a no brainer that the guys who perform well in the one day series are probably going to be heavily involved in that antigua thing
5925169 weve got five games now against south africa and more importantly everyone will be looking to win this series
5925170 its very important we put in some good performances given the way the new zealand series finished
5925171 im not sure how the selection policy for that twenty20 match is going to go but its a no brainer that the guys who perform well in the one day series are probably going to be heavily involved in that antigua thing
5925172 weve got five games now against south africa and more importantly everyone will be looking to win this series its very important we put in some good performances given the way the new zealand series finished
5925173 you cant go into a one day series with your eyes on the game thats in six weeks time
5925174 this series is as important a one day series as any that england play in
5925175 its kevs first as captain and everyone wants to make a good impression after the way the new zealand series finished and theres no better way to play one of the best teams in the world than on your own turf
5925176 if we can put in some consistent performances we could provide an upset and that would be a perfect way to set us up for the winter
5925177 if i get 300 grand after tax id buy a bright pink ferrari or something like that id be like a stupid championship footballer and just waste it
5925178 whats the point of having it anyway youd only end up getting left by your missus and shell take half anyway
5925179 obviously it the new road creates a real estate market for us

5925187 due to tennessees oppressive election access laws ms mckinney will be listed on the ballot as an independent candidate which we can achieve with 275 valid signatures
5925188 whether someone on my campaign did or not i dont know the answer to that question but it is rather humorous
5925189 to prevent someone else from grabbing them and making any mischief with them
5925190 second in appreciation we have taken the liberty of registering a few domains related to your name i propose we trade them so that everyone owns their own names and theres no confusion
5925191 its a nice try at a comeback it really is
5925192 we thought it was kind of funny and that we ought to treat it accordingly
5925193 its important to make sure that you keep a sense of scale about the political process
5925194 few organizations are closer to the community and able to draw people in and touch them than our churches and faith based groups
5925195 from 2002 through 2007 the federal government oper ated what it called a compassion capital fund that was designed to help faith based and community organizations expand their capac ity
5925196 of that amount delaware programs received just 100 000 two 50 000 grants
5925197 we in delaware need to be positioned to take advantage of a renewed federal focus on faith based initiatives
5925198 see your blood is dark not good blood should be bright red blood is stagnant that why you have poor circuwation in feet
5925199 we set our goals in both forms of the game
5925200 i was really confident in the test series because i really believe in the team that i had
5925201 we had played good test cricket in the lead up to the series and it was one of the series we had targeted
5925202 i had hoped to see the fruits of all our work come through and it did
5925203 we will always be there or thereabouts in one day cricket but as a word of caution we have lost shaun pollock and charl langeveldt who were two huge role players in our bowling attack
5925204 we have to find two guys to take their place so there will be a reshuffle and it is going to be interesting to see who stands up in the next two weeks
5925205 we havent been able to practise as much death bowling as we would have liked our variations our slower balls our yorkers bouncers which are crucial in one day cricket
5925206 hopefully ill work my way back in there im glad to be back practicing with my teammates and now you just hope things continue to go well
5925207 the moment you spend four or five months without being out there every day you get rusty thats the purpose of going for these five weeks is to go out there and get this rust off and get prepared what we need to do so obviously i want to get out there monday and if i can then i will
5925208 theres things that we do and we do against each other and theres things other teams do that we may not use as much its a chance to give each side of the ball different looks different blitzes different coverages different patterns the team that wins the coin toss now has the option to receive or defer to the second half if you look at whats happened in college football and theyve had the rule for a long time its about 90 percent of the time they defer
5925209 i think youre going to see a lot of people deferring because obviously if youre at home and youre good on defense you have the crowd noise and you think you can get a three and out and get a short field youd like to play defense first a lot of times it is a psychological advantage to have the ball the first possession of the second half i think what youre going to see is most teams deferring
5925210 one of the things was body wash a ton of body wash and it had to be a specific brand or else they wouldnt use it
5925211 thats what happens im a rookie so i take it and have fun with it
5925212 old and prudent guide who had taken the couple on 13 adventures in the mountains over the years
5925213 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped
5925214 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5925215 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas

5925222 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5925223 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5925224 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5925225 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5925226 too many businesses that compete across state borders are finding themselves caught up in a complex web of existing state based industrial relations laws leading to unnecessary legal bills and time wasting uncertainty
5925227 so consultation is also underway between the commonwealth and the states and territories to ensure the new workplace relations system be uniform throughout the private sector workforce
5925228 its part of our objective of creating a seamless national economy
5925229 the government has made it very clear that we are prepared to meet with as many people as it takes talk for as long as it takes and iron out as many unintended consequences as it needs in order to achieve our workplace relations goals
5925230 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5925231 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5925232 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5925233 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5925234 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5925235 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5925236 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5925237 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5925238 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5925239 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5925240 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
5925241 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
5925242 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
5925243 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
5925244 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
5925245 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
5925246 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
5925247 they want to know what were going to do about it
5925248 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
5925249 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
5925250 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
5925251 everything indicates that the brakes failed at a curve the truck hit a wall and flipped over ailton pereira the inspector of santo antonio do amparo district in the state of minas gerais told

5925254 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
5925255 i couldnt stand properly i wasnt aware of what i was doing he said
5925256 i dont want to be known forever as the piddler on the roof he said
5925257 id like to say im sorry but who hasnt p ed in public
5925258 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert he said
5925259 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb insp jaramazovic said
5925260 we are certainly appealing for members of the public to come forward if they have information in relation to the person responsible insp jaramazovic said
5925261 it appears to be an isolated incident not linked to any other threat
5925262 you can say the man was still in his senses despite his injuries he couldnt speak but he communicated with gestures police captain herman ruben gab told telam news agency after he responded to an emergency call by the mans nephew who heard the shots

5925267 we did that reduced the staff for a reason she said in sydney today
5925268 we looked across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened that was one of the ways we delivered the budget surplus and we thought that was very important in fighting inflation
5925269 the government has got no present plans to make changes
5925270 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
5925271 had the vegetation been adequately maintained the truck driver would have been able to clearly see the ghan stop and then proceed safely over the crossing when the train had passed
5925272 ive got 18 year olds telling me theyre ready to turn pro now instead of staying in the program
5925273 theres no reason to for every olympian doing well in the pro game theres 10 guys doing better who werent
5925274 none of them are happy about leaving their coaches or being away from home
5925275 the team is very talented we should have all been doing real good
5925276 but everything we went through just with the residency program itself they should put that off it almost seems like they were going against you
5925277 it would have been better off if we were with our coaches where they know us weve been with them for years i was away from my family i wasnt doing good in school i wasnt training how i wanted to train so i was real stressed out
5925278 they were trying to tell me to go at him go at him go at him
5925279 belum pernah rasulullah saw berpuasa sunnah di bulan bulan lain sebanyak yang ia lakukan di bulan syaban
5925280 berapa banyak orang berpuasa tidak mendapatkan sesuatu pun dari puasanya kecuali lapar

5925283 nabi saw adalah orang yang paling dermawan dan beliau lebih dermawan pada bulan ramadhan saat beliau ditemui jibril untuk membacakan kepadanya
5925284 right now its a time for our party to be united its not a time to be kicking people out and be divided
5925285 right now we all need to stand together especially in the loss in the election we didnt do so great we should have done a lot better than we did and its not the time to be getting rid of people we should be pulling people in
5925286 this is a free country ive been to some republican dinners myself with good friends of mine ive got good republican friends as well as democrats im a democrat from one end to the other but ive still got republican friends
5925287 if the other folks treat her this way we just want her to know theres more than enough room under our big tent
5925288 the chorus gloria in te domine gloria exultate translates to glory in you lord glory exalt him with exalt in the imperative mood a reference to psalm 30 2 in te domine speravi the song also contains references to colossians 2 9 10 only in you im complete and james 5 7 9 the door is open youre standing there

5925292 he was unharmed although he was in the same boat that capsized after a shooting war with soldiers
5925293 we have no exact number of those killed and wounded but intelligence reports showed they suffered heavy casualty
5925294 they were unsure how many were actually wounded or killed since they were caught unaware of the army presence in the area
5925295 any information on his where about could be sent to nearest military and police outpust
5925296 mongolia and its people are simply fantastic i had a lot of fun driving the grand vitara it was a super experience
5925297 i tried to spend as much time as possible behind the wheel of the family 4x4 in the bush before leaving to compete in the event and i practised tackling difficult obstacles but it didnt prepare me for the reality of the event it was incredible
5925298 im used to working under extreme conditions where giving up simply isnt an option i have a never say die attitude that has become a way of life yes we were an inexperienced team but we gave it everything we had and that makes this result so rewarding
5925299 a third of the participants failed to finish but our grand vitaras not only reached ulan bator but earned four top 10 places in the mongolian special stages considered the toughest of the event
5925300 thats a fitting tribute to the durability of the grand vitara and an apt celebration of its 20th anniversary
5925301 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later
5925302 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
5925303 wants to raise your taxes to pay for bigger government
5925304 in any negotiation that i might have when i go in my position will be that i am opposed to raising taxes
5925305 but we have to work together to save social security
5925306 is running for president to make big changes and fix social security americans are looking for leadership that will make real change and not raise taxes
5925307 the fact is sen obama will give 90 of americans a tax cut
5925308 thats a debate we should have openly and in good faith
5925309 i hope we can convince sen obama that its not a good idea
5925310 a lot of people think putting a pool in your backyard is physical therapy
5925311 the greatest gain is that these technologies can prevent or eliminate early institutionalization
5925312 these technologies can help older adults stay independent longer and it can give caregivers a greater sense of freedom
5925313 with these systems some people fall and sustain an injury and might not be able to push the button
5925314 the advantage of these products over the wearable type is that they dont require the user to activate or wear it
5925315 these games can improve the cognitive and physical attributes of seniors
5925316 they can change the socialization patterns and it has a positive impact on the social and mental well being of seniors
5925317 the only secure system is encased in concrete and never turned on
5925318 each of these should be considered strategies of last resort
5925319 they may raise cash quickly but each also carries long term consequences that can undermine financial security in retirement and pose the potential for losing a significant and sometimes irreplaceable asset
5925320 but tough financial times dont necessarily justify resorting to risky ways to make ends meet
5925321 the bottom line is that reverse mortgages are an expensive option that may prematurely deplete your home equity
5925322 if youre withdrawing money at the same time as your portfolio is going down you just exacerbated a bad situation
5925323 very often the company is going to continue to pay the dividend even though the value of the shares is going down so there can be some buffer there
5925324 as the market takes a tumble you want to be extra cautious about how much you take out of your portfolio
5925325 can make a big difference in getting through retirement successfully
5925326 the american people will do fine as long as they dont ask the government to take care of them
5925327 there really are a number of variables that people should consider before they start
5925328 how much can i earn and still receive social security benefits
5925329 the earnings test isnt a tax so much as a delay in benefits and so they shouldnt stop working or limit their earnings in order to avoid it
5925330 lets say your doctor tells you that you have six months to live
5925331 taking a reduced benefit at 62 could serve as a cap on the surviving spouses payout reducing that persons future benefits by tens of thousands of dollars
5925332 everything the earnest but over burdened citizen needs to know cheerfully narrated and handsomely presented
5925333 we see fair amount of bids at 1 4180 1 4190 from those who short singapore dollar yesterday so its going to range bound between 1 4080 and 1 4120 today
5925334 i think we follow the big picture the dollar was softer overnight so dollar ringgit opened lower today
5925335 i think its more of a technical move since a couple of resistances for the dollar have already been broken
5925336 it is with a heavy heart that i must announce the cancellation of barcamp oxford on september 20 21 heres why i the primary sponsor who we were in the final stages of negotiation with and who were ready to pay for 90 of everything have ceased trading and brought the administrators in having talked with the administrators there is no money for anything evidently the company in question were vc funded and blew too much money without keeping track ii the secondary sponsor who were initially willing to be a primary sponsor until they had marketing cutbacks have had further marketing cutbacks and are now unable to assist with the current economic climate
5925337 people who work in the field are seeing more of these cases
5925338 we mistakenly hired a few employees who had criminal records which should have disqualified them from employment
5925339 our franchise agreement did not specify the hiring requirements applicable to kelly jones
5925340 for a whole number of years they hadnt been monitored or watched by anyone
5925341 thats like creating a permanent underclass of individuals whove done something wrong at a young age
5925342 gimnastul s a mprumutat cu 40 000 de euro de la antrenori pentru a i opera feti a hipoacuzic la viena promi nd c va restitui banii din prima de la beijing
5925343 the greatest disparity we found between genders was along financial matters
5925344 where does financial planning for my life for the next 30 years fit on my personal agenda for the next 30 days
5925345 worry can lead to fear and fear can cause us to invest too conservatively
5925346 too often we find females in particular failing to benefit from the types of products that can give growth that can outstrip inflation
5925347 the first time i heard a zr1 doing acceleration runs last summer i couldnt believe this was a production car
5925348 the primary cause for most if not all the worlds ills
5925349 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5925350 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5925351 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5925352 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5925353 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5925354 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5925355 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5925356 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5925357 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5925358 i think if im here two weeks from now theyre going to release me
5925359 other than that if i get traded before then then i get traded
5925360 but if it comes down to the last cut and im still here theyre going to release me i dont think theres any doubt about that
5925361 you kind of want to keep things safe every now and then too i couldnt really see the defensive back
5925362 i wanted to keep it low and away in case the d b was going to try to undercut him either my guy was going to catch it or nobody was going to catch it
5925363 for the most part i thought i did ok there were a few things here and there that i would have done differently
5925364 im not one to read the newspaper and i dont even look at the internet
5925365 i just try to go by what people tell me
5925366 im just trying to get myself back to where i want to be and get to being a quarterback again
5925367 being around the guys again thats enough to keep me motivated im sure there are people who dont think i can come back from my injury
5925368 in summary the voters need but do not require fiscal and monetary competence the voters are getting exactly what they chose
5925369 many years ago the great british explorer george mallory who was to die on mount everest was asked why did he want to climb it he said because it is there well space is there and were going to climb it and the moon and the planets are there and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there and therefore as we set sail we ask gods blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked
5925370 a childrens climbing structure symbolic of the entrance of the united states into the space race
5925371 aesthetically its nice but its not a safe piece of equipment
5925372 even on a chilly afternoon it was worth the trip from his perch high above the park the 10 year old could grab a makeshift steering wheel and imagine soaring above the clouds he had few complaints about the 42 year old rocket
5925373 increasingly vocal about the importance of imaginative outdoor play for children
5925374 by their very nature need to be challenging and risky in order to attract children to go back again and keep trying it is fine for kids to fall over government intervention and our nanny state is damaging our childrens development this will have a lasting impact as they go through life if we are not careful we will become a completely risk averse country to the detriment of our growth and prosperity
5925375 todays children are missing out on unsupervised play a critical part of their mental and physical development incorporating risk is an important aspect of growing up we develop from learning by our mistakes and pushing our boundaries and this has to start in childhood
5925376 the key terms of the contract allowed the plaintiffs to renew their season tickets with cost certainty and maintain their priority seat numbers these terms are enforceable despite the sonics relocation to oklahoma city based on the foregoing the court should deny defendants motion for summary judgment and enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs
5925377 what we want to know from each candidate is his broad approach toward creating a health system that is affordable and accessible to all and spends less than we would otherwise spend
5925378 matt these seem bad should we go to the hall
5925379 and in which we will answer all of the following questions from the bible is it possible for the spirits of the dead to communciate with those who are living how does all of this play into halloween
5925380 the enemy is withdrawing and were conducting pursuit and blocking operations
5925381 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
5925382 is it possible to pay here and pick up the camera in frankston
5925383 well you can just ring them back and tell them that i dont want it
5925384 in a pit with a lion on a snowy day
5925385 and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to pursue the spirits leading through life than wild goose chase
5925386 im ruined for zoos its not the same seeing a caged animal its too safe its too tame its too predictable
5925387 i wonder if churches do to people what zoos to do animals jesus didnt die on the cross to keep us safe jesus died to make us dangerous
5925388 god ordained passions tend to get buried beneath day to day responsibilities
5925389 at some point in our spiritual journey most of us trade adventure for routine
5925390 as long as you are focused on what youve done wrong in the past you wont have energy left to dream kingdom dreams
5925391 sometimes our plans have to fail in order for gods plans to succeed
5925392 we need to quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death
5925393 we have sixteen outstanding debaters that have accepted the challenge that are geographically and stylistically diverse that will make for an educational and social experience that is second to none
5925394 the scenery of this town is totally different when i see it from the second floor
5925395 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
5925396 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
5925397 the london bus has become very popular as a means of transport for both tourists and local citizens
5925398 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
5925399 the steering wheel is heavy and vibration can be felt on rough roads
5925400 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
5925401 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
5925402 and its not fair it is not fair to the animals it is wrong
5925403 itd be no different than janitorial service coming in and closing the blinds when they clean
5925404 if the county has paid to have cameras in there theyve done it for a reason
5925405 and thats because they want to be seeing whats going in that room
5925406 the doctor actually cut dorocina open cleaned her insides and then closed her back up with vines that are like string
5925407 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5925408 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5925409 its cheaper than producing it here at home a governmental war on energy imports will by definition raise energy prices
5925410 i have set before the american people an energy plan the lexington project named for the town where americans asserted their independence once before
5925411 700 billion are leaving this country to foreign nations every year the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5925412 w e can provide loan guarantees and venture capital to those with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market
5925413 the most massive peacetime commitment of funds to develop americas own alternative
5925414 anyone who develops such a device will earn profits dwarfing 300 million simply by selling it on the market theres absolutely no need for any such taxpayer funded prize
5925415 there is something i want to tell you i finally found my goat my aunt stole it everyone knows it is not hers yet she herds it to her pen every evening i almost went to ask her about it gods spirit stopped me
5925416 i could go to her but she will be shamed and angered she will then stop going to the meetings to hear gods words she will also stop coming to the literacy classes to learn to read we manjuis are like that
5925417 her learning is more important to me than my goat it really hurts that she would covet and take what is not hers however my goat is now her goat
5925418 he was again praying to his great creator being thanking him for bringing these boys to the jungle to help us
5925419 asking him to give these big strong boys good wives so they could come back and help us in this work
5925420 wow now the tables are turning god is using these bagwidos to teach us and encourage us as we work alongside them it just doesnt get any better than that
5925421 announced alongside the archos 5 the archos 7 is in the same class of devices except that it boast an even larger display and storage 320gb max the display resolution stays the same 800x480 that might be great for those who think that such a resolution is too small on a 5
5925422 kita harus segera mengirim surat ke pertamina agar menerbitkan ro ke pabrik kita akan kirim surat itu besok
5925423 highly effective teachers early childhood education college bound curriculum and equal instructional materials
5925424 black students are performing the best in states like north dakota and vermont where there are the fewest black students
5925425 alternatively where white males are trapped in under resourced schools like indianapolis and detroit they performed as poorly or worse than black males
5925426 the farc made themselves into criminals a long time ago
5925427 we are simply tired of this i e farcs violence
5925428 we have in fact put considerable emphasis on how al qaeda in iraq generates resources and they do it again like a mafia does that we would be familiar with its through extortion of successful businesses extortion of money for protection rackets or what have you insisting that a cell phone business for example give them a cut of their profits or theyll blow the cell phones down cell phone towers down taking a cut out of the cement business the real estate business the financial businesses and so forth
5925429 their extortion campaign demanding that businesses pay protection money to avoid being attacked
5925430 to control cell phone use has quickly evolved into just another extortion campaign
5925431 the cell phone service in order to stay in touch with friends family and the few government services that are available
5925432 demanded that night service be restored it was but then noting that there were several cell phone companies operating in southern afghanistan the taliban went to the different companies and offered not only protection but damage to a competitor for a price
5925433 i think letting your haircut hang out there is a spiritual exercise because it requires patience and a certain loss of self control and a measure of mastery and discipline
5925434 i can only confirm the b sample test has come positive but the results of both tests are different which is strange to us
5925435 they took my urine samples at the same time in the ipl and the tests have shown up different results
5925436 ok tovarich doy mi visto bueno al escudo de hecho me gusta tanto el proyecto que voy a colaborar colocando tooodos estos pepinos en cuba pero es para protegerte de iran no pienses mal eh
5925437 i can only confirm the b sample test has come positive but the results of both tests are different which is strange to us
5925438 they took my urine samples at the same time in the ipl and the tests have shown up different results
5925439 its the place to be when you are visiting taylor texas
5925440 what can i say that no one else has already mentioned i travel from town to town in texas and have always found a special spot in each town in taylor this is the spot
5925441 its appetizing to watch brisket sliced to order on one of the ancient cutting blocks
5925442 the fatty brisket at the lower right is simply as good as barbecued brisket gets thats lean brisket towards the upper left and the two are separated by a link of chipotle sausage
5925443 it has long been a tradition for customers to tack their business cards to louie muellers wall some of these look like theyve been here since texas was a republic
5925444 the blackened crust of the brisket packs a tastebud wallop of smoke and salt and coarse pepper
5925445 succulence incarnate there is no meat more luscious than louie muellers brisket
5925446 what looks like a stained glass window in a cathedral of barbecue is actually a skylight in the roof thats been stained by years of pit smoke
5925447 in our opinion the hot sauce set out on louie muellers tables is superfluous the meat is self sufficient on the other hand toothpicks are a necessity
5925448 2nd street in taylor still has its old raised sidewalks
5925449 a meditative setting in which to eat thought provoking meat
5925450 the meat inside a muellers hot link is soft and tender but the casing is plenty chewy look what happened to the plastic fork i tried to use to separate a hunk
5925451 they will definitely come back strongly they have a very good side and a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5925452 the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards
5925453 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century

5925455 the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards

5925457 after the event in jaipur we ran a background check on hussain it revealed serious discrepancies which led to severance of our relationship with him this is normal action taken we have no other comments to offer
5925458 their attitude is aggressive and heartless and comes from a communal tendency
5925459 we admire this mans courage rashid has decided to fight against this injustice
5925460 if theyre uneducated theyre portrayed as easy recruits as terrorists and if theyre educated theyre portrayed as dangerous because they may have skills to engage in terror activities

5925463 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5925464 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5925465 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5925466 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5925467 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5925468 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5925469 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5925470 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5925471 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5925472 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

5925477 how do we make the institute a place for intergenerational dialogue

5925489 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5925490 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5925491 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5925492 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5925493 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5925494 if the stocks drop i expect crude prices to rise but it will be within the 118 120 a barrel range if the stocks increase or are flat i expect prices to be around the 112 113 a barrel level
5925495 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel

5925502 hey this is my show and this is what were going to do
5925503 just because you put students in groups doesnt mean theyll work as a team
5925504 in addition to areas under public storm signal 2 and 3 classes in the elementary and secondary levels are suspended wednesday in la union pangasinan zambales tarlac bataan pampanga and bulacan
5925505 these winds are very dangerous this could generate a tornado especially in ilocos norte and ilocos sur
5925506 were really excited about the tour the dates are quite spread out but we do have a good dozen shows or so on the bill were going everywhere we can
5925507 were really looking forward to being back on the road and seeing all our fans again
5925508 that was one of the main reasons for touring the last two tours we did were all over aged shows and following that we were inundated with messages from our under aged contingent who were wondering if they would ever be able to see us
5925509 mind you they get pretty cranky about not being able to see you and they arent afraid to let you know it but its great to know that they are out there and that they love you
5925510 i admit it its going to be tough but were going to love every minute of it i must admit weve only actually performed sing the news once we were supporting shihad got ourselves really loaded up and thought it was a good idea to perform it
5925511 boy were we wrong trust me well have it good and ready for the tour its all about our fans coming along and having fun a good performance will help
5925512 we actually set out with 12 tracks i know other bands often have a lot of music and ideas behind an album but songwriting is a difficult process for us basically we all have to agree on the final product there are debates tension and arguments when were not on the same page
5925513 of course but it means that were incredibly proud of the finished result were an honest band nerdy upbeat realists but definitely honest and we believe our music should reflect that so we work hard to achieve that
5925514 well because were down a drummer at the moment we wanted a video that focused on the two of us why not a competing video
5925515 i mean it took us three days but its a pretty awesome clip the stunts made us look so cool but they were performed by professionals
5925516 several witnesses saw it and their descriptions were the same said joe stattelman department of natural resources conservation officer
5925517 its smaller than a labrador retriever has dark long hair a slanted snout and visible white tusks it sounds like a wild pig to us
5925518 they root up vegetation they literally tear up the woods opening it up to erosion they can damage habitat for deer turkey and ruffed grouse and affect other wildlife he said theyll also eat and destroy crops and gardens
5925519 we have to be aggressive if someone doesnt kill it very soon well be putting out an alert to hunters he said
5925520 we would ask that if someone kills it that they please call us officials want to send it to the university of minnesotas veterinary diagnostic lab in st paul to be tested for various diseases including pseudo rabies brucellosis and tuberculosis
5925521 we dont want a whole bunch of wild pigs running around

5925527 we want to make sure we get every student thats eligible
5925528 our main thing is that with rising tuition that students know about as many financial aid possibilities as they can thats critical
5925529 like any new program it takes time to catch on
5925530 if we didnt have to scan the room for that stuff we could go further with student learning
5925531 its not a huge issue but it happens throughout the year
5925532 i wouldnt be surprised if every school district in the state banned them
5925533 what im seeing lately is that parents are giving them to kids for safety reasons
5925534 weve had parents call kids during the school day and kids call their parents from out on the playground
5925535 we understand its the time and age of cell phones
5925536 i only have a cell phone not a landline but youre not going to have it ringing in class with you
5925537 it was by far the biggest behavioral thing we dealt with last year
5925538 im glad its not 114 knives or weapons but they are just a nuisance it is just constant
5925539 breasts need to be covered no sagging pants no short shorts
5925540 i know everyone wears hoodies today but its a way for kids to hide they try to retreat in there
5925541 parents can help by supporting the school and supporting the teachers and encouraging students to not bring or wear these items to school
5925542 and if it gets confiscated dont get upset about it
5925543 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program

5925550 was the kind of guy you wanted to room with not fly with he was reckless and thats critical when you start thinking about whos going to be the president
5925551 but the navy accident rate was cut in half the day john mccain was shot down
5925552 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

5925557 lunch should not be skipped for both employee health and productivity
5925558 workers are worried about what people will say if they take too long on their break
5925559 the biggest thing employers can do for productivity is encourage lunch workers tend to have a lot more energy if they take a break meaning theyre more on the ball for the afternoon stretch
5925560 you will find youre getting more work done than if you didnt break at all
5925561 workers tend to go home feeling energised and are less likely to lounge around and snack if theyve had a boost in the middle of the day
5925562 employees need to make more proactive choices when it comes to lunch and taking breaks in the office
5925563 employers need to lead by example and get out of the office at lunch
5925564 i just moved here and so its a little scary
5925565 i just got a job here so im working here so now i would probably think twice before i go out of the house myself at night
5925566 i know the cops are out there but they really have to be really really out there
5925567 find out whos doing it find out the people thatve done it previously theyre out its summer its hot theres parks theres schools they have to be constantly in schoolyards parks all over
5925568 its not a good thing they should have police all over
5925569 they have to catch him and let him be in jail for the rest of his life
5925570 i am deeply concerned about the two borough park abductions which have now been tied to the same assailant
5925571 already shaken by the recent assault this will make residents even more anxious about the safety of our children this is a community with a lot of children and they must be protected the nypd is to be commended for the significant resources they have committed to capturing this perpetrator

5925578 ive had 18 straight whiskies i think thats the record
5925579 the poet arrives at the unknown and even if half crazed in the end he loses the understanding of his visions he has seen them let him be destroyed in his leap by those unnamable unutterable and innumerable things there will come other horrible workers they will begin at the horizons where he has succumbed
5925580 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business

5925588 what else were we going to do all of these athletes were waiting for us in the airport probably wondering where we were and couldnt get on the plane without us
5925589 we were responsible for teams from across canada coast to coast as well as their coaches and chaperones
5925590 its been such a good experience and a lot of fun
5925591 but its a huge responsibility people trust the legion with their children and we watch over them
5925592 over 20 years weve see a lot of young people grow mature move on in great directions
5925593 weve met an amazing group of people and great athletes across the country they might not have all gone to the olympics but i think its really shaped a lot of lives
5925594 so many emotions 20 years is a long time well miss it so much even though we said it was time
5925595 leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia moore had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program

5925602 i want to know how they make their hives are they deep hives are they small hives or do they have a tendency to form super colonies and super colonies are bad things
5925603 you could pick up a handful of workers from one end of a super colony and drive a couple of klicks to the other end of the super colony theyre incorporated theyre not killed
5925604 now theyre starting to take off because now the weather here is the same as where they would have come from in europe so youve got all of these side things
5925605 if we dont get a handle on this theyll be all through new glasgow all of pictou county and it wont take long
5925606 catholics should vote for me because i share their values i am proud of my 25 year pro life record in the congress i oppose partial birth abortion and support the reversal of roe v wade i will make the eradication of poverty which ensnares over 36 million americans a top priority of the mccain administration i am proud of my longstanding commitment to conserving americas natural resources and promoting environmental stewardship i believe we can and must provide access to health care for every american and i have plans to make health care more portable and affordable with generous tax credits finally i believe it is possible in our time to make the world we live in another better more peaceful place where our interests and those of our allies are more secure and american ideals that are transforming the world the principles of free people and free markets advance even farther than they have
5925607 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5925608 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5925609 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5925610 the enemy is withdrawing and were conducting pursuit and blocking operations
5925611 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
5925612 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5925613 when my mum had gone we needed money to buy electricity dog food stuff like that really
5925614 it wasnt like i was doing it for the glitz and glamour for the big watch the big chain trying to be like rapper 50 cent it was because i needed that to live
5925615 i wished that i didnt have to do it that i didnt have to go through the stress the aggro the looking over my back every two minutes
5925616 i would have rather have stuck in school or gone to college or just have got help from somewhere really

5925626 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5925627 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene

5925630 russia must cope with a rate of population decline that has no historical precedent in the absence of pandemic
5925631 the influence of the united states within the developed world will likely rise
5925632 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5925633 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5925634 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5925635 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5925636 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5925637 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5925638 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5925639 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5925640 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5925641 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5925642 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5925643 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5925644 les gens ont le droit daimer a tout le monde ne pense pas comme toi etc etc
5925645 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5925646 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5925647 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5925648 dozens of people from the shia community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5925649 what we are seeing is no change in the pakistan government policies after musharraf
5925650 we want the government to change its policies this is not a sectarian attack we take its responsibility

5925653 a child i see for a child you are even wise beyond your years you have so much you have yet to learn and many childish fears no you did not harm her for the girl was free to choose you know shes always loved you just as you have loved her too
5925654 so its a bit like your name affects me she feels drawn to me
5925655 oh aida im so sorry you must know i love you too
5925656 you promised that you would not and i know you never will im happy for you and the girl she is beautiful and loves you as truly as i do you ask if she had a choice to love you i dont think she did you are so very beautiful even when compared to another great beauty such as she the love i have for you is different it is not lessened by her love for you or that you return in kind
5925657 we are closer than you can be with most of your human friends i will always feel what you do as you will grow to feel me too i would simply wish that i could hold you as the girl does also i had no choice at all i loved you the moment i saw you
5925658 perhaps it is strange and different for you but you do know i love you too
5925659 you always were such a beautiful horse and im so glad youve come to say hello
5925660 i was hoping youd still be here because i found something down in the village you might like
5925661 its one of the first apples of the fall harvest bayford i ate one and so did father and i can tell you they are very sweet
5925662 that is called lellala it is not of much use but it has a waxy substance that we find useful to make hair shiny you already know two herbs that are better
5925663 i thought that you greater fairies grew bigger over time
5925664 there are many rules in life syna none of them are without exceptions he has always been very small but he is very beautiful too he also knows the forest as well as any and is eyes are very keen
5925665 the little ones also love him because he is so pretty he looks after them and helps to keep them out of trouble they just naturally listen to him as well as they do our eldest sister
5925666 i think also that he is perhaps the cleverest of all the fairies
5925667 he learns new songs easier than most and remembers them longer than all but a few he says very little but i do not believe there are many things so small that his eyes do not see
5925668 it is good to remember especially with the little ones it only takes a little which is easier to use with children and it burns quite a bit less than the root youve been using you can mix either with cool water which helps but the root is not very pleasant if you get it in the eyes or nose when it is fresh
5925669 we will look to the south of the valley tomorrow
5925670 there are some warm cliffs that face the sun and some might still be awake
5925671 arent you afraid that i might think you are a bee or something and that i might swat you when you do that
5925672 do not think you are so quick child besides you always know it is me and i dont look at all like a bee
5925673 to the south across the great ocean there are lands there that have forests so vast that if a fairy were to fly as fast as he could from sunup to sundown he would not reach the mountains there for a full seven days those forests have many more useful things in them than the forests here do it is unfortunate that we can not go there
5925674 it sounds like that forest was as large as my whole kingdom i would love to see it someday
5925675 in truth if you were to hide your little kingdom in that forest even we fairies would have to look very hard to find it again it is as vast as any but the oceans themselves
5925676 would it ever be possible for me to see these wonders
5925677 well how does asho or the aida for that matter cross the great oceans
5925678 did you find all that you were looking for today
5925679 yes and more besides we will have to look farther to the south when you are more rested
5925680 it is normal to be so tired syna before the last of the leaves have left the trees it will be as if it never was it should not worry you the herbs will help a great deal
5925681 my heart tells me that you are copper eyes too
5925682 ive wondered about my memory i know that fairies sang their learning songs while i slept i remember things that i dont think i should remember there are other things that i should remember that seem unclear
5925683 the sleep of the ancients affects memory syna you know this
5925684 what you do not know is that you are more susceptible than any other when you first came into contact with the ancient one we intended you to come to know him more slowly but he pulled you from the cliff
5925685 he was fearful syna he feared for the little ones for himself and mostly for you had you not been as pure of heart and as pure of essence it would have destroyed you you slept for a very long time as your true self was revealed as for the herbs
5925686 i did not feel it was necessary for you to feel any more pain or fear than you needed to the eldest whispered that you had always been a female which you truly are
5925687 there is so much what if i make a mistake
5925688 you do not know it but you remember the learning songs even more quickly than my sire you have heard a great many more of them than you know
5925689 you need not be it is because of your doubt
5925690 that asho chose this path for you do you want me to find the eldest she is very good at speaking the human tongue
5925691 no need to have her fly such a long way
5925692 syna neither the ancient one nor i made you a healer
5925693 you already had those gifts and only needed the knowledge
5925694 you knew the problems with the old man and the woman
5925695 the old man was not easy from what you described i would still ask you this what would you have done if you did not know what it was what if your heart did not tell you how he was sick or your mind did not tell you how to cure him
5925696 i dont know id try to help where i could id try to ease his pain at least
5925697 i suppose id do what i could to make him comfortable then id probably try and find you
5925698 this is a great burden for you he knows but it was necessary this knowledge is needed by men and it will help to keep you safe it is sad that you are so young but whether you are young or old there will be many illnesses you cannot cure i can help greatly but there is much that i cannot do it will always be that way
5925699 i can see why aida likes it when you laugh syna dont concern yourself too much most of the time you will be able to help
5925700 was there more of what my sister told you that troubled you
5925701 well to be honest this thing about being a princess and having suitable female mate and also having my essence passed through all the families of man through my children
5925702 i do not have a mate but i have seen many who do i do not think that such choices are as much a thing of worry as they are a thing of wonder you are very special you will know the worth of those worthy of your love as with the girl it is not a thing should worry you some things just are and you will know them when they come to be
5925703 i thought you would be getting things ready to begin the harvest tomorrow is everything well
5925704 it is syna we walked the fields with keene and several of the other men and we decided that we would wait till the moon is full some of the other men will pick their fruits and vegetables first and then they will be free to help us gather in this part of the valley
5925705 father they didnt let uncle walk all this way again did they
5925706 no syna chandi was in the village with the dray cart and dara asked her to give him a ride well from what chandi said she ordered her to do it
5925707 i dont think any of the village women are going to let him get out of the village again unescorted for a while mind you keene is very fast on his feet for a man of his years
5925708 are you two hungry father i can make you something to eat i have some stew on the warming fire and im sure its ready
5925709 we are fine we ate some of the fruit in carols orchard when we were down by the river and his wife gave us some meat rolls unless you ladd
5925710 im hungry father so if you dont mind ill eat a little would you like a cool drink ladd
5925711 keene thinks that i should consider letting you take over the cottage to our north and that it would be better for you as a healer and better for the people to know that you had a place of your own
5925712 i know that syna he has been worried he thinks that it would be better for them to see that you are a grown woman
5925713 father you can tell him that i am not leaving you again im going to stay and take care of you i know he means well but i think he is getting old if he thinks that is a good idea
5925714 syna i told him that you were far safer with me and that you would want to stay with me for now even so dont think that hes not thought about this the man thinks of ten things before he says one he makes a lot of good arguments the people may not think it yet but i am sure he is right that the people of the valley will more likely see you as a healer if they see you as a woman living alone would do that
5925715 he also thinks you may need more privacy because you are as hard as it is to say it a mature young woman now syna im against it myself but dont think that our elder has not thought this through
5925716 i hear things the people of the village are good folk they mean you no harm but i hear things that your father does not the people are worried they dont understand and you frighten them a little
5925717 im sorry girl perhaps frightened is a little too strong but they are worried the elder hears many more of these worries than you or your father will they have heard you can heal but they think of you as a child most as a boy who has been odd all his life they believe dara and keene and calum and me when we tell them that there has never been any harm in you but they need help keene has already convinced the smith and me that this is for the best
5925718 i think hes convinced you too bryan dara as well although shes said less about the reasons why she agrees than even you have
5925719 im sorry ladd but there was an accident and your woman was injured
5925720 the boy who works for the baker was lifting a weight of flour from the cart the tackle broke and when it fell upon the dray the axle gave way your wife was guiding the cart holding the reins and backing the horse when it fell she was pinned
5925721 yes we must hurry syna they have freed her and are taking her to the inn you must come
5925722 we must hurry but dont worry he is very sure footed
5925723 is that some trick you taught him while wooing ladies at the court jada
5925724 they got her out but the bone in her leg had either stuck through the skin or she had cut her leg
5925725 the elder is making them wait for you she is in a great pain
5925726 why dont you send for help ive lost my leg ive lost it
5925727 please try to lay still ill help you but i have to look at your leg try to lay still

5925750 calum when i tell you i need you to pull her ankle down and away and by all thats holy keep her foot straight ladd you hold her under her arms try not to let her slide everyone else give us light please
5925751 there is no such thing as magic mushrooms live on the dead things in the forest right
5925752 do mushrooms grow mixed in all kinds together or does one kind usually grow together on its own
5925753 mushrooms have smells and flavors that drive back other mushrooms they do it so that they have more to eat animals mark to signal others of their kind little squirrels hide nuts near females nests so that the will come closer is any of that magic
5925754 i dont believe in magic lessa there is no such thing
5925755 i wont cause any problems grandfather i promise i wont cause problems
5925756 ive never told anyone that i was a wise man it took me many years to figure out that most problems between people take care of themselves better if you do nothing ive made many mistakes large and small and ive tried my very best to correct those that i could all ive ever promised anyone was that i hope im a little wiser now than i was
5925757 keely you have no need to fear anything from me child i have loved three generations of children in this valley each more so than the one before i could never do anything to harm any of you
5925758 no one will try to take syna away from you child not while i have breath left in my body
5925759 i only hope when you have my job bryan youll be better at it than i was im sad to say thats the only part of it that wont be too hard on you i promise you nothing comes without a cost and a thing that is truly worthwhile can have a terrible price indeed
5925760 we have peace in our valley without the upset we had over this we have two beautiful children we never would have ladd has a good woman who works as hard as any man does he loves her and she loves him as well in her own way
5925761 and ive not had a single day in ten years that i did not think of they way that poor tortured soul looks at me all because i interfered thinking that i did the right thing if im called upon to answer for that well even after all this time i have none none at all
5925762 when i replace you id never have your job jared
5925763 you will and im sorry for you all because you are a good man and will want to help
5925764 and when in your senile dotage did you decide that
5925765 yes seven do you remember when you watched that old man sneaking into old bransons barn to steal an egg
5925766 i thought so well i know you saw him because i saw you both yet you never told me you never told anyone that i know of you saved that poor old hungry man from trouble even when i asked you several times
5925767 you did as far as i know its the only time you ever lied to anyone and yet you had the sense to know which was the greater wrong old branson had two hundred chickens in that barn he would have seen the poor wretch in the stocks for just one lousy egg
5925768 when i knew you were safe i searched the head of the valley again and into the hills beyond i followed the road as far as the next village along the south road
5925769 you dont need to look for me any longer jada im here now
5925770 i was not searching for you this time i was searching for those that helped you
5925771 i wont but ill have to report to the chancellor that i did so he would never accept that i did not search ill also tell him that i found nothing
5925772 ill tell him the truth syna i would not lie to him to save my very life that is my oath i would however rather give that life willingly than to endanger yours it is far better for everyone that i tell him these simple truths
5925773 ill tell the truth at least as much as they need to know i have only to ask you this one small thing and it is all i will ever require of you do the folk who helped you in the wood pose any danger to the people of this kingdom
5925774 they only mean good for everyone they are a great hope jada i think i understand that now but they are far more important than anyone could realize and they do none harm
5925775 there are ugly things out in the rest of the world syna
5925776 i will have to go back in a few days time
5925777 i know that girl is very special i can see that clearly but even if she were not so i believe that i would ask you to remain here in this valley that will be safest for all and i could not bear any harm to come to you
5925778 i will not leave this valley jada i belong here
5925779 youve already looked for me for many days already havent you
5925780 twenty years before you disappeared on me after that i searched for you in every hour that the sun shone and in any hour that had any but the least moonlight
5925781 sir balderdash how many times must i speak to you on this point of your table manners
5925782 if you simply must go on doing that will you please learn to use your napkin before kissing people with your overly large and monstrously slimy snout ulmph ga nagh
5925783 we will speak more later i think mr balderdash needs your attention more than i do right now and i have to go and check on chandi
5925784 you should rest now ill be right here to watch over you
5925785 i didnt mean i just loved her it hurt when they separated

5925856 they caused the problem and they should pay for their errors
5925857 it was never my responsibility to make sure their equipment was running properly
5925858 however six months of back billing in the absence of any further public service commission action will result in 621 000 remaining uncollected from the under billed customers
5925859 this amount would eventually be paid by questars other customers however about 98 000 that is at risk to questar would remain uncollected and be a loss to the company
5925860 we agree with the report to the extent that it indicates the company has done everything it can to resolve this problem
5925861 this really looks like it is shaping up to be a six month back billing issue or a 24 month issue
5925862 i could understand if i owed money because of a billing error
5925863 but this had to do with their equipment not being checked to make sure it was operating properly
5925864 it is only fair that since county taxpayers contribute that money
5925865 they should have more input into how that money is spent

5925869 i went back home with my family and called ted and said look this whole thing is moving too quickly purnell said
5925870 at that point and i think its a great example of his style he said hey take all the time you need because youre the guy we want
5925871 we thought about it that day long and hard and called back and said were coming out to look at it if we really like it well probably accept the job
5925872 that was probably the most professionally satisfying period of time in my career i was so locked in i played competitive tennis and every athlete knows of a time when youre just in a zone during that period of a week or so i was so locked in and completely focused it was so energizing and so engaging
5925873 teds the only guy ive ever worked for who at the end of the year and sometime in the middle of the year in an unofficial way would ask what barriers do we have to remove going forward to help us to win as a coach thats like music to your ears weve done this and that and that but what do we need the first time i heard that i was almost startled
5925874 if you evaluate leadership by the performance of the people under his watch hes done just an unbelievable job
5925875 the success on the fields and courts of his teams the success of the student athletes in the classroom the impact athletes and coaches have made in the community its a dramatic change and its all come under teds leadership
5925876 he understands what it means to be a student here he understands what it means to compete here and what it takes to be successful
5925877 hes been involved in every aspect ive worked very closely with him over the last two years as ted said hes got the job inside and out he knows exactly what the next steps are and hes ready to make them i think hes been well prepared for that job
5925878 i appreciate the opportunities kissell had given me over the years to be involved in every facet
5925879 as excited as i am personally about this the other piece of this is that its a lot of great work by our coaches our staff and the administration
5925880 hes been right there on teds hip he has seen it all and he has done it all
5925881 tim has been all the way around the organization he has the confidence of the campus and the community that knows him
5925882 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5925883 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5925884 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5925885 oh that score is too high that is not fair
5925886 we havent said this a lot but the judges they got this one right
5925887 what are the benefits of your breaking that window many you calm yourself down the enclosure gets lighter and cooler the poisons rise a little off the floor the intensity lessens and the people you are looking for have a little more time for you to find them
5925888 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country

5925892 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
5925893 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them gt
5925894 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5925895 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems

5925922 we fought as most brothers did usually over vital issues like who had to sit in the back of the impala but neither of us ever sent the other to the emergency room so i guess we really did love each other blood is thicker than blood
5925923 with the success of the war in iraq and the collapse of the hussein regime the united states stands at the crossroads of opportunity and risk the opportunity is to help iraq build a peaceful decent representative and forward looking government and society that will encourage the process of modernization and reform throughout the region the world the region the united states and the iraqi people are more secure now that the menace of saddam husseins regime has been removed if we proceed wisely we can help iraqis achieve freedom build a more democratic middle east secure arab israeli peace and reverse the regional forces of extremism and terrorism the risk is that we will either execute poorly and depart prematurely allowing post war iraq to descend into chaos and instability or overreach and be heavy handed in iraq or the region creating a backlash against the united states and advancing the forces of islamic radicalism
5925924 the united states must stay the course in post hussein iraq
5925925 us exit strategy should be driven by these objectives and realities on the ground not by artificial or predetermined timelines
5925926 operational pressures to redeploy the u s military to other missions will build over time and mounting costs of the operation both human and financial may decrease domestic political support the administrations long standing aversion to nation building may reassert itself over time increasing the temptation to declare victory before victory is actually achieved but the downsides of pulling out of iraq before achieving our post conflict objectives would be even greater incalculable damage to u s credibility and future u s initiatives in the region and globally the increased likelihood of islamic radicalism becoming a powerful force in iraqi society and increased probability of long term instability in iraq and potentially the broader region

5925982 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
5925983 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
5925984 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
5925985 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
5925986 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating

5926003 were starting to see evidence that chinese exports of freight intensive goods are beginning to slow under the pressure of rapidly rising transport costs
5926004 if energy prices remain elevated and we believe they will there is a clear possibility that you will see more and more industries leaving china its a slow and gradual process and it will have a significant impact on specific industries
5926005 the same argument can be made for us companies to produce goods in countries that are competing with china and are closer to north america for instance mexico can compete with china in furniture manufacture and it seems that american importers are starting to do the math and are shifting some business from china to mexico
5926006 soaring transport costs suggest trade should be both dampened and diverted as markets seek shorter and hence less costly supply lines instead of finding cheap labour halfway across the world the key will be to find the cheapest labour force within reasonable shipping distance to your market

5926011 but when they are the world is no longer flat
5926012 we believe that oil prices will remain elevated and in fact go higher again
5926013 its not a question of tomorrow its a long term story we believe theres a major disagreement between supply and demand therefore energy prices will remain elevated and go higher which in turn means transport prices will become more and important for companies

5926081 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
5926082 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly
5926083 few interventions have been proved to substantially help patients with chronic back pain in the longer term
5926084 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination the practice and theory of the technique support the hypothesis that it could potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
5926085 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5926086 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5926087 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5926088 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5926089 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions says dr fauci
5926090 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5926091 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5926092 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5926093 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5926094 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5926095 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5926096 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5926097 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5926098 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
5926099 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
5926100 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
5926101 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5926102 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5926103 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5926104 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5926105 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001
5926106 this suggests that the steric occlusion model best explains the available biochemical and structural evidence that has been published

5926113 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown
5926114 the strength in the dollar index has little to do with dollar strength but more the weakness of the other currencies

5926116 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity

5926120 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5926121 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5926122 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5926123 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5926124 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5926125 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5926126 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5926127 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5926128 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5926129 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5926130 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5926131 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5926132 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5926133 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5926134 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5926135 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5926136 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5926137 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5926138 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5926139 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5926140 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5926141 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5926142 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5926143 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5926144 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5926145 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5926146 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5926147 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5926148 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5926149 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5926150 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5926151 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5926152 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5926153 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5926154 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5926155 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5926156 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5926157 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5926158 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5926159 its training and leading up to a race for me
5926160 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5926161 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5926162 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5926163 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5926164 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5926165 an empowering new twist on a girls coming of age
5926166 debut author kuehnert keeps the story raw and gritty the intensity of the characters emotions and experiences will beguile many teen readers
5926167 i wanna be your joey ramone is a manifesto for defiant high school girls as well as a refresher course for the goddesses they turn into
5926168 emilys coming of age story in i wanna be your joey ramone is allusive real and honest even i the most non rock oriented teen in existence found it overwhelmingly easy to connect with and relate to emily it makes no difference if youre a punk rock chick or a glam princess i would recommend this book to any elle girl
5926169 this book could be any real bands behind the music but kuehnert creates some realistic characters that drag you down past reading it on the shitter congrats steph you got me to read a whole fucking book for once solid writing ms lady
5926170 umm i think my agent might have sold my book so im going to go some place quiet to call her
5926171 weve done a lot of work over the past 18 months
5926172 clearly customers have embraced this agreement and given us strong feedback and completely support the approach weve taken
5926173 they just wanted microsoft and novell to provide what we call a covenant not to sue
5926174 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5926175 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5926176 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5926177 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5926178 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5926179 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5926180 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5926181 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5926182 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5926183 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5926184 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
5926185 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
5926186 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5926187 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5926188 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5926189 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5926190 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5926191 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5926192 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5926193 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5926194 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5926195 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5926196 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5926197 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5926198 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5926199 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5926203 der gef llte ranzen sollte am ende nicht mehr als zehn prozent des k rpergewichts des kindes wiegen
5926204 im durchschnitt hatte jeder ranzen ein gewicht das bei 17 2 prozent des k rpergewichts der kinder lag
5926205 das ist die nat rliche reaktion darauf dass sich durch den ranzen der k rperschwerpunkt etwas nach hinten verschiebt
5926206 selbst ein schwererer ranzen wird eine gesunde kindliche wirbels ule nicht sch digen dazu wirkt das gewicht viel zu kurz auf den r cken ein
5926207 selbst bei schlaffer muskulatur wirkt ein ranzen zu kurz auf den r cken ein um die passiven strukturen wie wirbelbogen gelenke b nder und bandscheiben sch digen zu k nnen
5926208 die empfehlung von zehn prozent stammt aus der zeit vor dem ersten weltkrieg sie bezog sich darauf wie schwer der tornister eines rekruten sein durfte damit bei langzeitbelastungen keine muskul ren erm dungen auftraten
5926209 diesen wert auf ranzen und schulkinder anzuwenden ist v llig unrealistisch
5926210 es gibt zudem keinen einzigen beleg daf r dass der r cken eines kindes gesch digt wird wenn es einen schwereren schulranzen tr gt

5926213 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5926214 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5926215 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5926216 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5926217 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5926218 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5926219 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5926220 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
5926221 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5926222 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5926223 when things are going smoothly its easy to run but when you have a defeat or people arent playing its my responsibility to keep these players happy and keep things moving forward
5926224 this is tougher for me as i have been through four rounds of the 100m and this is the first time ive had to do eight rounds in a championships
5926225 im feeling it but i feel like ive got one run left in me
5926226 hes within thousandths of a second every lap and hes one of the fastest cars here its over and above what we were asking for
5926227 nascar called me and we talked about it and they said set him up
5926228 and i think after today nascar wont have a problem approving him for dover
5926229 im real happy the way everything has gone so far
5926230 getting comfortable with the track and the car were my goals i think its good that ive never been here before so i didnt know what to expect i think that kinda helped me
5926231 weve always had good cars here but it still takes a good man to get it within thousandths every lap joes getting it done
5926232 just as soon as he hit the track in his first run he ran a 31 60 on old tires
5926233 last september i was a fan here its just awesome to get an opportunity like this i look at this as my big chance
5926234 this tragedy is not over yet we understand that but today is a celebration
5926235 as we look around we see how one person can affect so many lives
5926236 so many are affected by the choice of another we share the power of forgiveness even when it seems impossible
5926237 in a lot of ways he was one of us
5926238 the state believes that the defendant plans to introduce these items as well as the remains of a marijuana cigarette collected from reids truck at trial to suggest to the jury among other things that he was a violent and lawless person
5926239 reid could not therefore have used them to threaten the defendant or anyone else in the moments before the victim was killed
5926240 the logical relationship between marijuana possession and a violent character is tenuous at best
5926241 if she is alive shes not around here theres no question about that and if she is alive shed have another life
5926242 i was leaning against the counter and watched her cross the street she went down maple avenue and thats the last i saw of her
5926243 i believe some of the searches that theyre doing are not valid
5926244 as time goes on you dont think much of it because youve accepted certain things but theres always the thing in the back of your mind that shes out there
5926245 you cant just say oh lets increase the gas tax we need an overall look
5926246 if i get stopped it doesnt matter if its a cop or whoever it is if they try to stop me im going to shoot at them it doesnt matter
5926247 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5926248 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5926249 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5926250 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5926251 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5926252 practitioners can now go beyond therapy on the basis of ethnicity into the precisely targeted arena of personal genomics
5926253 remember its just a high school race game event its not the olympics
5926254 i think some people consider it to be morphine but it really isnt its stronger than morphine
5926255 as you know this occurred at a residence of bedford a party
5926256 we have as you all know seen a tremendous increase in deaths related to drugs
5926257 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5926258 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5926259 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5926260 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5926261 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5926262 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5926263 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5926264 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5926265 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5926266 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5926267 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5926268 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5926269 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5926270 we cant think that this assertion that they are freezing out small farmers could apply to us
5926271 transport costs form part of their the suppliers cost to us in the same way that our operating costs are included in the price to consumers
5926272 we kind of go out of our way to help small farmers
5926273 centralised distribution model allows us and suppliers to reduce transport costs
5926274 the location of the midrand distribution centre for example reduced kilometres travelled by suppliers to the facility by 7
5926275 presumably the distribution centres make economic sense to the corporate retailers but what they do not necessary reflect is the environmental cost of vast distances refrigerated trucks travel or the social costs of the market exclusion many small and emerging farmers suffer
5926276 extremely centralised and vertically integrated nature of corporate retail in south africa
5926277 most individual supermarket branches have very limited autonomy to source products locally they simply stock what the often distant corporate buyers decree most supermarkets are basically islands of corporate extraction largely disconnected from their surrounding communities except for the wages they pay particularly in historically impoverished areas they contribute very little to local multiplier effects their profits dont circulate locally instead they are swiftly repatriated to head offices in major urban centres
5926278 you small scale farmers dont get the prices your produce is worth if you supply locally you have to take what you can get and thats our problem
5926279 if you are a fresh line supplier you are saying you have the capacity to supply the western cape

5926284 we suspect that there have been other demands on treasury this could have been eskom and the world cup in 2010
5926285 during this financial year we lacked funds from the national treasury for new allocations but we have been looking at our budget request for next year to catch up on our initial target of 210 chairs by 2010

5926333 i finished writing it in nine months but the idea has been there for four years some of the stories in the novel are based on my own experience some others are from friends of mine
5926334 i left home because i had to work work and work there was no time for me to play but i later learned that being away from my parents made me even more unhappy
5926335 she is the one who discovered my writing talent she always boldly corrected me when i made mistakes
5926336 it will also help erase the negative stereotype that has always been attached to the domestic helper
5926337 the rising costs of energy and fuel are hitting the wall of every bostonian and the winter will be a particular challenge for many of us

5926339 i never thought casinos were a good economic plan for massachusetts but when revenue is tight and the budget is in crisis i can see it might be appealing
5926340 we believe that issue expanded gambling is going to be coming up very shortly again given the pressure of the economy and the jobs issue
5926341 from what i understand the jobs are overestimated i am going to give it a fair review
5926342 i am sure that fidelity understands the seriousness of this situation to its customers
5926343 i request that fidelity take immediate steps to resolve this matter on behalf of those customers
5926344 secondary dealers other primary dealers that arent part of the settlements are being investigated
5926345 it just seemed like this was the next logical step to create a service that would really use the power of the internet to help consumers shop smarter and without having to keep doing it over and over again
5926346 the heating season will be particularly surprising in a very negative way
5926347 that year the average massachusetts homeowner spent 1 600 to 1 700 to heat their home

5926364 several incidents of ipod nanos bursting into flames have created consumer jitters in gadget happy japan apple is downplaying the problem pointing out that no major injuries or damage have been reported the problem is due to defective batteries the company said and only a tiny percentage of the devices have caught on fire
5926365 i like that only a tiny percentage is anybody beginning to understand why i would prefer that these devices not be allowed on airplanes
5926366 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5926367 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5926368 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
5926369 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things

5926374 its either mom dad or a combination of the two
5926375 our parents are the ones that were our role models growing up
5926376 so we learned how to engage in relationships from them
5926377 remember this is the only window we have out into the world when we are growing up we couldnt just skip from family to family and see how different families did it because we only had just one
5926378 so we looked through this window and we said ok men act like this and women act like that so thats what it means to be in a relationship this is how they treated each other this is how they treated other people so in that way it is programmed in
5926379 whats interesting when were picking partners is that the person in front of us can look nothing like mom or dad
5926380 but if you dig a little deeper its there there are certainly going to be traits we see from our parents that we kind of gravitate to in people we date
5926381 the people that go from relationship to relationship do not pick someone different every time the way you think they would
5926382 they keep going back to those certain traits even though the person may have a totally different educational background standing in the community likes dislikes its still under there
5926383 its the qualities in the other person that get to the brain and say oh yes this is familiar i know this which then can lead to the physical attraction it just happens in seconds
5926384 it really depends on what unfinished business they have from the past
5926385 if the unfinished business is with mom then theyre going to find somebody and be attracted to someone who they think they can work that out with
5926386 were all wounded in childhood in some way so we figure that if we find someone who is the same type as the parents that gave us that wound and we can get that person to recognize us appreciate us love us then we prove our parents wrong
5926387 it wouldnt be what theyre arguing about in the bigger picture
5926388 theres something going on under the surface are they looking for approval are they looking to be in control are they looking to be a victim
5926389 so theres all these issues going on underneath that are really difficult for people to look at but underneath is really where all the answers lie when wanting happy healthy relationships
5926390 somebody wants to be in control because they were either out of control as a child or they were given too much control as a child
5926391 so theyre in a place where theyre very unhappy with their relationship
5926392 if somebody is trying to be the victim all the time thats not going to work unless the other partner makes them the victim all the time
5926393 if both people in the relationship are willing to work on it then it can be a really good healthy thing
5926394 i have couples that come in to my office who both do the work
5926395 they both look at their stuff and how they relate to each other and it turns out that they have the best relationships out there
5926396 because the improved relationships they have with a romantic partner are going to carry over into the relationships they have with their children with their parents with their friends with everything
5926397 if you meet somebody and theres that instant attraction turn around and run the other way
5926398 because what that means is that you have just met your past
5926399 yes lego has star wars and indiana jones but looking at retailer shelf space allocation going into the fall season were having excellent success
5926400 we think its a great magical play pattern theres a very high rate of consumer interest
5926401 i think it was relatively easy for mega brands to steal some of our market share in the past going forward thats going to be a lot more difficult
5926402 we got a wake up call we had become a little bit slow moving after 50 years of success
5926403 the opportunity for any company to come in and take away from our share now is much more difficult than 10 years ago those days are gone
5926404 the companies that are weathering these difficult times the best are those with consumer driven brands
5926405 mega brands biggest opportunity is to really start nurturing a more consumer oriented brand that can give them more insulation in times of trouble and also more leverage with retailers who have a lot more power these days

5926410 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
5926411 had the vegetation been adequately maintained the truck driver would have been able to clearly see the ghan stop and then proceed safely over the crossing when the train had passed

5926417 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb insp jaramazovic said

5926419 stocks are huge bargains relative to all other asset classes u s stocks now trade at 13x forward earnings for an almost 8 earnings yield while 10 year treasuries yield just 4 making equities the best bargain in more than 60 years
5926420 history also shows that even from a time standpoint both the bear and the economic downturn are getting into late innings
5926421 the markets topped out almost a year ago but bear markets are relatively short lived compared to bulls the average duration of bear markets over the last 50 years has been 8 months according to ned davis research on average bear markets bottom 4 months before recessions end and several months before earnings trough

5926426 you can say the man was still in his senses despite his injuries he couldnt speak but he communicated with gestures police captain herman ruben gab told telam news agency after he responded to an emergency call by the mans nephew who heard the shots
5926427 we did that reduced the staff for a reason she said in sydney today

5926430 although ahmed was deeply religious he was also 21 years old intelligent and had been interviewed by law enforcement twice before
5926431 there is nothing to suggest that ahmeds will was critically affected by the agents various appeals to his muslim beliefs and there is nothing inherently coercive about such tactics
5926432 we are very pleased with the courts thorough and well reasoned opinion rejecting defendant ahmeds motion to suppress the highly incriminating statements he made to the fbi
5926433 it makes no sense to conclude that a suspect has voluntarily given a statement to law enforcement officers when he has been promised he will not be arrested and left alone if he talks but will be arrested and prosecuted if he does not
5926434 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5926435 i want you to throw me up against that wall and do whatever you like however you like for as long as youd like until i say otherwise and i wont say otherwise
5926436 if im not back in 5 minutes just wait longer
5926437 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody ms lane said today in the perth magistrates court
5926438 i told the legislative leaders that it is extremely important not to leave until we have a budget done
5926439 we are two months past the constitutional deadline and i think it is inexcusable not to have a budget yet
5926440 we are still paying off debt that occurred from the 2003 budget disaster we had
5926441 the republicans want to go out and borrow more money before we have paid off our debt so i think that is not a good idea the key thing here is to stay focused and come up with a compromise
5926442 i dont want them to leave until the job is done anyone who says they do not want to compromise i do not think they are doing a service to the state of california and the people of california
5926443 i had a bit of a niggle in my back the whole session and thought it was nothing to worry about and then i sat in the car on the way back to the university and i could barely get back in the car
5926444 it was never a danger of stopping me from running because i was going to run no matter what
5926445 i walked out into that stadium and ive never ever been so pumped in my life
5926446 i was just really ready to go and i just got it right on the night
5926447 just being ahead of those girls at the start of the race was fantastic it was a great feeling
5926448 running out of the house yelling get em off me
5926449 the testing should be done before they put it down
5926450 from what we understand from what the health department has told us from what the experts have told us there is no reason to be concerned about this the greater risk really is kids not getting exercise in the fight against childhood obesity
5926451 the main event with the synthetic turf fields is allowing children adults athletes to get the maximum amount of use of the field
5926452 if we find that there is a public health risk well take the necessary steps after that
5926453 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5926454 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5926455 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5926456 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5926457 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5926458 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5926459 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time

5926466 video ringtones are a cool way to personalize your phone but its much cooler to get new vringos daily without having to work at it especially if youre a political junkie like me who loves to see the greatest show on earth the u s presidential election up close on your mobile phone
5926467 the business plan we work to is to increase our revenue by 15 per cent per year while decreasing our costs by around 12 per cent per year so that gradually were improving our margin by somewhere in the order of 2 per cent a year
5926468 we have a view that we can achieve a 20 per cent ebitda margin in three years which is about the industry standard for our software

5926472 has received multiple emmy nominations as well as hbos official site for the real time with
5926473 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5926474 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did
5926475 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5926476 we have concerns with every aspect of this tournament at the moment
5926477 it is what our security advisors describe as a presidential level of security what would be rolled out for any head of state that is visiting the country that is the extent of the measures we have in place
5926478 at this moment in time there is no discussion about a late move until members boards or participating teams clearly indicate their view as far as we are concerned the tournament will progress in pakistan
5926479 it is possible to postpone to relocate or to add a ninth or 10th team but at this point in time we have no indication to the contrary
5926480 the tournament is going ahead the teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate
5926481 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter the time frame the less likely that is of happening
5926482 its a complicated legal process something i cannot comment on at this point
5926483 i would like to think that the member boards would not send a weakened side because no life is worth less than another either you send your best side unless you decide the advice tells you differently
5926484 with all due respect these are people who have seriously studied a problem on their campus and they think this is a good solution to it we disagree
5926485 aside from alcoholism permitted we dont think its the answer to the problem of binge drinking
5926486 its kind of annoying when i go abroad and everything because ive been abroad a number of times but in the united states im 20 years old and i cant drink
5926487 lowering the drinking age would definitely help binge drinking because thats a huge problem these days i think the reason why its such a big problem is because of the drinking age
5926488 when you include someone like scotty west into the side itd give any team a boost so wed be wrapped to have him back and it looks like we wont have to wait too much longer
5926489 westys missed a lot of football since about round two or three
5926490 hes done all the training hes had some setbacks hes an old warhorse so we expect westy to come out and train today
5926491 in my heart i believe its a terrible terrible violation of my rights
5926492 its an equal rights issue that all victims are equally protected there shouldnt be special protection for special groups
5926493 the liberal states that have passed this type of legislation have had all types of real life circumstances that would scare oklahomans to speak freely on their views of moral issues
5926494 were not asking for special protection were only asking for equality thats why we need this law
5926495 we dont have an agenda we just need the wants and desires like everybody else in this world

5926500 im actually hopeful that shell be getting on court in the next game but im a lot more certain as far as the final goes
5926501 she has injured one of the two ligaments on the outside of her ankle
5926502 the great news is shes able to walk on it it doesnt even look like shell need an x ray and shes actually icing it back in the village now
5926503 at this stage its in the early point of her injury its ice compression elevation
5926504 well have a better idea tomorrow wednesday how shes going
5926505 pennys very confident of playing shes dying to get back out there and score some points
5926506 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5926507 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5926508 the plane was not yet full and it became apparent that people were refusing to board in the gate waiting area people had been talking about these two who looked really suspicious with their heavy clothing scruffy rough appearance and long hair
5926509 some of the older children who had seen the terror alert on television were starting to mutter things like those two look like theyre bombers
5926510 then a family stood up and walked off the aircraft they were joined by others about eight in all we learned later that six or seven people had refused to get on the plane
5926511 there was no fuss or panic people just calmly and quietly got off the plane there were no racist taunts or any remarks directed at the men
5926512 it was an eerie scene very quiet the children were starting to ask what was going on we tried to play it down
5926513 when the men were taken off they didnt argue or say a word they just picked up their coats and obeyed the police they seemed resigned to the fact they were under suspicion
5926514 the captain and crew were very apologetic when we were asked to evacuate the plane for the security search but there was no dissent
5926515 while we were waiting everyone agreed the men looked dodgy some passengers were very panicky and in tears there was a lot of talking about terrorists
5926516 thats it it may be a false alarm but im not going to bet my life on it or my childrens lives

5926525 im a survivor of hwy 154 because i live right on it
5926526 ive been trying to sell my house for the past 10 years at least
5926527 its time for this road and some common sense to be used to turn it commercial
5926528 youre going to have to loosen up on some of this stuff because its not residential anymore
5926529 most of the time in a residential setting you can have your kids out riding their bicycles and tricycles

5926532 well also be shooting the music video for crush which im nervous but excited about
5926533 everyone was patient this morning and that was nice to see
5926534 when i stopped at 6 40 a m it was backed up to exit 61 sr 74 senoia road but i later heard it was backed up to exit 56 collinsworth road i got to work at 9 10 a m and am usually at work by 7 30 a m
5926535 i heard about it on the radio around 6 a m
5926536 i decided to take the back way through peachtree city and fayetteville
5926537 we saw what we had to work with and lowered it a bit
5926538 if it gets crowded were going to have to shut down main street whether the store owners like it or not
5926539 so in effect we gain nothing by moving it as far as access to main street
5926540 i would love to have the cars parked on main
5926541 i would rather have the antique car parked in front of my store than for someone to park their car there to walk down the street to spend time and money
5926542 doesnt mean theyre going to spend money but it at least gives me a fighting chance
5926543 i think yall have been led to think the merchants dont want it and i dont believe thats true
5926544 it is a big day for us we are devastated
5926545 i want it like it was we want the street closed we think its safer i can just see kids getting hit
5926546 i thought the whole purpose of having these events was to bring people to our town not to put them on the back street
5926547 i quickly put together a petition which is very straightforward and went to any business that i could that was available
5926548 shutting down the street completely prohibits the people in the middle part of town from doing business
5926549 secondhand sams will have parking whether or not its closed so will miss sandy but the businesses in the heart of down are very much impacted by closing it down
5926550 it is a psychological effect to your clients to see a barricade
5926551 the vitriol and anger that comes from somebody having an opinion is really not conducive to community
5926552 very black and white theres nothing to read into it
5926553 so all youre doing is moving them from one place to another
5926554 this gives us an option to see if this venue works
5926555 my feeling is if we dont try any of this stuff youre never going to know
5926556 every year we try to think about it and try to figure out whats best for everybody
5926557 if we dont try this we dont know if it works or not
5926558 i dont feel like im where i need to be
5926559 my dad shouted so much that we thought there were lions in the house
5926560 we started this project off with selling bricks and i thought we were going to set the world on fire with bricks
5926561 one of the first things we all agreed on was to build a first class park that our community could be proud of
5926562 i see in the future some folks getting married down there
5926563 we are challenging you to match as much as you can
5926564 similar to what the city did and what you can afford to do for portions of this park
5926565 we feel that we have covered all the bases on this
5926566 it will be a beautiful site for everyone not for veterans only
5926567 were very proud of this and hope you will become a part of it
5926568 hay elementos de precedentes que permiten pensar que la controversia ser admitida porque ya se present una controversia as en baja california donde por materia presupuestal en una reforma que tiene que ver con el tribunal electoral fue admitida en la corte
5926569 los partidos y los coordinadores parlamentarios deben explicar por qu llevar a cinco veces m s el aumento para los partidos quiero que nos expliquen el fundamento social o econ mico o pol tico de esta decisi n a la sociedad de jalisco no le satisface y por eso el gobernador decide ir a una controversia
5926570 the downtown merchants have been suffering in sharpsburg since the first week of april and we havent had a whole lot of sympathy from the city im hoping business will pick up once they get the streets finished
5926571 we will not be allowed by the state to do the planned landscaping right now because of watering restrictions so things will be a little bare for a while
5926572 but we have a tree board that is actively engaged in fundraising for trees and ongoing tree maintenance
5926573 the town of sharpsburg will have a grand opening of streetscapes when the work is completed
5926574 we knew that the spring festival would have to be canceled
5926575 but we had no idea that the fall festival would have to be canceled as well
5926576 i can assure you everything possible will be done to see that there is a festival in the spring of 2009 and that it is a great success
5926577 we are already getting inquiries by email and phone calls from our web site about upcoming dates
5926578 as i understand it streetscapes was undertaken to upgrade the town
5926579 the hope is that it will bring more business to the area by create a warm country welcoming feeling
5926580 even if theyre not going to be done by aug 23 you would think they would be out here every day getting as much done as they possibly could
5926581 a couple of store keepers retired just before construction began on streetscapes a couple more moved to other locations
5926582 the remaining merchants have struggled but remain open awaiting our rebirth
5926583 it has been very frustrating for the merchants and we the council certainly sympathize with their plight
5926584 the old space did not quite become what i had envisioned
5926585 with the exception of polly garlington who has really stayed in touch with us weve really been on our own
5926586 and were going to do whatever we can to make that happen
5926587 the newspaper ran a wonderful story on the opening of the book nook and the monday after the story ran in the weekend paper the roads were closed
5926588 if i had known about the construction project i might not have chosen this location
5926589 a few weeks after i opened the streets were closed for initial construction
5926590 and then there was a lull in april in may followed by a change in contractor they got going again in late june and are still at it
5926591 the arbor day event will support our bid for designation as a tree city which would qualify us for additional grants
5926592 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5926593 the tables have been turned the persecuted in history have now become the persecutor
5926594 he made a commitment to be an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him he has been an exemplary citizen my dad has never hidden his name
5926595 ojibwa has a long history of families some families who attended school here their children come to school here grandchildren come to school here
5926596 ever since i was young we all went to ojibwa me and my brothers and sisters graduated from there and were excited about this new school so my children go to ojibwa now

5926599 everything is brand new its a new start for the kids a new start for the teachers everyones real excited to be here
5926600 they said youre not going to make it but we made it people we made it
5926601 im going to be standing out here looking at their faces when they see this grand entryway and thats going to make it all worthwhile
5926602 inevitably what happens is people get on the bike and dont realize how fast its going because youre used to the noise and having the sensory overload with the roar of the engine and you dont get that with this bike
5926603 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5926604 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5926605 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5926606 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5926607 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5926608 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5926609 todays early career professionals are used to an open and customizable online social networking experience but the information shared on many of those sites isnt always appropriate for a business audience
5926610 we created konnects to fill the gap between the experiences found on sites like facebook and linkedin our platform represents an opportunity for individuals and professionals to establish their own branded revenue generating online professional network
5926611 we want to impact pop cultures view of what makes a brand relevant green and positive
5926612 you can put on a t shirt and look good and feel good about what you bought it can be fun
5926613 joes made a big investment in branding rvl7 with a very modest product range
5926614 unlike most cases where youre just going out with a line of product
5926615 we are doing everything we can not to be stuck in that greenwash box
5926616 were trying to walk the walk not just talk the talk
5926617 sometimes we didnt its not really the same as last year
5926618 i dont know what it is but its a different feeling this year
5926619 the speed the intensity everybody is into it i can promise you that youre going to see a different defense than last year
5926620 has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
5926621 people have been talking about it you hear it here and there
5926622 im not going to respond to the comment but you can say it added fuel to the fire
5926623 im trying to set up plans for the future because with football you never know you could get hurt the very next play
5926624 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5926625 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5926626 eso no es m s que un peque o grupo de gente ocup ndose de cosas realmente intrascendentes muy sectario y con mucha exclusi n eso hay que cambiarlo
5926627 but i also like eating cake americans are a priveleged people why cant we have both i say we can and we should
5926628 i mean who wants to have a nice piece of cake and not be able to eat it terrorists do thats who are you a terrorist im not a terrorist i like cake
5926629 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5926630 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5926631 i think id like to reach 15 wins every year if possible
5926632 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5926633 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5926634 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5926635 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5926636 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5926637 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
5926638 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom
5926639 well i reckon i could knee him in the chest to make him let go
5926640 your antics are going to get us kicked off the wagon train simon
5926641 he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul
5926642 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
5926643 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
5926644 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
5926645 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
5926646 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
5926647 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
5926648 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
5926649 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
5926650 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
5926651 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
5926652 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
5926653 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
5926654 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
5926655 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
5926656 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
5926657 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
5926658 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
5926659 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
5926660 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
5926661 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
5926662 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
5926663 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir
5926664 i know a lady who runs a boardinghouse and is in need of some help
5926665 if youre an honest sort and not afraid of solid work you might do

5926670 the quack who did that to her was no doctor
5926671 he said hed take care of us but he turned nancy out within a week after last night he said id have to take her place
5926672 all the progressive forces in the society wanted immediate completion of this project
5926673 our rain harvesting facility has a capacity of 5 crore litres 50 million litres this could be the first amusement park with such a facility if rain fails we have wells to meet the water requirement
5926674 and basically was asking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance
5926675 i would suggest that he shouldnt be thinking at this stage that there should be only one thought in his head and thats the semifinal bout
5926676 i think we all know if he played the whole year woods would be
5926677 but if i was going to vote today i would probably vote for padraig because he won two majors
5926678 but to win more than one major in a year i would vote for padraig
5926679 winning both majors in the hardest conditions ive ever seen on both golf courses thats toughness defined right there and i think harrington has my vote
5926680 an 80 yard hook over the clubhouse from the trees with a restricted backswing
5926681 if he had any speed he wouldve made a double out of it

5926694 i pointed out that now he is the senior its his turn to lead the team

5926696 our hope is that when they step on the field they will be able to work as a unit
5926697 ive been looking forward to this since my sophomore year the opportunity for me to come up big for the team
5926698 corey flew under the radar last year as the third forward
5926699 he has always been a solid player but may not have gotten the recognition because hes always had such high profile players around him
5926700 i learned a lot from all of them because they taught me how to play the game fast on a high level
5926701 i try to be quick to the ball and aggressive
5926702 as a junior you think its not as hard as it really is but it is a big responsibility

5926712 theyre looking to make more putts get a little confidence
5926713 long short mediums ive got them all ive tried them all
5926714 ive had the same type of putter my entire career
5926715 i may change the grip on there every once in awhile but thats about as bizarre as i get
5926716 there are times when i switch putters for the look
5926717 but it was just too much practice to do both
5926718 youve got to show them the dark got to show them the closet
5926719 sometimes they are your best friend and sometimes they betray you
5926720 when they betray you you have to show them you can be replaced in a hurry

5926733 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5926734 when alexander saw the breadth of his domain he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer the suave villain from the first die hard film anonymous decided he should credit me for thorough annotation a the post title was a tongue in cheek way of acknowledging how b i am well aware that the quote actually belongs to and not a fictional character played by the great alan rickman c i wonder what sort of satisfaction commenting on a year old post about such a nonsensical thing brought his her sad life then again i do know that anonymous has so i decided to look at other recent posts to see if anything else needed to be clarified suck on that

5926926 false is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience that would take fire from men because it burns and water because one may drown in it that has no remedy for evils except destruction the laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature they disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity the most important of the code will respect the less important and arbitrary ones which can be violated with ease and impunity and which if strictly obeyed would put an end to personal liberty and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man they ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree

5926974 supplies were disrupted to the entire jammu and kashmir just not the valley
5926975 the state has 22 districts of which the 10 in jammu and two in the ladakh region were equally affected
5926976 around 2 800 trucks carrying essential commodities like fuel and medicine have come to the valley
5926977 around 3 300 fruit and vegetable laden trucks left the valley during the same period for different parts of north india
5926978 some disruption on the jammu srinagar national highway otherwise we used to get 1 000 trucks per day going to the valley
5926979 my vehicle was stoned and i saved myself by ducking
5926980 we were carrying supplies for them and they beat us up
5926981 even now if they call it an economic blockade and fuel the fire in kashmir on a non issue this is the most unfortunate thing to happen
5926982 the world has been seeing and reporting the economic blockade enforced by the extremist forces in jammu against the valley people it was their frustrations and they cannot deny what is the writing on the wall
5926983 intimidating a witness before a pending trial is very serious and the system can not work effectively without having our witnesses freely and voluntarily come forward to testify

5926987 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
5926988 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5926989 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5926990 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5926991 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5926992 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5926993 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5926994 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5926995 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5926996 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5926997 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5926998 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5926999 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5927000 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5927001 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
5927002 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school
5927003 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5927004 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5927005 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5927006 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5927007 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5927008 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
5927009 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5927010 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5927011 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5927012 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5927013 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5927014 magicians have developed powerful cognitive principles and intuitions about attention and awareness that are not understood scientifically
5927015 weve been able to learn more about cognition from magicians who have developed illusions that trick audiences
5927016 the collaboration on this project has led to many exciting insights to help us understand the brains underlying cognition
5927017 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
5927018 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
5927019 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
5927020 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases
5927021 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural especially for women
5927022 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5927023 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
5927024 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion
5927025 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
5927026 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly
5927027 so far a lot of experiments have been carried out with optical techniques that are sometimes difficult to integrate in a complete system the new nanostructures we envisage will make it possible for us to miniaturize systems even further and to develop commercially feasible equipment
5927028 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5927029 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5927030 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5927031 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined
5927032 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
5927033 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5927034 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5927035 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5927036 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5927037 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5927038 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines

5927041 if the chicago cubs come into town would they be allowed to buy the milwaukee brewers out and shut them down because they dont want to compete against them thats what were up against they come right up and tell us we put too much paper out make it too fast doing too good of a job so were shutting you down to me its just wrong
5927042 a lot of stress in his life and that he had been having thoughts about doing something like this for four or five years

5927045 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes
5927046 by knowing the mechanics of the reactions we can fine tune the catalysts for even better performance

5927048 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5927049 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5927050 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5927051 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
5927052 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
5927053 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
5927054 elder mistreatment in the u s prevalence estimates from a nationally representative study
5927055 is there anyone who insults you or puts you down
5927056 is there anyone who has taken your money or belongings without your ok or prevented you from getting them even when you ask
5927057 is there anyone who hits kicks slaps or throws things at you
5927058 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
5927059 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
5927060 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
5927061 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation
5927062 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination
5927063 the magnitude of the obesity epidemic adds a staggering burden to our current health care system these studies point to the serious potential risks of gi disease for individuals who are overweight or obese
5927064 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5927065 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5927066 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5927067 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5927068 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5927069 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
5927070 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5927071 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5927072 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5927073 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5927074 the identification of rheb as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of cancer opens new avenues for the development of anti cancer therapies as rheb is an inherently druggable target indeed we are already testing such drugs alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics in faithful animal models
5927075 the key clinical implication is that rheb levels in tumor tissue could indicate patients that will benefit from relatively non toxic therapies with targeted drugs like rapamyicn or inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme
5927076 brachytherapy may be the preferable treatment for obese men with early stage prostate cancer
5927077 being overweight does not present any unique technical challenges for brachytherapy as it does for surgery and external beam
5927078 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5927079 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5927080 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5927081 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5927082 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5927083 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5927084 results suggest that trainers under time constraints could increase their training effectiveness during the early stages of training by not feeding excess dietary energy
5927085 we dont want to give the impression that you should starve them in order to enhance their good behavior
5927086 horses being ridden by less experienced riders need to be calm and easy to handle characteristics that may be enhanced by more effective early training
5927087 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5927088 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5927089 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5927090 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
5927091 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
5927092 a company that is looking to move toward bio based materials may find it far more cost effective to encourage purchases of green power in its supply chain when they look at its total supply chain carbon footprint
5927093 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5927094 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5927095 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5927096 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5927097 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5927098 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic
5927099 the index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of atlantic hurricane activities
5927100 further studies are needed to discern the general prediction capability of our results
5927101 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5927102 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5927103 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5927104 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5927105 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5927106 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5927107 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5927108 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5927109 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5927110 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5927111 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5927112 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5927113 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5927114 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5927115 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5927116 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5927117 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together

5927120 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies

5927122 more web sites are adopting recaptchas each day so the rate of transcription keeps growing
5927123 more than 4 million words are being transcribed every day it would take more than 1 500 people working 40 hours a week at a rate of 60 words a minute to match our weekly output
5927124 we are demonstrating that we can take human effort human processing power that would otherwise be wasted and redirect it to accomplish tasks that computers cannot yet solve
5927125 he sold the bag of wool he sold the shawl his wife made
5927126 no no no he didnt sell his computer or his vacuum cleaner
5927127 no he had a computer but he didnt sell it
5927128 no he didnt have a computer back then they didnt have computers
5927129 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5927130 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5927131 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5927132 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5927133 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5927134 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5927135 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5927136 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5927137 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5927138 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between bph luts and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation

5927140 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5927141 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5927142 it seems that because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality

5927150 there was also the report of some polling stations recording the presence of more than the expected number of political party agents needed to be present
5927151 registrants paid commercial operators ghc 2 00 for photographs and ghc 1 00 for lamination
5927152 while generally publicity about the exercise improved with time the messages communicated about the registration procedures tended to be unclear and in some cases confusing to the public hence some people going to registration centres with the aim of voting or replacing missing voter cards or transfer of votes
5927153 it is estimated that 500 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year 75 per cent of whom are above 50 years
5927154 musicians are role models and since our fans are all not from the same political party it is prudent not to show ones party affiliation at this time in our country where we are still nursing our democracy
5927155 musicians as members of the public have a right to belong to a political party and vote during election time but unlike the us where their democracy is 200 years old ghana is only 18 years and it would be unwise to liken ourselves to them absolutely
5927156 we need to stick to our unifying role as musicians in the interest of public peace
5927157 as musicians its easier for us to make peace since we speak the language of the soul as peace makers if we publicly take sides how can we really be taken as peace makers

5927178 and if you do fast know that it is better for you if only you knew
5927179 just as it has been prescribed for those people before you so that perhaps you may have taqwa
5927180 oh allah grant us barakah in rajab and shaban and grant us the ability to reach ramadan
5927181 if a person were to fast forever they wouldnt be able to make up for the barakah of ramadan
5927182 time is like a sword that cuts if you dont cut it it cuts you

5927190 we wanted to be part of the change taking place in ghana issues that were peculiar to women were not being tackled so we established the movement with the four un principles of developing women politically economically culturally and socially as the yardstick
5927191 we are tired of selfish governments we need a selfless government that cares and runs the country with a human face
5927192 social protection for all a prerequisite for consolidating democratic governance the role of the trades unions
5927193 the country is being run by foreigners its becoming increasingly difficult for ghanaians to run business in their own country but developed and advanced countries were built by the indigenous people
5927194 foreigners come here and assume control of the economic sector from banking through to petty trading and are now infiltrating into the political terrain this is dangerous for the development of the country
5927195 anytime you express your candid opinion depending on what you say you are either tagged as new patriotic party npp or national democratic congress ndc activist
5927196 this is dissuading meaningful non political persons to genuinely contribute to national debate and offer alternative ideas
5927197 if just the registration of electorate degenerates into violence breach of the political parties election 2008 code of conduct and other infractions then god save ghana we cannot anticipate what will happen on election day
5927198 the christian community is not happy about this mayhem intimidation antagonism and political animosity among the political parties we are advising our members to shun from politicians who engage in personality attacks and other undemocratic tendencies ghanaians need peace and stability to develop
5927199 we detest politicians who attack personalities but appreciate those who propagate on issues personality attacks distract voters but issue based politicking attracts floating voters

5927202 the ec should do everything it can to purge the register of the names of the dead and cases of underage alien and multiple registration
5927203 it was evident also that the ec itself had grossly underestimated the scale and enormity of the task of the voter registration exercise 2008 the two month delay in the registration exercise had brought into play many locality specific and age specific variables that could not have been anticipated
5927204 if we are able to incorporate ourselves well set our own zoning standards

5927227 laskar pelangi salah cetak hingga warnanya jadi ngeluntur kayak gini
5927228 an error in judgment involving the approval of excessive transfer credits and excessive units for independent study in lieu of course work
5927229 we always take any issue regarding academic integrity very seriously
5927230 this is something where when we find out something like this we review it immediately
5927231 you just dont know pride unless you are a texan
5927232 pittsburgh has to be one of the worst cycling cities in america
5927233 it was like living with jihad on a daily basis
5927234 converting from islam to any other religion is illegal in yemen and can be punishable by death
5927235 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5927236 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5927237 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5927238 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5927239 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5927240 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5927241 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5927242 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5927243 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5927244 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5927245 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5927246 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5927247 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5927248 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need
5927249 our polling today shows mccain well outside the margin of error in both of those counties
5927250 but they will be battlegrounds i give senator obama credit for coming in trying to fight it out there for every vote
5927251 i think this is not the forum to really get into that
5927252 john mccain is a republican i can not predict exactly how he will work with the other office seekers of our side but i think he will be a working partner
5927253 at this time the polling is clearly for mark warner but i have seen a lot of strange things in politics in my 48 years in politics we are not conceding anything
5927254 well mark warner qualifies mark has a very centrist image up here in northern virginia mark has some unique attributes living up here that make him particularly more formidable than the average democrat in northern virginia
5927255 these middle aged republican white men are in for a surprise when the votes are counted on election day their private polls grossly undercount newly registered black and young voters and are based on voter registration lists that are outdated and inaccurate
5927256 the dems are gonna take their guns and let homos get married
5927257 the 4 steps to asking for exactly what you want and nothing less
5927258 focusing on problems to make them go away is not how the universe works focusing on the solutions or more accurately the feeling associated with the outcome of a solution is what allows us to attract whatever solution is best for any given situation
5927259 until you actually do this you will never know how powerful it is the longer and more detailed you make your list the more likely you are to get into the exact vibrational state you want in order to attract what you are writing about
5927260 if you can generate the same emotions you will have when your desire is fulfilled you align vibrationally with the reality of the desire fulfilled and thus become a magnet to it
5927261 this requires some degree of visualization as you visualize or imagine you want to conjure up a reaction from every one of your five senses you want to see hear feel smell and taste your desire being fulfilled and the key is to stay in that state as long as possible
5927262 letting go does not mean to stop wanting what you want
5927263 loose my email address loose my phone number loose my address i never want to have anything to do with you again
5927264 yes your heiness is there anything else i can do for you
5927265 lifeway research has just concluded a significant longitudinal study of 2 500 protestant churchgoers which tracks their growth and beliefs over time
5927266 when comparing the results of our study from the survey in may 2007 to the one recently completed in may of this year we found great instability in the beliefs and practices of churchgoers
5927267 in may of 2007 we found 52 percent of our sample identified themselves as born again and 23 percent as evangelical
5927268 how beautifully leaves grow old how full of light and color are their last days

5927279 welcome my son weve been waiting for you now go inside and raise a cup or two and meet with your brother
5927280 great goddess mother of us all thank you for joining us tonight stay if you will go if you must know in our hearts you blessed be
5927281 well yes he is known as that to some he is also known to some as a god himself that was
5927282 think about it logically my son the lucifer that you know is a fallen angel cast out of heaven for challenging me if i am the all powerful being above all others how could he do this how could i allow it
5927283 the bible is a wonderful book as are the koran and the torah and many others but they are just books written by the hand of man not written by me and its a bit confusing as well if the truth be known but thats not up to me to fix these books are wonderful but only as guidance for each man and woman must think for themselves
5927284 now come forth we must journey a little more before you go back
5927285 my son you prayed tonight for a true vision of me for vision you must only open your eyes and see what there is to see good night to you

5927294 love is when someone calls you and you get butterflies in your stomach when their name comes up on the caller id love is when you are willing to change your life just to be with that person love is this feeling of unconditional passion want and need for someone love is being in their presence and feeling like youre the only two people in the world and feeling like nothing bad could ever happen because you were in their arms
5927295 it looks like the giants have picked up right where they left off
5927296 im going to be in ministry full time ill focus a lot of my time an energy on growing closer to god and knowing him more this will happen automatically

5927299 i was going to do one at a time starting with the small one on each foot and working my way in but this big sucker has been calling my name
5927300 it is not that i cannot create anything good but that i will not
5927301 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
5927302 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
5927303 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5927304 well okay so im not loving it but sometimes pilots are a little slow to get off the ground im sure by the next ep or two it will find its footing

5927307 quando as falanges maced nicas e as legi es romanas lhe mostraram a vida sombria grave e sem sorrisos como a que haviam conhecido ent o sua sabedoria transformou se em excentricidade
5927308 a wretch like me is a band based on a passion for heavy music a genuine love for all sorts of people and a glorious devotion to the lord jesus christ notice its not a devotion to a religion but to the savior
5927309 as we grow up we learn that even the one person that wasnt supposed to ever let us down probably will youll have your heart broken and youll break others hearts youll fight with your best friend or maybe even fall in love with them and youll cry because time is flying by so take too many pictures laugh too much forgive freely and love like youve never been hurt life comes with no guarantees no time outs no second chances you just have to live life to the fullest tell someone what they mean to you and tell someone off speak out dance in the pouring rain hold someones hand comfort a friend fall asleep watching the sun come up stay up late be a flirt and smile until your face hurts dont be afraid to take chances or fall in love and most of all live in the moment because every second you spend angry or upset is a second of happiness you can never get back

5927376 you shall worship the lord your god and him only you shall serve
5927377 therefore since we are the off spring of god we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone something shaped by art and mans devising
5927378 that the name of god and his doctrine may not be blasphemed
5927379 for he has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way
5927380 you shall not make for yourself a carved image any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me but showing mercy to thousands to those who love me and keep my commandments
5927381 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
5927382 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord your god in it you shall do no work you nor your son nor your daughter nor your male servant nor your female servant nor your cattle nor your stranger who is within your gates for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
5927383 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long upon the land which the lord your god is giving you
5927384 rachel i spray the oven with oven cleaner all you do is wipe it down you understand wipe it down with soapy water you good i show you no ok then i go now
5927385 we have not obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets
5927386 yes all israel as transgressed your law and has departed so as not to obey your voice therefore the curse and the oath written in the law of moses the servant of god have been poured out on us because we have sinned against him
5927387 where there is no law there is not transgression or sin
5927388 most people would agree that buildings represent a valuable record of any societys past but controversy arises when old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes in such situations modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings so that contemporary needs can be served
5927389 the study of history places too much emphasis on individuals the most significant events and trends in history were made possible not by the famous few but by groups of people whose identities have long been forgotten
5927390 history teaches us only one thing knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today
5927391 the study of history has value only to the extent that it is relevant to our daily lives
5927392 the chief benefit of the study of history is to break down the illusion that people in one period of time are significantly different from people who lived at any other time in history
5927393 most people would agree that buildings represent a valuable record of any societys past but controversy arises when old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes in such situations modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings so that contemporary needs can be served
5927394 when historic buildings come across modern purposes what should we do
5927395 the study of history places too much emphasis on individuals the most significant events and trends in history were made possible not by the famous few but by groups of people whose identities have long been forgotten
5927396 chrissy no one is good enough for me in your eyes
5927397 i always told myself that the first girl you get along with will be the one lol
5927398 when youre going thru just call on jesus jesus jesus
5927399 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
5927400 theres always more work to do but we are well past what our contract calls for once we got a candidate the whole world changed

5927409 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
5927410 by the way my vp also will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these 4th branches of government where he thinks hes above the law

5927412 the fire is currently limited to the shura councils second floor we are still trying to determine the exact cause of the fire
5927413 parliament is currently on summer recess and very few people would have been in the building
5927414 when you are attacked normally you will fight back that was what happened in mamasapano
5927415 we have internal investigation and we will penalize them if found guilty
5927416 the reward system is unilateral on the part of the government
5927417 we will defend our field commanders if force is used against them by the government we have mechanism about it and it would be good for all if the mechanism is followed
5927418 they are human beings i know its difficult to say this to the poor soul involved in this but when you have a human element involved in anything you have the possibility of an error
5927419 seven days a week she was always there as long as ive known her
5927420 i dont know hopefully they can figure out something so it can be more direct when someone gives an address
5927421 we use the word bias in certain areas of our study but we also talk about blind spots
5927422 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
5927423 we were surprised that this was a recurrence of something we saw in the late 1990s this is something we have to revisit periodically
5927424 and we want to share it with other states and ems systems because if its happening in maryland its likely happening everywhere
5927425 trauma is often seen as a disease of the young
5927426 but thats changing you have a fairly active aging population that is playing sports being active and getting injured
5927427 no one ever admits they have a bias they say they know someone who does something biased
5927428 basically its difficult to get a handle on what bias is so instead of defining bias we wanted to show that people behaved differently and find a way to fix the problem
5927429 sometimes the younger doctors see a person being evaluated and it turns out to be negative and the patient is sent home
5927430 part of the problem is everybodys got aches and pains its hard to tell is that a broken hip or something else
5927431 this is much more complicated in older people there are many issues that make injury in the elderly much more difficult to get your arms around
5927432 and we want the mothers who have children that are near these men to know about their history
5927433 rounded up into torture camps the undesirables china doesnt want you to see
5927434 this bill is really our best bet to deter unscrupulous traders from manipulating energy prices and engaging in excessive speculation this has been a long hard road and this is a major legislative victory
5927435 wer sich einb rgert wird mehr an der gesellschaft beteiligt
5927436 es kann nicht sein dass die arbeit eines angestellten weniger wert ist als die arbeit eines beamten
5927437 sowohl angestellte als auch beamte m ssen ins rentensystem einzahlen
5927438 alle elemente der rentenreform m ssen wirkungsgleich auf die beamten bertragen werden
5927439 i told him im going to stay away from him a little bit because everybody is telling him too much right now
5927440 then your mind gets clouded and he makes mistakes he normally wouldnt make you dont want to tell him too much so i told him im going to step back a little bit and have everybody else leave him alone and let him go out and play football
5927441 to have a feeling like that that you havent had in a while gives you a little confidence
5927442 he made the one guy miss and he ran over the safety theres going to be one of those guys you have to take care of yourself and hes starting to understand that and get yards
5927443 its nice to not have to throw him into the fire he can go bits and pieces until we have to use him
5927444 i have no problems using him in any phase right now whether its first and 10 short yardage goal line or third down but were still two weeks away hell find his actual role
5927445 for a bigger guy you wouldnt expect that from him hes able to get in and out of holes and make cuts that some people may not see
5927446 but maybe hes a little tentative just because things are moving so fast when youre trying to learn things when its new to you you kind of hesitate a little trying to make everything right
5927447 its been what you expected but getting through it is a different story
5927448 you hear about how difficult it is but its different when you play out there its getting accustomed to everything and gaining experience
5927449 because of moving the headquarters we wanted to alleviate some of the cost to people
5927450 we have a telework program for our employees and we are using it more today than we have in the past
5927451 gas prices have definitely resulted in more interest in the program recently
5927452 we find when people have an ability to decide when where and how they do their work they are much more connected to the organization and that certainly makes them more productive
5927453 federated has a strong and flexible balance sheet that positions the company to continue to pursue growth opportunities including acquisitions
5927454 i always felt i would be back before the timetable anyway
5927455 i always have whenever i had anything done before but you want to err on the side of caution
5927456 not the first day out there to start sprinting and put it out there like its game day
5927457 i want to play but i want to play against houston

5927472 lunch should not be skipped for both employee health and productivity
5927473 workers are worried about what people will say if they take too long on their break
5927474 the biggest thing employers can do for productivity is encourage lunch workers tend to have a lot more energy if they take a break meaning theyre more on the ball for the afternoon stretch
5927475 you will find youre getting more work done than if you didnt break at all
5927476 workers tend to go home feeling energised and are less likely to lounge around and snack if theyve had a boost in the middle of the day
5927477 employees need to make more proactive choices when it comes to lunch and taking breaks in the office
5927478 employers need to lead by example and get out of the office at lunch
5927479 this is part of our history now its part of our future

5927521 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights

5927526 if all the information and knowledge scattered all over the world on the web could be organized in an orderly way so that anybody could access it whenever they needed to then the world would undergo a major change
5927527 it is scenery viewable from public roads and therefore it must be public
5927528 people walking along public roads must avert their glance from the living spaces right before their eyes
5927529 we dont really know but google must anyway be an absolute positive
5927530 arranging the worlds information in order to make it possible for people across the world to access it
5927531 even just filming the scenery from the street with camera in hand theres no question that if you tried to shoot the area not covered by street view you would be asked after initial questioning to come to either the ikegami police station or the den en chofu police station
5927532 japan is a unique culture unlike any other on earth
5927533 hey its our custom were doing no harm leave us alone if you dont share our beliefs
5927534 if its not explicitly forbidden to do its a ok
5927535 there is no japanese way there is also no american way btw
5927536 global voices has a translation of an excellent open letter to google by osamu higuchi explaining that street view is too invasive for japanese traditional values when used in
5927537 wow i wonder if his comments represent a general japanese sentiment about streetview
5927538 wow i bet a lot of people dont like it
5927539 if all the information and knowledge scattered all over the world on the web could be organized in an orderly way so that anybody could access it whenever they needed to then the world would undergo a major change
5927540 there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening
5927541 while there are many constants across the globe and being uncomfortable about streetview may well be one of them i would also add that people can arrive to the same conclusion through different paths in this case object to streetview for different reasons
5927542 i just wanted to say that japanese life space is in a different scale especially when compared with american
5927543 from a passport page hogging stigma signifying our country deems people from your country deeply suspect and liable to violate immigration laws the visa will evolve into a badge of well travelledness and sophistication
5927544 it would be impossible to understand haiti without knowing its music art and dance

5927560 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness

5927562 laboratory work in mice flies and worms shows that if igf1 is removed the animals tend not to get cancer
5927563 this is now mirrored in research into small humans who turn out to have no igf1 as in laron dwarfs
5927564 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5927565 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5927566 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5927567 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5927568 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5927569 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5927570 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5927571 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5927572 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5927573 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

5927591 these are strange times indeed while they continue to command so much attention in the mainstream media the battles between old and new modes of distribution between the pirate and the institution of copyright seem to many of us already lost and won we know who the victors are why then say any more because waves of repression continue to come lawsuits are still levied against innocent people arrests are still made on flimsy pretexts in order to terrify and confuse harsh laws are still enacted against filesharing taking their place in the gradual erosion of our privacy and the bolstering of the surveillance state all of this is intended to destroy or delay inexorable changes in what it means to create and exchange our creations if steal this film ii proves at all useful in bringing new people into the leagues of those now prepared to think after intellectual property think creatively about the future of distribution production and creativity we have achieved our main goal

5927613 weve kept up our patrols but we havent found any kids in or around them
5927614 weve reinterviewed staff in the area and theyre now saying they believe the kids were playing in the bins and not actually residing in them
5927615 were following a number of leads to try to identify the family these kids belong to just to make sure there are no issues and so that we can confirm the kids were just playing
5927616 but certainly a closer examination of the bedding would suggest it is not children that are actually using this bin to sleep in if that is in fact what it is being used for

5927641 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5927642 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5927643 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5927644 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5927645 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run

5927685 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
5927686 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5927687 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5927688 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5927689 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programmes will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5927690 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5927691 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5927692 our assumption yesterday was hopefully the mother was around and it would find the mother and go from there
5927693 if we dont see the animal again then wed like to assume the best but well still keep a vigil and ask the public if theyre perhaps on the other side of frederick henry bay to keep looking for the animal
5927694 but theres nothing to say the animal hasnt moved out to somewhere down south like nubeena or bruny island but well obviously check the most obvious places first and then move in a radius after that
5927695 i think weve all been joyously watching the olympics to win at cycling sailing and now on the track and yet another set of great gold medals
5927696 it is a huge tribute to the olympic team i look forward to congratulating them in person
5927697 it bodes so well for 2012 and i think the whole nation is totally delighted and really proud at everything thats been achieved
5927698 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
5927699 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
5927700 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5927701 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5927702 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5927703 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5927704 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5927705 the growth in services exports is being driven by international education
5927706 around 40 of malaysian students in australia choose victoria with more than 7600 enrolments in 2007
5927707 given the strong alumni links and growing trade and investment relationships between victoria and south east asia travel for business and pleasure will continue to expand
5927708 needle stick injuries are very common in both the medical and veterinary areas but my advice is that the risk of this person becoming infected is extremely low
5927709 thats not really what i think it is is it
5927710 kukaan ei suostu ottamaan vastaan toisesta maasta ydinj tett jos alkaisimme tuottaa ydins hk juuri vienti varten horjuttaisimme perustelujamme joilla torjumme jyrk sti mahdollisuuden tuoda ulkoa ydinj tett varastoitavaksi suomeen
5927711 oh my god yall i think i just hit that hobo
5927712 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5927713 his conduct can no longer be tolerated the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5927714 this is just adding to the already brewing controversy and frustration in the heart of the athletes and including the viewers
5927715 that was obvious these two young ladies were the very best uneven bar performance in the world congratulations for them theyve done nothing wrong but theyve certainly deserved at the time when finally the judging opinion is presiding in the same place sure you got to give them what they deserve to have
5927716 both of you have proven without a doubt that your abilities are far beyond that of your peers through your mutual success you now find yourself here
5927717 along with a gold medal surely valuable enough to barter for a lifetime supply of pacifiers and cabbage patch dolls
5927718 we have over 4 500 sq ft of gallery space but we could barely get into the building when the submissions came in
5927719 we were absolutely overwhelmed with the response and our judging panel had some really tough choices to make when selecting the 71 works which make up the exhibition
5927720 what is particularly exciting is that the award has attracted artists of all ages and backgrounds they range from art college graduates to royal academicians
5927721 the selectors have now chosen which shortlisted piece will receive the 10 000 federation of british artists selectors choice however as this wont be announced until 3 september its going to be fascinating to see if the selectors choice reflects that of the voting public
5927722 this device cannot find enough free resources that it can use
5927723 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5927724 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5927725 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5927726 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5927727 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5927728 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5927729 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5927730 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5927731 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5927732 i am shocked and dismayed at the types severity and volume of crime and intolerance found online this information is too valuable to sit on we have to go state wide with this get every clergy council involved become united teach our communities these things
5927733 a crime against one religion is a crime against all religions
5927734 i am really pleased with the outcome the enthusiastic response to the lessons provided by these experts the interfaith community came together in harmony and learned something that we can apply immediately to improve this vital problem
5927735 i have noticed that a calm has come to me i have been less reactive i rarely use foul language which before would roll off my tongue if one slips i am more aware of it now before i would not even stop myself when i was aware of it
5927736 what i learned is that a marriage must be created not just once but every day every second you are around each other that communication and trust is the principal tools to use in creating this lasting partnership the main success i got from this was applying it to my own marriage
5927737 it has reinstated such important principles as how to handle and raise a child to help him or her achieve full potential i now give my students more freedom allow each of them to grow as their own individual person and not so much just a stationary kid who only does and knows what society expects him or her to do
5927738 i was able to successfully resolve two conflicts one in my hood and the other at a party
5927739 i was glad to put what i have learnt into practice and it did work out perfectly
5927740 i found that my children are best responsive when given an option in life and that through support and help and listening to what they have to say it has made them happier i have found this to be a fantastic way of seeing my children almost always happy they have gone through a traumatic experience this has been the most relevant thing i have done with my children and i have learned that by letting them choose it opens up a new happiness for us all i personally still struggle that they are not with me all of the time but the times they are with me they are a pleasure to be with
5927741 i am more capable of establishing bonds with other people and overcoming past hurts
5927742 in the past i only had a superficial relationship with my sister
5927743 i have been able to reach out to her and to reestablish close bonds with her and her family
5927744 i really learned to be a better person with this course
5927745 using the lessons to better my study and retention skills
5927746 i am happier now than i have been in many years thanks to learning what i have learned here
5927747 i am looking forward to meeting with employees today and growers during the two week roadshow starting on monday to outline the particular perspective i will bring as chairman being initially from outside the kiwifruit industry
5927748 it could be an absolutely gorgeous building by the time theyre done with it and they do everything first rate
5927749 i want to say a big big thanks for all i have learned today most especially a need for total transformation of behavioral attitude and manner of approach most especially about human rights indeed i personally firstly must go out and tell my community nation and even internationally about human rights abuses and also the need to know the 30 rights in the universal declaration and how one must respect others and live with others peacefully
5927750 what i really learned and love from this program is everyone is equal
5927751 i thank the staff of yhri for the opportunity to participate in this unique workshop what i learned today will be with me forever i learned more about what it takes to be a leader a leader should be one who is innovative creative and communicative and who relates well with the people he she leads and a leader should know how to solve the plight of the people he she is leading
5927752 we are thrilled with this decision it will allow us to disseminate our beliefs and the works of our founder l ron hubbard much more broadly
5927753 our members are busy preparing to move to much larger quarters where we will be able to fill the increasing demand for our community services and work with local officials to help our country flourish and prosper
5927754 the new drug free mentors program will build and strengthen drug free activities in an age group that is very much at risk
5927755 the prevalence of drugs today makes it essential that we demonstrate even more widely that being drug free has a high value on both a personal and community level
5927756 programs like the marshals generate pride and respect and help ensure our communities are safe and healthy
5927757 we are ecstatic this is a memorable and historic day for us as it provides us with an even better opportunity to serve our community and scientologists
5927758 i think it is highly appropriate that i thank the church of scientology for exposing the most horrendous practices of the apartheid system of mental treatment of people
5927759 this is the first reported case of human fatality associated with zinc intoxication following a massive ingestion of coins four hundred and sixtyone coins were removed from the gastrointestinal tract of a schizophrenic patient during the course of hospitalization many of the post 1981 pennies which consist primarily of zinc showed severe corrosion due to their prolonged contact with acidic gastric juice the patient presented with clinical manifestations consistent with the local corrosive as well as systemic effects of zinc intoxication and died 40 days after admission with multi system organ failure
5927760 we were hoping to finish up by this coming october
5927761 were really battling with a lot of these issues and theyre really difficult
5927762 what we tried to do with the moratorium is take a step back really do some more planning and bring the community together around a plan that we can all feel good about
5927763 there are some opportunities that only come up sporadically and opportunistically to either buy a property at a certain price or to put funding together and those opportunities will be gone
5927764 do not allow yourself to become the next victim be competent when lives depend on you
5927765 if one is going to find fault with something it implies that he wishes to do something about it and would if he could if one does not like the crime cruelty injustice and violence of this society he can do something about it he can become a volunteer minister and help civilize it bring it conscience and kindness and love and freedom from travail by instilling into it trust decency honesty and tolerance
5927766 its surprisingly easy to get dexamphetamines a substance that is primarily used for treatment of add adhd by pretending you have add especially if someone who has been through the interview process coaches you with the right things to say
5927767 neither animals nor humans can tell the difference between cocaine amphetamine or methylphenidate ritalin when they are administered the same way at comparable doses in short they produce effects that are nearly identical
5927768 drugs set you up to get into situations which are truly disastrous and keep you that way
5927769 one of the worlds most influential authors whose many works of fiction and non fiction have both entertained and enlightened readers on all continents and contributed to our emerging global culture he is not only a publishing phenomenon his works are a treasure to be shared by all who believe that humanity can find solutions to its many problems and build a better world for all
5927770 the discoveries and developments which made the formulation of dianetics possible occupied many years of exact research and careful testing this was exploration it was also consolidation the trail is blazed the routes are sufficiently mapped for you to voyage in safety into your own mind and recover there your full inherent potential which is not we now know low but very very high
5927771 volunteers have arrived in peru from as far away as mexico city and los angeles
5927772 one volunteer from mexico city was thrilled that not only was his visa and that of one of his colleagues rushed through but he also received an official letter giving them access to the disaster zone
5927773 but i know that this volunteer ministers disaster relief program has been effective for many years in helping other areas struck by disasters and i know i can make a difference thats why i decided to go
5927774 drugs directly undermine the quality of life of every citizen and the safety of our communities
5927775 to reduce crime people must know the dangers of drug use and abuse and then widespread demand reduction will occur
5927776 much of the information about drugs that youth and adults alike are exposed to is based on rumor and hype that totally misses the real story
5927777 our materials fill a void providing straightforward information based on published reports and studies when people have the facts they can make intelligent decisions about drugs and they wont be fooled
5927778 ignorance breeds mistakes and bad choices and the lack of readily available easy to understand facts about drugs is destroying our quality of life
5927779 support of the work of law enforcement in circumventing drug trafficking and violence means every individual getting smart about drugs knowledge is power and it will bring about demand reduction
5927780 this recognition marks the end of an era in which spanish scientologists were forced to fight for their rights to religious freedom it vindicates the church of scientology and is a new beginning for all spanish scientologists
5927781 this is the culmination of a series of landmark victories for the church of scientology in europe thanks to this recognition we are now able to devote all our effort and attention to making our community and our country the best it can be for all its people the national courts decision is extremely significant because it constitutes the latest official recognition of the church of scientology as a religious organization in europe it mandates that scientologists and their religious associations be afforded the same rights and privileges as members of other registered religious organizations throughout the european community and in the european union
5927782 many parents today dont realize that when they send their children off on holidays they may be putting them at risk
5927783 exposure to drugs and alcohol typically increases at holiday locations young people need factual information so they can make informed decisions about drugs
5927784 we are overwhelmed with the support that we have received from these artists
5927785 i have always been involved in educating the children of india but when i was introduced to the study technology of l ron hubbard the founder of the scientology religion i then had tools that help kids to better retain their education tools that assist children who are slow tools educators can use to teach students how to learn this technology provides an understanding of the basics of learning and supplies exact ways to overcome the pitfalls one can encounter during study mr hubbard expressed something i believe in when he wrote the end and goal of any society as it addresses the problem of education is to raise the ability the initiative and the cultural level and with all of that the survival level of that society this is my dream for my homeland india
5927786 a being is only as valuable as he can serve others
5927787 drugs set you up to get into situations which are truly disastrous and keep you that way
5927788 from the time i discovered that a human being is not his body and demonstrated that through scientology auditing an individual can attain certainty of his identity apart from that of the body i have been with some reluctance out beyond any realm of the scientific known
5927789 scientology is the subject of knowing how to know it has taught us that a man is his own immortal soul and it gives us little choice but to announce to a world no matter how it receives it that nuclear physics and religion have joined hands and that we in scientology perform those miracles for which man through his entire search has hoped
5927790 that all men of whatever race color or creed were created with equal rights
5927791 i have come to know about the activities of scientology volunteer ministers led by the mr marc arrighi and mrs prisca arrighi from paris france in cuddalore villupuram and pondicherry they started their services immediately after the tsunami and worked with tsunami affected coastal communities including adults and school children ngo non governmental organization representatives and grass roots workers the target group was not only confined to communities primarily affected by the tsunami but also with the secondary affected groups study technology learning how to learn and dianetics has been highly useful for the people in the 77 villages in cuddalore district where they have been working i wish them good luck in all their future efforts and look forward to their partnership in the school education programme total literacy campaign and elimination of residual illiteracy
5927792 we broke up and i was trying to get her out of my heart dianetics helped me relieve all that tension all that pain and all that hurt
5927793 i was upset worried some people would call it depression that changed after dianetics counseling i became a much happier person i could really go after what i wanted in life
5927794 i can go outside and if its a great day i can feel it i mean i can really feel it the way i felt it when i was a kid i can enjoy the sunshine the way i could thirty years ago
5927795 dianetics is an adventure it is an exploration into terra incognita the human mind that vast and hitherto unknown realm half an inch back of our foreheads some of the things you will find may astonish you
5927796 anyone needing to reach us should stop by our yellow tent they can also contact us through the
5927797 thats why in addition to the one on one counseling we are providing we are also training other volunteers so they can help as well weve put out a call for any volunteer minister who can possibly arrange it to come join us
5927798 if you need to talk to someone call or email me at 1 800 help 4 yu 1 800 435 7498 or vm volunteerministers
5927799 man is now faced by these pyramiding hatreds with weapons so powerful that man himself may vanish from the earth there is no problem in the control of these weapons they explode when and where man tells them to explode the problem is in the control of man
5927800 there are no international concerns which cannot be resolved by peaceable means not in terms of supranational government but in terms of reason
5927801 mans primary fight is not with man that is insanity mans primary fight is with those elements which oppress him as a species and bar his thrust towards high goals mans fight is with the elements with space and time and with species which are destructive to him he has hardly begun his conquest
5927802 there is a higher goal a better goal a more glorious victory than gutted towns and radiation burned dead there is freedom and happiness and plenty and a whole universe to be won
5927803 how much can man conquer he loses if he conquers man he wins if he conquers his own fears and conquers then the stars
5927804 a being is only as valuable as he can serve others
5927805 the acquisition of the city national bank building fulfills our dream to find a fitting home for our rapidly growing scientology congregation in kansas city
5927806 the drug of choice in this part of the country
5927807 scientologists in our city are very active in drug education
5927808 scientology churches are actually considered pioneers and leaders in the restoration of vintage properties
5927809 we know that we can keep the historic beauty of this building and add to the vibrant environment that is being created in the area
5927810 downtown is alive and vibrant we want to be able to contribute to the cultural and spiritual growth of the area we want to add to the stability and future of kansas city and what better place to do that than right in the heart of the city
5927811 the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself universes and other life
5927812 the only tests of a life well lived are did he do what he intended and were people glad he lived
5927813 the planet has hit a barrier which prevents any widespread social progress drugs and other biochemical substances these can put people into a condition which not only prohibits and destroys physical health but which can prevent any stable advancement in mental or spiritual well being
5927814 i know your commitment to helping others is not limited to your own members and i know the way you extend that help is by building the base from which you operate the organization which is home to every scientologist here in buffalo not only in the physical sense but in your numbers and your ability more importantly your ability to deliver
5927815 making the bay area a better place for persons of all races colors creeds and walks of life
5927816 referred to its settled case law to the effect that as enshrined in article 9 freedom of thought conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a democratic society within the meaning of the convention it is in its religious dimension one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life but it is also a precious asset for atheists agnostics skeptics and the unconcerned the pluralism indissociable from a democratic society which has been dearly won over the centuries depends on it
5927817 in the light of the general principles outlined above the ability to establish a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of freedom of association without which that right would be deprived of any meaning the court has expressed the view that a refusal by the domestic authorities to grant legal entity status to an association of individuals may amount to an interference with the applicants exercise of their right to freedom of association where the organisation of the religious community is at issue a refusal to recognise it also constitutes interference with the applicants right to freedom of religion under article 9 of the convention the believers right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully free from arbitrary state intervention
5927818 the reasons invoked by the moscow justice department and endorsed by the moscow courts to deny re registration of the applicant branch had no legal basis it can be inferred that in denying registration to the church of scientology of moscow the moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis vis the applicants religious community in the light of the foregoing the court considers that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of religion and association was not justified there has therefore been a violation of article 11 of the convention read in the light of article 9
5927819 this decision not only confirms the rights of churches of scientology but also sets another important precedent to protect the rights of all other religious communities in europe
5927820 you value what i as a scientologist also hold dear having a strong loving family being honest and maintaining ones integrity
5927821 using our talents and abilities to make the society around us a better one
5927822 a volunteer minister does not shut his eyes to the pain evil and injustice of existence rather he is trained to handle these things and help others achieve relief from them and new personal strength as well

5927826 to help clean up and keep clean the field of mental health

5927828 we the undersigned pledge ourselves without reservation or any thought of personal comfort or safety to achieving the aims of scientology a civilization without insanity without war where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights
5927829 clean up and keep clean the field of mental health
5927830 the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself universes and other life
5927831 we saw houses with their roofs completely torn off a pole wrapped around an aeroplane steel structures taken down
5927832 electricity is off the hurricane ripped down the electrical cables some people have generators at work but few have them in their homes
5927833 find fraud waste and abuse in the commonwealths programs operations and contracts
5927834 whats the one thing i can do today to change my financial life
5927835 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5927836 the way nato assesses the fulfilment of this condition is biased they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side
5927837 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5927838 the resolution is a waste of time let me tell you its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
5927839 theres no signs as i mentioned that they are preparing for the withdrawal
5927840 in gori no one told us to leave or helped us to leave no one no car would stop now i see that we must take care of ourselves even here
5927841 i feel like my potential to succeed has been drastically reduced
5927842 we are thrilled at this honor its every musicians dream and for us the dream has come true
5927843 how proud we all feel in bringing the grammy home to share with the nation
5927844 this is a tremendous honor for the choir and all who worked so hard on the album and for south africa
5927845 through the years of turmoil and nelson mandelas long walk to freedom the music and art of south africa played a vital role in expressing the hope and aspirations of the people
5927846 soweto gospel choir members are representative of south africans everywhere and this award highlights what can be achieved
5927847 through their unique african gospel music the choir continues to bring joy to audiences around the world
5927848 scientology founder l ron hubbard said from southern africa will spring the next great civilization the spiritual energy in african music is so rich and diverse
5927849 there is something very special about its moods and rhythms i believe this music can inspire the spirit of brotherhood that can unite all people and bring about the civilization mr hubbard predicted
5927850 the choir will continue to spread the much needed messages of love joy and hope to audiences throughout the world regardless of their color language or faith
5927851 so much care goes into restoring our buildings we work hard to maintain their original character and charm while making them fully functional for the needs of our parishioners and staff

5927861 i thought i could just operate with my own interests in mind now i see i survive better if i help others survive too
5927862 people sometimes get hurt in the business of living the human body is subject to disease injuries and various mishaps of accidental or intentional character
5927863 throughout the ages religions have attempted to relieve mans physical suffering
5927864 today medicine treats the body when there is something wrong with it but it overlooks almost totally the relationship of the spiritual being to his body and the effect the former has on the latter
5927865 a volunteer minister does not shut his eyes to the pain evil and injustice of existence rather he is trained to handle these things and help others achieve relief from them and new personal strength as well
5927866 piddler on the roof because of the second floor location of the napier city council parking meter

5927874 even though the un adopted this declaration almost 60 years ago hardly anyone can tell you what these rights are people who dont know their rights and responsibilities will never demand them or uphold them
5927875 human rights must be made a fact not an idealistic dream
5927876 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert he said
5927877 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb insp jaramazovic said
5927878 we are certainly appealing for members of the public to come forward if they have information in relation to the person responsible insp jaramazovic said
5927879 it appears to be an isolated incident not linked to any other threat
5927880 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody ms lane said today in the perth magistrates court

5927887 our doors are open to you to everyone we want you to find out for yourself who we really are we want you to find out for yourself what we really do
5927888 in the very tradition of religions creating a climate for peace on earth
5927889 we moved into the twenty first century by building churches like this one on four continents each is situated on the cultural crossroads so that anyone may find what we are and what we represent
5927890 as for why it is inherent in every new church of scientology to be an active and responsible participant and member of the community in which they live we also recognize that the church of scientologys increased public awareness inevitably results in questions regarding our beliefs and practices and our new churches provide large exhibits open to the public so they can find answers to their questions
5927891 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
5927892 had the vegetation been adequately maintained the truck driver would have been able to clearly see the ghan stop and then proceed safely over the crossing when the train had passed
5927893 we did that reduced the staff for a reason she said in sydney today
5927894 we looked across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened that was one of the ways we delivered the budget surplus and we thought that was very important in fighting inflation
5927895 the government has got no present plans to make changes

5927898 being an idealist and i always have been pretty naive i trust everyone i just didnt know it was possible to be a victim of this sort of thing
5927899 it is also the consumers responsibility to treat every financial transaction with care to protect themselves and their hard earned money
5927900 this crime was planned and executed for political reasons the opportunity presented itself for clearing turkish soil of a christian race
5927901 who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the armenians
5927902 as on the gates of dantes hell the following should be written at the entrance of these accursed encampments you who enter leave all hopes
5927903 revenge the horrors of which have not yet been recorded in history
5927904 the armed gangs saw their main task as raiding and looting armenian villages if the men escaped their grasp they would rape the women
5927905 squads of 50 or 100 men would be taken bound together in groups of four and marched to a secluded spot
5927906 suddenly the sound of rifle shots would fill the air those sent to bury the bodies would find them almost invariably stark naked for as usual the turks had stolen all their clothes
5927907 a massacre however horrible the word may sound would be humane in comparison with it
5927908 save us we will become muslims we will become germans we will become anything you want just save us they are going to cut our throats
5927909 at every station where we stopped we came side by side with one of these trains it was made up of cattle trucks and the faces of little children were looking out from behind the tiny barred windows of each truck
5927910 each girl had been nailed alive upon her cross spikes through her feet and hands
5927911 only their hair blown by the wind covered their bodies
5927912 these things were done to secure the future of our homeland which we know is greater and holier than even our own lives
5927913 i was like a man standing by a river without any means of rescue
5927914 trying to survive in a chaotic dishonest and generally immoral society is difficult
5927915 one can feel at times like a spinning leaf blown along a dirty street one can feel like a grain of sand stuck in one place
5927916 one can feel that things are such now that it is much too late to do anything that ones past road is so messed up that there is no chance of drawing a future one that will be any different there is always a point on the road when one can map a new one and try to follow it there is no person alive who cannot make a new beginning
5927917 when i say subhaan allaah lillah wa laa ilaah ill allaah wa allaahu akbar glory be to allaah praise be to allaah there is no god except allaah and allaah is most great this is more beloved to me than all that the sun rises upon
5927918 tell us mr hubbard what is scientology how would you describe it
5927919 we live in a world where conflict crime and continual chaos dominate the news it is time for positive and sweeping change
5927920 working hand in hand with other churches community leaders government officials and a wide range of organizations we are making an important difference in society
5927921 no matter the problem something can be done about it
5927922 the purpose of the campaign is to educate people on their human rights these rights are the foundation on which freedom and peace can be built
5927923 more than 200 schools have adopted the campaign and are teaching human rights to children and teens young people are getting involved
5927924 we recognize that drugs both street drugs and psychotropic prescription drugs are the source of a multi billion dollar industry that is ruining an entire generation
5927925 our drug prevention programs keep young people from falling into this trap
5927926 these programs are there to combat every one of societys ills
5927927 drug abuse crime illiteracy immorality human rights violations these problems cannot be ignored and while the past year saw expansion greater than at any time in our history 2007 will be even better
5927928 we offer our help to anyone no matter their religion race or creed
5927929 we only ask that you use these effective solutions and make them available to others
5927930 not only because i am gay but because of what i look like i am not a barbie girl with barbie doll like looks because in television what you look like is a huge deal
5927931 rachel goes far beyond politics shes an expert on military affairs she was a rhodes scholar
5927932 isnt it hard to only have three minutes to argue against the death penalty
5927933 you have to learn to survive and prosper in a hostile environment
5927934 its kind of a talent that gay people bring to everything we do
5927935 all of the library books i have are tagged with rfid chips which is used for inventory control that should mean that i can use
5927936 no i still havent found my overdue books but at least now i know what they look like the aadl prints a helpful list of the books you have checked out but doesnt give you pictures of them not yet at least so im working on the greasemonkey script that will insert cover images into that page this is not that but a step along the way
5927937 the fashion industry and the advertising industry are steeped in racism you just have to look around at the number of black girls you see in ads virtually nil among the main fashion brands they are completely under represented its shocking and atrocious
5927938 i have tried to redress the balance it is enormously important to use black models and models of different ethnic backgrounds
5927939 we are using a lot of black models like iman not only the models of today a lot of different girls
5927940 because nobody is using black girls i see so many beautiful girls and they were complaining that they are not used enough
5927941 maybe in our country it is not the best idea but i dont care i think it is not my problem if they dont like it its their problem
5927942 there has been frustration over the years from a lot of ethnic models stylists and editors who have felt that they were not working as much as some of their caucasian counterparts
5927943 there has been a shift recently supportive media coverage has had an impact on the fashion industry
5927944 and what makes these tools special is how easy they are to learn and how effective they are
5927945 if i were to tell you that all you have to do to feel better is to communicate you might not believe me
5927946 affinity reality and communication form the arc triangle with each point dependent upon the other two these are the component parts of understanding
5927947 a principal application of arc is to increase affinity reality and communication and thus understanding between oneself and another how does one talk to somebody else
5927948 the way to do this is to establish reality by finding something with which you and the other person agree
5927949 then you attempt to maintain as high an affinity level as possible by knowing there is something you can like about him
5927950 all three corners of the arc triangle will have been established and you are then able to talk to him
5927951 now it can sometimes be a real challenge to find something you agree about and it can be rough maintaining a high level of affinity for someone who is having a go at you but the more skill one has in communication the better he or she can raise the other two corners of the triangle and when you try it out a few times and see how effective it is you will know its absolutely worth the effort
5927952 the soldier above all others prays for peace for he must suffer and bear the deepest scars of war
5927953 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
5927954 now cardinal newmans great friendship with ambrose st john is being slyly suggested as evidence of his being subject to a disordered sexuality
5927955 the mt sequoyah area does not have adequate storage for the water demand in the area and the city needs to address the situation
5927956 there is only one road into albay where all the effected villages are
5927957 there is no electricity in the area and this applies to a 200 km 124 mile radius some businesses have generators we are staying in a hostel that has a generator which they turn on at night
5927958 we arrived at 4pm and went to the headquarters for all government organizations that are providing relief then we met with the governor of the region we told him we would be helping those who had been evacuated he thanked us for being here and told us to coordinate with the social welfare office if we need anything
5927959 emily delivered an assist to a young girl who was extremely despondent and unresponsive after about 15 minutes she suddenly opened her eyes and knew what was going on around her
5927960 the inherent dignity equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family
5927961 as the european capital brussels has the potential of influencing the future for good or for ill

5927963 to educate young people in the universal declaration of human rights so they become valuable advocates for tolerance and peace
5927964 human rights must be made a fact not an idealistic dream

5927970 all of us are just really sad and down about it

5927979 not to mention the fact that when i got up there it was 7 0 all of a sudden
5927980 i might have found a guy although i think hes a complete tool hes like totally into me which is sadistic when i say i find it amusing but hes a rich toolbag
5927981 we usually always struggle at tracks like this these southern places
5927982 its just something about the dirt down here that we havent been able to really figure out but we finally got a good run
5927983 actually the feature was really fun im kinda looking forward20to coming back next year
5927984 i got by the 4 car driven by georgias jeremy faircloth for third but i had such a good run down the front straightaway i ended up pushing up in turns one and two
5927985 then he got back by me and shane clanton went by both of us
5927986 this is such an awesome sponsor for our team at bristol
5927987 the television series knight rider is a show that everyone can get hooked on i think its really cool that nbc has chosen to reinvent the series for the fall line up the best part about the show was always the car kitt and this is amazing that i get to drive a version of kitt for the night race at bristol its every guys dream to feel like they are an action hero and i get to have that chance under the lights of bristol with our no 28 knight rider ford
5927988 the stealth look and feel of the car coupled with travis kvapil at the helm has us very excited about this race
5927989 this event exemplifies the adrenalin and action the knight rider series will deliver and illustrates the strength and compatibility of our sponsor partnership with ford
5927990 weve been trying so hard to win a special show this year and now weve done it
5927991 only than finishing fourth in the dash because we went too soft on tires we did everything right all night
5927992 i was a little worried when i got up to second and rhebergen was already checked out on me in the lead but i knew our car was real good so i figured he must have been on soft tires
5927993 well once my 48s american racer tires started working i caught right up to him passed him and then checked out i ran side by side with richie gardner for a while when i was lapping him late in the race because i knew nobody could pass me if we were racing two wide but they told me scott johnson the eventual runner up was pretty far back anyway
5927994 weve run a lot of 50 lap races this year and ive learned a lot
5927995 i realized that you cant use up all your stuff running too hard early in the race so i was patient at eriez and kept the car under me i had plenty of car left after halfway
5927996 this was a tough week for us we tried a lot of different things and the guys did a really good job making the changes and working hard on this armor all chevy we just arent satisfied with anything but wins the frustrating part about this week is that we werent even contending for victories
5927997 well go back to the drawing board and see if we can come back next week in billings mont and edmonton and be back battling for wins we were really good the last time we were in billings august 2005 before a mechanical failure and won last year in edmonton so everyone will have high expectations i know this tony stewart racing crew ricky warner shane bowers and kyle sundby is up to the challenge and will continue to do everything it can to give me a good race car
5927998 we had a tough start to the week with the crash in fargo but the guys hung in there and we just kept getting better
5927999 i sure hope this is a sign of things to come we have a lot of great guys here at tony stewart racing and get great support from all of our sponsors backing us theyve all continued to stand behind us and it feels good to have a solid podium finish for them
5928000 hopefully we can take what we learned here and apply it in two weeks at du quoin state fairgrounds and hang on to the points lead
5928001 to do it in front of the home crowd is always exciting we started fourth and made the pass for the lead coming out of turn four on the first lap before we could complete the lap the caution came out and we had a complete restart i was able to do the exact same thing the second time we took the lead and we never had another caution we took the momentum we built at the shootout and went out to charlotte county and won the race by eight seconds thats pretty cool
5928002 the summer shootout is unlike any kind of racing series out there
5928003 if it was an all year deal we would be good from the beginning to the end you just come here and the track is different every week and theres always so much beating and banging that you never know what you can expect you just try to do what you can to hit that right setup we learned a lot and i know that well come back next year and try it all again to be even better than we were this year
5928004 it was an honor being able to run the 40 cent pro car this year for bdi racing it was a great opportunity that bob and the whole bdi racing team presented me this season and it was awesome going to buffalo wild wings every tuesday night win lose or draw to have some awesome wings and share some laughs with good friends
5928005 it was fun but i have to admit i am looking forward to getting back to pavement
5928006 thats what makes this so frustrating we had a fantastic car and i have no doubt that if the engine would not have failed we would have been battling kobyluck up front the team did a great job i had a lot of fun working with them this weekend
5928007 its ok it happens that was not your fault for sure
5928008 we had an unfortunate qualifying lap but my guys got the car back where it needed to be for the race im really happy with 13th considering we had to start in the back and it was my first experience on dirt
5928009 hats off to my guys who were forced to work even harder after qualifying to repair the damage done to my car
5928010 i really appreciate all their hard work today im looking forward to another dirt race in two weeks
5928011 with the new surface at bristol theres probably less bumping just because you dont have to bump a guy out of the way to get a position but i think its better racing for sure
5928012 no i dont enjoy the races where you have to bump somebody out of the way to pass them thats not any fun i dont think thats the right way to race its frustrating when thats the only way you can pass somebody
5928013 oh yeah its great this is the easiest most care free time that you could have in cup racing right now is being in the position where were in the chase and we dont have anything to lose thats great
5928014 oh yeah theres reason to try and do stuff anything you can try right now theres no down side theres only an up side
5928015 absolutely and thats part of the deal we like doing it and trying to get the drive one slogan out there is a great opportunity and im looking forward to having it on the car it looks great and its easy to help promote something when you truly believe it and i truly believe in ford
5928016 yeah ive been a little jealous with him getting the drive one on his car but i think the car looks awesome and im excited and honored to run it
5928017 yeah i think its created more grooves on the track you can run up high kind of in the middle or down low and still be competitive you dont have to hit them out of the way youll still see some bumping and banging because its a half mile race track with 43 competitive cars on it but maybe not as much what you will see is more side by side racing and i think thats equally as good for the fans to watch these cars are a little bit different but the gap from first to 43rd is closing each and every week and everybody is getting more and more competitive i think each week there is better racing
5928018 bristol is an exciting race track and with the excitement from the fans and from the community you get that kind of change going back to charlotte and atlanta motor speedway some of the places that i grew up as a young kid going to you see new stuff and exciting things and a different atmosphere every time you come to a place like that going to bristol is always one of the most fun weekends we make a whole weekend out of it watching the truck race and nationwide race and we have a lot of friends and family that come up when you have racing that exciting its gonna continue to grow if the racing is horrible at every other race track everybody is still gonna be at bristol
5928019 yeah and i just want to be a part of them i feel bad if i just have an easy race and finish 10th thats a good race but i want to be up in the battle beating and banging and have some controversy at the end of the race thats what its all about its fun thats what the fans love and thats what i loved as a fan watching the sport from years back
5928020 its just an unbelievable venue when you think that they can fit that many people in such a small area its just a great atmosphere its really loud and theres always a lot of action on the race track i had some fans in to watch the first race this year and they got debris in their beer can thats all they could talk about was how they were sitting so close that they got debris in their beer car so bristol is a great place its one of the best tracks we go to for feel because its just a great atmosphere
5928021 its a place i sure would love to win in my cup deal there i actually ran a special paint scheme with the punisher movie with the big skull on the hood and i ran third all the day behind rusty wallace i cant remember who led it was somebody rusty and me i ran third and i remember saying if i can follow rusty wallace at bristol im doing something right near the end of that race i finally thought hey we could win this thing yes bristol is definitely a track that you want to be able to say i gotta win that they dont have a really cool trophy like the grandfather clock or the guitar or the dover monster they dont have a cool trophy but its a bristol trophy when youve won there you know that youve tamed a beast thats pretty unbelievable
5928022 in the craftsman truck series nowadays pit strategy almost means nothing people pit once weve had a guy win a race in the last two years that didnt pit at all the pit strategy thing because how bad these goodyear tires have been its a long lost art of this series the key is to show up there with a truck that can win so you dont have to battle from the back the maxx force team the no 10 ford we seem to make an art out of stopping five times and still getting in the top 10 and top five i dont know how bryan berry does it i dont know how we do it but we tend to get ourselves up into it but we have to make a bunch of stops if we can ever have a day where we stop once we could probably go out and win a race so i think the whole goal is the preparation before you get there making sure that truck comes off the trailer prepared you dont have to make any big wild changes you start the race you stop once and you race for the win
5928023 that i can get through that guy whether i have to move him or not im going to get there
5928024 we had to stop the treatments at 10 it was a struggle to get her in for the last treatment
5928025 up until now it has been felipe massa and hamilton because raikkonens performance has been going up and down all the time

5928027 i think if we have sex more often our relationship might get better
5928028 who wants to look at the pictures from my new york city adventure
5928029 i think if we have sex more often our relationship might get better
5928030 although that may be true our troubles are not about sex that is just a symptom
5928031 last week when i took that trip stayed with our friends i asked everybody in the family if they wanted to see the pictures

5928044 i saw the volunteer ministers providing solutions to every problem that people were walking in with
5928045 whether physical whether mental any operational problem people had they had a solution
5928046 the volunteer ministers are a remarkable group of individuals whose purpose is truly to help improve conditions their focus is one of organization and coordination their self sufficiency and ability to direct all relief efforts is an indispensable asset to our country
5928047 this is the city l ron hubbard himself founder of the scientology religion selected as home to the first scientology organization this is also the city wherein he first defined the human spirit as an immortal being possessed of capabilities beyond anything predicted and so arrived at the axiomatic truths on which the whole of scientology is founded your early london organizations were also the original proving ground for the bulk of mr hubbards social betterment programs which are used to uplift neighborhoods just like this one
5928048 this church can restore what this world has lately lost namely much of the dignity and respect with which it was created
5928049 our gift of literacy to disadvantaged children restoring self respect to those whove gone astray easing suffering eradicating racial prejudice and repairing the bonds that bind man together
5928050 this new church packs the full body of l ron hubbards technologies as derived from the greater well of scientology knowledge
5928051 and as such it provides the full gamut of scientology activities for the betterment of mankind
5928052 it is vital that all thinking men urge upon their governments for the governments own sake if no other sweeping reforms in the field of human rights

5928058 secret non belligerence pact between the italian state and palestinian resistance organizations including terrorist groups
5928059 the terms of the agreement were that the palestinian organizations could even maintain armed bases of operation in the country and they had freedom of entry and exit without being subject to normal police controls because they were handled by the secret services
5928060 the palestinian organizations could even maintain armed bases of operation in the country

5928062 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5928063 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5928064 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

5928204 id love to see a point where roe v wade is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women to undergo illegal and dangerous operations

5928218 an individual who is more personally comfortable with blacks than with whites on an individual level need not hold political ideologies which support the separation of blacks and whites on a community level
5928219 i now believe it is incorrect to assume that just because a black individual does not enjoy or choose to participate in the culture of his people that that individual is not interested in benefiting that group of people
5928220 the inability to identify with one aspect of the black culture does not necessarily cause apathy towards blacks in general

5928249 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5928250 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5928251 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children

5928290 its quite difficult we had to shop around at the cheapest places and i had to stay under 100 on everything i get for one day
5928291 my friends and i have been talking about how were going to budget at school i think what were going to do is just take out a set amount of cash and have that for the week instead of charging everything because that can slip by you
5928292 so you just have to get it because you cant let them suffer as far as the budget something comes up short every month anyway
5928293 the his name again that black guy the one who speaks so well
5928294 i throw stuff at them that most people would walk away from
5928295 its ridiculous stuff they never know what theyre getting into on any given day they dont know what to expect and thats the point im working them in
5928296 i want to be a guy who gets looked upon to go into important situations
5928297 i feel i can do it its a matter of getting stronger and quicker ive been doing a lot of legwork this summer to get the quickness to pull away from other players
5928298 hartsburg may be a perfect fit for the senators at this point his background as a defenseman and his history of coaching just that good defense will be breath of fresh air in ottawa and he showed with the 2008 canadian wjc squad how much he stresses team first play this team may have dropped a bit in terms of pure talent but their leadership and defense are much better that bodes well for a sens team that still has the pieces to make a serious playoff run with a little more help at the trade deadline dont be surprised if they do
5928299 tsn announced a new channel today tsn2 which will launch aug 29 with live coverage of the u s open tennis tournament
5928300 perhaps our only fault or achilles heel has been frankly our number of conflicts as a result of the amount of programming we own and control
5928301 its unavoidable and we hate it more than the public does so this is a solution
5928302 where the hell are all the young people and um could we at least have some token people of color present
5928303 one of the more interesting ufas to be is ottawa tough guy chris neil due to hit the open market next summer neil currently earning a mere 1 1 million has a rare skill set thumping skating shooting that makes him a pleasure to watch and a beast to play when hes healthy and on his game hard to find comparables for neil there are so few like him the senators would be wise to re sign neil who should at least double his salary
5928304 you cant tell whether he had a great game or a not so good game he still looks the same the next day and as a goaltender thats obviously one of the things you have to have after a bad goal or a soft goal you have to be able to let it go and focus on the next save and i think hes doing a great job of that
5928305 from day one hes always been a guy whos had a very calm demeanour and he exudes confidence which i think carries over to the team hes very calm and thats a real interesting trait for someone whos as young as him especially when you look two years ago and he started playoff games and such and thats a big challenge for a young guy like that hes solid hes very mature for his age and hes done a great job for us
5928306 during a road trip to long island in october 2006 belfour and auld were
5928307 we were just horsing around with each other i dropped my bottle of water and we all slipped alex hit his head when we fell down thats the truth of the matter it was a pure accident there was no alcohol involved whatsoever
5928308 were going to handle this internally everything is fine ive been out on the ice so its not a big deal theres nothing that happened thats of anyones concern
5928309 according to two eyewitnesses at the garden city hotel in long island where the panthers were staying the incident happened after belfour became disruptive in a nightclub connected to the hotel causing a commotion when some teammates including auld tried to get him to leave and go to his room

5928311 die zukunft der medizin liegt nicht in der behandlung von krankheiten sondern im erkennen der ursachen von krankheiten
5928312 es mangelt der deutschen gesundheitspolitik nach wie vor an einer expliziten zielorientierung
5928313 keine definierten organisationsformen f r die vernetzten praxen die vielf ltigen und oft sehr unterschiedlichen aktivit ten seien eher als bewegung zu verstehen

5928319 one prospects website hockeys future talked to a senior nhl scout who said hed have no hesitation telling his team to pick 6 foot 5 swedish defenceman victor hedman ahead of tavares
5928320 but nothing hedman does this week will impact his stock too much he already has proven to many scouts that he is a potential franchise defenseman hedman is a mobile 6 foot 6 defenseman who already is drawing comparisons to nhl standout chris pronger at 17 he was playing full time for modo in swedens elite league a rarity in a league considered to be not that far removed from the caliber of the nhl this season he will see even more ice time with the senior team hedman can already dominate a game with his brawn skill set and hockey smarts he is already far ahead of any other player for the no 1 ranking among draft eligible europeans
5928321 so besides unsubstantiated rumours what grave sins has emery committed
5928322 it was a little over four years ago when curtis hunt entered the vip room at the brandt centre with a concealed hand nervously gripping one of his most treasured childhood mementos
5928323 hes going to work for an ex pat which can never hurt
5928324 were extremely happy for curtis but on the other side of the coin we know were losing a very good coach a quality person and for myself personally a good friend
5928325 emerys reputation was as a man who hung out with a group on the fringe rockers rappers party people he liked that crowd and they liked having him around
5928326 i was running around here and there girls and this and that a lot of kind of bull around me
5928327 i dont think that i was any different than a majority of other guys that have played or are playing who are my age as far as that goes but i really put myself out there i made it so all eyes were on me
5928328 hes tattooed up everybody knows who he is he couldnt get away from it
5928329 ray emerys a good guy and it went right around the room i wasnt the only guy that liked him he wasnt a distraction at all
5928330 ottawa a dramatic change in the senators third jersey will see a predominantly black uniform with the word
5928331 edmonton the oilers are going back to their glory days with the predominantly blue jersey wayne gretzky mark messier et al wore on the road while winning five stanley cup titles between 1984 and 1990 orange shoulder piping will re appear along with a broad orange stripe at the tip of each arm two white stripes flanking an orange stripe are on the arms and near the bottom of the jersey the original round oilers logo with the orange oil drip and blue team name is on the front
5928332 actually gord i have to tell you hes a cerebral guy hes a very very smart guy
5928333 for detroit red wings fans theres a sense of anger on display over on abel to yzerman thats reminiscent of eric manginis departure to the new york jets the notion that a championship team just lost a key member of its staff to a division rival and that he took his institutional knowledge of his former franchise with him lets just hope mike babcock doesnt go out and buy a camcorder to complete the pats jets comparison no ones saying that adding scotty bowman to the front office puts the blackhawks on the level of the red wings but adding that level of insider insight will certainly add a bit of intrigue when the two teams meet its a great day for chicago hockey
5928334 in my opinion the most valuable player in the ducks defeat of ottawa to capture the cup was samuel pahlsson a small speedy defensive center from sweden who most fans probably wouldnt recognize if he showed up at their front door when ottawas top line featuring daniel alfredsson was matched against him they found a defender they couldnt escape everywhere they turned with his speed and agility pahlsson was there soon the sens stars got frustrated started gambling and turning the puck over generating counterattacks and beating themselves
5928335 webster has yet to think up a word strong enough for the utter loathing i have for you
5928336 its ok that i imagine you falling down an open elevator shaft right
5928337 i dreamt i killed you last night i cried when i woke up and realized it didnt happen
5928338 theres no easy way to tell you this but im contemplating shoving you into oncoming traffic
5928339 kill yourself for the future of humanity god rewards martyrs
5928340 sometimes i think you only hang around for the emotional abuse i provide in your sad and pathetic life
5928341 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet

5928344 it does not take a rocket scientist to identify add characteristics in yourself or in another never in my forty years of counseling child development and human behavior work have i seen as high a level of accurate self recognition as i have with attention deficit disorder if you identify with what you read from a list of attributes of add you can be sure you are a person with an add style of brain construction
5928345 because there are no exact criteria for add it cant be said that you

5928355 its amazing that with the election as close as it is we have so few policies that we can bank on
5928356 uncertainty from the election has been one factor thats weighed on the markets
5928357 we handicap the outcome as investors to take the worst case scenario

5928364 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5928365 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5928366 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5928367 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5928368 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5928369 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5928370 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5928371 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5928372 our clothing is an effort by our organization to provide our service members with symbols of our support and gratitude for their service it is our hope that they provide a tangible reminder of how grateful every american is for their sacrifice and give them an added measure of comfort as they return to everyday life

5928376 as a b to c company we have to have a better understanding of what our end users are using
5928377 dad im the definition of strange why did you ever see joe or john come out of their room when something really great happened to them run through the house run into your room to announce what happened and then go back to their room like nothing happened
5928378 i dont hate alex though hes scared of me huh
5928379 dad you dont give him the chance to say anything you dont have that friendly aura
5928380 well he started the conversation so i just played along in kind
5928381 well he does walk 40 minutes from his house to ours
5928382 and he does spend money on the bus just to see me too
5928383 its just im so used to seeing you as a little girl
5928384 but youre 15 now and you know im really protective
5928385 but seeing you on his lap or on the bed with him is inappropriate
5928386 alex has common sense so he knows if he does something wrong hes dead
5928387 yeah all of my guns are stashed under the dinner table under the carpets and in the computer desk drawer better watch out
5928388 its going to be 8 months soon i cant believe its been this long already
5928389 yeah but you were chasing after him for months werent you
5928390 if you want something go get it and if it means that much to you you wont give up
5928391 well that wire had two ends and the outlet has two holes
5928392 i didnt feel like it so i stayed at home
5928393 when i look at you i cant keep stiiiiill youre my thrill
5928394 tax rebates peter out building a new bridge helps the economy long after the work is done
5928395 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5928396 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5928397 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5928398 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5928399 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5928400 please forgive me if i sound rude but you keep writing my profile states that i do not return correspondence from people without pictures on their profiles and if you truly wanted to know me you would have taken a moment to read at least what i wrote about myself thank you for your compliments and have a great week
5928401 its the net people lie therefore i can freely ask for what i want on my profile should someone choose not to provide it its their choice and if i choose to move on thats mine too that has nothing to do with vanity its more like if a man is not comfortable enough in his own skin to post a full picture of himself he is not confident enough to be with me i like strong confident men with a great outlook on life and that can formulate a lucid sentence and from the way your last mail read thats not you
5928402 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5928403 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5928404 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5928405 one may use the radio a cell phone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a sling box and perhaps a satellite tv feed
5928406 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle
5928407 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race we would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at nbc
5928408 its a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with but really loves you then you become real
5928409 you become it takes a long time thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and youreyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand
5928410 vibrant communities strong economy and a highly educated workforce all the things weve been bragging about for years
5928411 the idea that leaders of this party could meet for four days and have nothing but silence to greet them is unacceptable
5928412 we have a responsibility to speak out we have a right to be heard
5928413 theres a delicate balance between providing a safe and secure event and allowing people their first amendment rights
5928414 i can always sell water and pop sit in the middle and take money from both sides
5928415 people come here a little bit skeptical but leave saying wow
5928416 when that gavel goes down you cannot not have goose bumps
5928417 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5928418 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5928419 damn she murders this live its better than on the album
5928420 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of

5928422 zou has a lot of pressure because all the boxers know that he is the world champion
5928423 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5928424 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of russia
5928425 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5928426 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal

5928435 keep doing things what you want and feel so happy and you will find your own way

5928450 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole
5928451 she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5928452 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here
5928453 this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5928454 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5928455 rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual
5928456 maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick
5928457 they want to knock that smile off her face so she shuts her door and writes some dreams its her favorite escape

5928465 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
5928466 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
5928467 the old futures dead and gone never to return theres a new way through the hills ahead this one well have to earn this one well have to earn
5928468 oh god of abundance i began you feed us every day
5928469 as i interpreted it jesus invited notorious wrongdoes to his table airily discarding all the religious rules of the day and fed whoever showed up by the thousands in the end he was murdered for eating with the wrong people
5928470 i was going to get communion whether i wanted it or not with people i didnt necessarily like the people god chose for me
5928471 the word of god donald said is whats heard by the people of god when the bible is read that meant the word was living not because it was magical but because over and over down the centuries believers wrestled with texts adapted them edited them interpreted them swallowed them whole an spat them out the stories in the bible were records of human attempts to understand god attempts that were hopelessly incomplete but through words and acts we kept trying

5928478 it was at that moment when i flung my fling out the door
5928479 the importance of ethics in school business and our community
5928480 we do not have to put this house in the market i can get a job
5928481 what do i want to do with the rest of my life
5928482 so brother in law was right we didnt believe him when he told us how much he was making after he got the ph d i think he was a postdoc we thought he was lying
5928483 that was roughly as long as the one they use to launch the space shuttle
5928484 it depends on the time of year whether its flu season time for seasonal allergies or with our younger population time for physicals
5928485 we cant treat sprains strains or fractures because we have no x ray machines
5928486 the other things that people ask for all the time and that we dont do are pain medications especially for migraines
5928487 for those who dont know what our service includes an electronic message board spools the information and some people just want direction on what the next step in taking care of themselves would be
5928488 are great for people who are relatively healthy but once youre taking multiple medications or have multiple chronic conditions you should be seeing your primary care doctor
5928489 if you dont have a medical home we try to direct you toward one
5928490 god often uses us at our point of greatest incompetence
5928491 one of the great mistakes we make is asking god to do for us what god wants us to do for him
5928492 when you give beyond your ability god will bless you beyond your ability
5928493 we become so fixated on past mistakes that we forfeit future opportunities
5928494 you cant do the will of god if you dont have the heart of god
5928495 indecision is a decision and it is our indecision not our bad decisions that keeps us in the cage
5928496 the difference between where you are and where god wants you to be may be the painful decision you refuse to make
5928497 you have to stop repeating the past and start creating the future
5928498 quando eu era jovem a situa o era muito ruim meus movimentos meu controle n o eram muito bons e eu estava sempre trocando de t cnico

5928511 semalam seperti biasa dia nongkrong bersama teman temanya di simpang lima merah senen jalan kwitang raya
5928512 mursandi beberapa hari ini memang sering jalan dengan cewek padahal yanto juga ngejar cewek itu
5928513 katanya dia mau buat buku tapi dia nggak ceritakan banyak lihat sendiri kalau sudah jadi
5928514 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
5928515 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
5928516 hes a real good pitcher i hope he opts out of his deal
5928517 the real issue is that peoples incomes havent risen with the rents
5928518 its not like they can go and get a second job or expect a raise
5928519 why is all this luxury housing being built and not middle class housing
5928520 are you going to run for mayor or do you have a phone problem
5928521 your past is where it is in the past it cant hurt you i have to tell myself that all the time seriously everyday
5928522 im not going to make any formal announcement or anything until these november races are over
5928523 its something ive been interested in and i believe id bring a calming effect over knox county
5928524 a lot of things you do in government a lot of times it takes a phone call or somebody to go visit a bureaucrat in some back office to get it resolved
5928525 im a hands on kind of guy as far as people go i dont mind meeting with people
5928526 in the past republicans were in the minority and i was still passing 30 or 40 bills a year
5928527 the more we thought about it we really couldnt think of any cons hopefully this will take off
5928528 this is kind of ground zero for a lot of great places to go
5928529 the people i expect to participate in this are families and couples who dont have a bicycle or have a bicycle but dont have the means to get it downtown
5928530 really we just wanted to provide the service to the citizens
5928531 let the rest of tennessee be the obese people anybody can do it everybody can do it
5928532 usually we find drugs and usually theres a charge or arrest in this case there was none the dog did indicate on the truck so theres a very high probability that the money at some point has been in contact with drugs
5928533 it will go before the courts and probably be awarded to the different agencies that participated
5928534 it appears there are several courts across the country in the last couple of months that have addressed this
5928535 it appears all of them found in opposition to your position mr brown
5928536 an 18 year old who stole a bicycle from ever possessing a firearm
5928537 because we have the same interest that you do to provide public transit to as many people at as inexpensive a cost as possible
5928538 but we as the city because we answer to taxpayers we have to make the budget balance budgets matter
5928539 we also need to come up with a policy for how the lift is going to work
5928540 is there some way we can make it less fragile or stop making the expectations so high
5928541 knoxville is a great place to visit and learn particularly for the african american community
5928542 we have a lot of places to visit but people have to know where these places are we can let them know in an entertaining way with this new venue they can learn something about the alex haley statue they can learn something about old citys history which was the heart of african american commerce prior to about 1963
5928543 they can learn about the old gem theatre which was at the corner of vine and central now central and summit hill all this and more exists on the wireless network now being established
5928544 it was a logical step for us to be involved in cultural heritage tourism
5928545 certainly the voice of the african american community is a voice that has not been heard as it should be so the ability to promote the voices of that community is wonderful
5928546 its a collaboration where all the partners are working for the common good concerning the cultural heritage of knoxville and east tennessee
5928547 it will be a very positive development hopefully this whole process will constantly evolve
5928548 we found out early on that the information in the cultural heritage tours was not only going to be accurate but also represented very well
5928549 we also found out that there was a capability to have other tours built from this program which got us even more exited we can start with the kaatch process as a base and then work with other tours
5928550 i wonder how well pakistans nuclear weapons are secured compared to ours especially at a time like this
5928551 its not iraq or afghanistan where we do see a path forward where we do see success it is pakistan
5928552 were not sure of the outcome in pakistan its very very unstable
5928553 but then again his control of the military in pakistan has been a stabilizing factor because when you have 168 million people the sixth largest country in the world and you have the taliban coming through the mountains from afghanistan and frankly taking your own security people hostage you have a very troubling security environment
5928554 and security is paramount to their economy coming around right now their economy is going in the wrong direction after a few years of growth
5928555 so its very unstable insecure in a country like pakistan they could be weeks away from chaos or improvement we dont know which thats what makes it so volatile thats whats so dangerous about pakistan today in the middle of this upheaval a civilian government was elected and thats great but security is also incredibly important and somehow the security leadership and the civil government leadership are going to have to come together as quick as possible our country better watch closely the events in pakistan because its a linchpin in that region
5928556 i didnt know you had to be chosen to go to the olympics
5928557 yeah thought like you could sign up at some community centre or some shit
5928558 its an unprecedented collaboration between the private sector and the science sector
5928559 it can be a model for the rest of the country
5928560 there are a lot of dollar signs sitting under that graveled park
5928561 the vacancy in the office of general sessions court judge should be filled by appointment of the county commission with such appointee to serve until a successor is elected at the biennial election in august 2010 and qualified
5928562 once you see them you can easily recognize her style
5928563 i research the plants and animals and try to add as much information as possible
5928564 the kids actually read it i think it creates sort of a subliminal message
5928565 so far most of the work ive done has held up pretty well over the years
5928566 one time i painted a room with a 60 foot ceiling
5928567 early to bed early to rise work like hell and organize
5928568 the best way to keep 4 gasoline coming down and the best way to stop spending billions of dollars overseas for oil and other energy to countries that dont much like us is to keep our brainpower advantage
5928569 you can make cheese in your own home its not difficult to do
5928570 to be honest with you i was disappointed i dont think the cheeses that won are better than ours our cheese was just barely four months old next year i will send them a six month old wheel and it will win
5928571 sam beall proprietor of blackberry farm has given me a wonderful opportunity
5928572 i did a little research on blount county and found that sheep was a very vital part of this countys economy for quite a long time
5928573 there are area roads named after sheep like mutton hollow road and lamb road and you can find a lot of old photos of sheep being pastured in fields like the bald and spence field
5928574 the milk will coagulate on its own but you have to wait who knows how long
5928575 this helps cheese makers control the acidity of the curd
5928576 it definitely doesnt need to go into the septic system
5928577 my friends and neighbors live in town and i want to share what i do with them for me its just as important to make the community happy as it is to please our guests
5928578 due to operating inefficiencies and the slower than anticipated recovery in the north american truck market as well as performance issues in the companys south korean business
5928579 the actual closure date has not been finalized and is subject to change but will likely occur towards the end of calendar 2008
5928580 the decision to lay off employees in knoxville while difficult was necessary to support our continuing efforts to control costs and optimize asset utilization
5928581 its crazy around here it will settle down by friday
5928582 owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country
5928583 ive grouped them together because they need to be together for association and language
5928584 it also gives the esl teacher the chance to go into the classroom and teach them right there
5928585 other kids and teachers in the school look for their work because its just so outstanding
5928586 if we come to a point in the future where the newcomer class is needed then i think well be ready to do what we need to do
5928587 sitting stationary in a chair in a semi conscious state
5928588 the information will hopefully provide insight into erics unfortunate accident and death
5928589 we will continue to hopefully obtain answers to these questions that the family needs in order to not only provide closure for erics situation but to also ensure this situation never happens to another student in knox county or elsewhere
5928590 apparently eric law remained on the pavement for a significant period of time before he was taken inside the school building by fellow students
5928591 look at all the appropriate policies and review them as part of the investigation we do that anytime theres an incident that would warrant that
5928592 if a student suffers an injury or becomes ill the staff member in charge shall have the responsibility to render first aid or ensure that it is rendered in the event of serious injury or illness to a student the parent s shall be notified as to whether to pick up the child at school or meet the child at the hospital
5928593 tendency to make statements or promises that were not in line with procedures policies and regulations
5928594 a lack of focus when it comes to staying in class and meeting the standards set out by knox county schools
5928595 what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5928596 theres no doubt that there should be criminal charges because from the very beginning to the end all of the parents were purposely lied to
5928597 we were promised that three tour guides or camp counselors would be taking care of the children plus there would be medical care as well
5928598 this woman knew from the beginning that she wouldnt be able to provide it
5928599 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5928600 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5928601 it stratford is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and lived all my life
5928602 that would be quite something to come out on the track and compete in front of my home fans cathy freeman all over again
5928603 holy crap that first movie was awesome but the next two couldnt have sucked harder if a worm hole married a black hole
5928604 any establishment which dispenses food for consumption on or off the premises and which has the following characteristics a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
5928605 theres really very little doubt that theyve been successful at that
5928606 commitment to carry on the fight against the criminal hordes until their elimination
5928607 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this
5928608 aber wir halten uns an den alten spruch wer k mpft kann verlieren wer nicht k mpft hat schon verloren
5928609 wir best tigen nicht dass herr markschies f r das bischofsamt kandidiert
5928610 das kreuz hat der stadt gefehlt nun ist das sichtbare zeichen f r christen wieder da
5928611 dann verschwindet auch der baukranz und alles ist wie neu

5928614 i know you are great computer gamer so here you go
5928615 everybody knows you can go to space if you are a perfect physical specimen and incredibly smart
5928616 that term implies you are there to take photos and hang out
5928617 im trying to prove you can actually be a valuable contributor to the activities on board the space station
5928618 id be misleading you if i didnt admit that its a very selfish activity
5928619 there are a million ways i can screw up and kill everyone
5928620 die algerische bev lkerung ist ein weiteres mal opfer blinder und barbarischer terroristischer gewalt geworden
5928621 personal criticism of your opponent is almost always going to cause a backlash unless you can find a way to link it to a policy matter
5928622 and these celebrity ads particularly the follow up ones have done an outstanding job of linking criticisms personally to obamas policy credentials
5928623 if they would have continued to run ads with paris and britney it would have trivialized the point they were trying to make
5928624 but they used the two girls to grab peoples attention and then shifted in the next ads to a more direct link between obamas own celebrity and his lack of policy chops
5928625 akshay kumar is an inspiration for me he has handled his career beautifully im envious of him
5928626 exige que las acciones preventivas y o reparadoras de da os medio ambientales se adopten de manera inminente
5928627 lo que no quiere decir que no pueda cometer atentados
5928628 porque lo que se est haciendo es aplicar la ley
5928629 ahora mismo la estrategia es para las obras y esperar tiempos mejores claro que para eso tienes que ser una empresa a la que su suelo no le pida comida en el sentido de que no tenga demasiadas obligaciones en pr stamos bancarios en ese caso puedes capear la crisis el gran problema son las promotoras que paran porque realmente no tienen dinero para continuar la obra pero que tienen que seguir pagando mes a mes a los bancos
5928630 en m laga existe una poblaci n que solicita vivienda j venes inmigrantes personas que se divorcian y confiamos en que las ventas se retomen
5928631 algunos empresarios est n dispuestos a renunciar a buena parte de sus beneficios con tal de dar salida a las casas
5928632 its not but its a film that has tremendous international appeal theres an audience for this film beyond india
5928633 its a period film set in 1905 in kolkata its about a child and the telephone invention its a fairytale in fact farhan wanted to make this film immediately after dil chahta hai
5928634 zoya has been working on the script since last five years its about the film industry that she has seen since her childhood in the 1970s till now its about a struggling actor farhan akhtar a superstar hrithik roshan a punjabi producer rishi kapoor a junior artiste konkona sen sharma plus a whole lot of stars making special appearances including aamir and shah rukh khan
5928635 the happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything they just
5928636 people who live on earth their souls is tied up by gravity you understand
5928637 i sympathize with this idea maybe in the future people should live in the space
5928638 i imagined that i was driving in the playstation game ridge racer
5928639 i must ask you to direct that the money be returned to them forthwith
5928640 we cannot under any circumstances afford to take a contribution which can be even improperly construed as putting us under an improper obligation
5928641 the truth of the matter is that roosevelt today would be on the left
5928642 the wilderness warrior theodore roosevelts and the crusade for america
5928643 when pelican island celebrated its centennial the u s national wildlife refuge system comprised over 540 wildlife refuges on more than 95 million acres
5928644 when writing or lecturing about american birds roosevelt often turned downright lyrical sometimes achieving the level of song
5928645 im my biggest critic whenever i go out with my friends to watch my film i keep looking for flaws i look critically the way i look in the film or the way i act
5928646 my mother is very biased towards me my parents always wanted me to learn moralistic values as a child and even now i have been a big fan of my fathers films
5928647 i have watched my moms films but i was not comfortable people would judge her and i dont like anyone else judging my mother i am possessive about her

5928650 alguien me habl de las pobres cifras de visitas que recibe un museo arqueol gico y por eso pens que lo mejor ser a el parque de los cuentos por la cantidad de colegios que recibir a
5928651 no hay ning n par n se encarg el proyecto al equipo ganador de arquitectos y ten an tres meses para preparar el material gr fico y seis meses para el proyecto de ejecuci n
5928652 estas se concretan en leer crear escuchar y conocer y con estas acciones se acondicionar n los espacios del edificio
5928653 hemos tenido la paciencia de un franciscano hemos esperado los dos a os que marcaba el estatuto y ahora no tiene sentido negociar tres meses m s
5928654 una separaci n clara entre el papel de la generalitat y los partidos
5928655 till date i have followed a simple adage apni tareef maine kabhi kari nahi aur naa hi doosro ki buraai i have neither hailed myself nor pulled anyone down the same remains the case even after singh is kinng i stay on as the same simple person in spite of being in the industry for more than 30 years and rest assured i would be the same till i make my last film i was accessible yesterday i am approachable today as well
5928656 for none of these films did i have ever face any kind of pressure in fact it was for the first time in case of singh is kinng when i did start getting nervous pangs but that was again before the release of the film and not during the shoot i was chilled out during the process of making the film but it was only a month before the release that i started wondering whether the film would meet the huge expectations that all the buzz hype and the track record of all of us associated with the film was generating it was a welcome relief to be a part of such an unprecedented response
5928657 in fact for the first time ever in my career as a director i am under pressure and let me be fair to the boy because it has nothing to do with him it is more to do with an image that i am carrying now after no entry welcome and singh is kinng people out here have started expecting and rightly so that i should be giving a blockbuster with every film of mine of course it is a great feeling of pride if they show such trust in you but in such cases you cant help but get ready for the pressure situation
5928658 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n
5928659 tenemos miedo a que en el futuro haya hospitales para cristianos y otros para musulmanes
5928660 todo es para proteger a los musulmanes pobres de los cristianos ricos que les compran sus rganos y al rev s
5928661 impedir cualquier intento de enga ar a los enfermos y robarles sus rganos sobre todo si ocurre entre cristianos y musulmanes porque en este caso s abre la puerta a una crisis entre ambas comunidades
5928662 instigar a la discriminaci n entre un musulm n y un cristiano que viven en el mismo pa s
5928663 cuando o el primer disparo pens que era un cazador y fui a llamarle la atenci n pero el segundo ya lo o dentro de la casa

5928665 la acci n militar de rusia ha sido desproporcionada y contraria con su papel de mantenimiento de la paz as como incompatible con los principios de la resoluci n pac fica de conflictos
5928666 seriamente las implicaciones de las acciones rusas en su relaci n con la otan
5928667 es el momento de que el presidente ruso dimitri medv dev cumpla los compromisos
5928668 fuerzas rusas est n ocupando una parte importante de georgia
5928669 palabrer a pues nadie quiere ni puede romper lazos con rusia
5928670 el equipo tiene que ser fuerte atr s es lo m s importante este a o y a partir de ah ser fuerte arriba
5928671 yo al toreo llego casi sin darme cuenta por la vinculaci n que hab a en mi casa al mundo del toro hoy para m torear significa estar vivo el torero tiene que nacer es cierto que se puede llegar a torear un toro pero si en tu interior no tienes una necesidad de expresar con la tauromaquia puedes torear un toro pero no ser torero
5928672 hay muchas clases de miedo supongo que hay un miedo f sico al dolor hay otro miedo a la responsabilidad otro a no estar en un determinado momento creativo o capaz de conmover el miedo a sentirte t a gusto y que la gente no se emocione el miedo no hay que superarlo hay que convivir en continuo di logo con l de hecho hay veces que me da miedo no tener ning n miedo una tarde que voy a torear mucha gente trata de definir que est s pasando mucho miedo en un momento determinado y no te conocen no saben cu ndo realmente lo est s pasando mal despu s est el valor que es traspasar el d a a d a f sico de tu cuerpo para crear una obra desde lo m s profundo de ti ese es el valor verdadero otro valor lo desconozco no s qu tipo de valor es hincarse de rodillas para m eso no es valor yo no lo hago porque no lo siento otras cosas como torear muy despacio me hacen m s medir la balanza del valor
5928673 en el triunfo la mayor a de las veces lo que sientes es la satisfacci n de la gente que te importa de verdad de tus amigos de tu familia yo realmente en el triunfo siento como si no hubiera pasado nada me quedo vac o tambi n siento tranquilidad y sosiego y mucho respeto por la persona que se ha sentido bien en la plaza e intranquilidad por aquellos a los que no he conseguido conmover
5928674 cuando las cosas no salen bien se siente una tristeza tremenda porque hay momentos en los que el cuerpo est magn fico el alma est creadora parece que vuelas que el capote y la muleta son una prolongaci n de tu creaci n interna pero sale un toro que no embiste o hace un aire horrible y no puedes torear y eso te deja totalmente destruido y encima hay veces que todo el mundo malinterpreta lo que est pasando
5928675 cuando toreas sobre todo lo que m s sufre es tu cuerpo cuando te rompes con un toro te destroza f sicamente y el que m s da o se hace eres t tambi n hay momentos en los que hay gente en la plaza que me inspira y me alerta a que no espere que sucedan las cosas sino que empuje yo para que sucedan
5928676 la familia lo es todo mi familia y mis amigos significan mi profesi n la tauromaquia mis sue os mi tranquilidad todo cuando me voy a torear y a hacer lo que m s siento que es el toreo son horas que le quito a mi familia y lo nico que intento a diario es que los que quiero y me quieren est n lo m s cerca de m posible y ahora que tengo mujer e hijos m s me gusta que el toreo no me distancie de mi familia
5928677 el momento de m s incertidumbre el d a que toreo es cuando estoy esperando en el hotel a que vengan los banderilleros a contarme cu les y c mo son los toros que me han tocado a ra z de que me entero de los toros que me han tocado sin verlos ya empiezo a dibujar en mi cabeza lo que puede ser la tarde yo s de la manera en que tocan a la puerta por quien entra primero en la habitaci n de la forma en la que me hablan si el lote es bueno o no luego nunca se sabe pero los profesionales siempre conocen al animal y conocen si pueden embestir
5928678 ser torero fuera de la plaza es ser un hombre con principios con educaci n con respeto ser buena persona un buen padre un hombre respetuoso para m eso es lo que significa lo de ir alardeando por ah de que eres torero es rid culo yo el d a que no toreo toreo en mi imaginaci n lo que no s es si el d a que deje de torear mi cuerpo vivir y sentir de la misma manera que cuando toreaba
5928679 un d a indultas a un toro y otro d a no te da tiempo de esquivar una almohadilla y te da en la cara yo he sentido las dos cosas y s lo que es tener los pies en el suelo me encantar a que esto fuera la funci n de teatro m s respetuosa del mundo porque es la m s real y que no hubiera agresiones ni f sicas ni verbales aunque no cabe duda de que el enfado del p blico es soberano pero la adulaci n est claro es para quien quiera escucharla
5928680 la tortuga se negaba a comer mucho a moverse y no mostraba inter s por su entorno
5928681 lo m s importante de mi toreo es que trato de hacer las cosas con naturalidad no hay que buscar nunca las posturas forzadas ni hacer cosas que uno no sienta hay que procurar torear lo m s despacio posible
5928682 es extremadamente honrado en el ruedo y esa honradez la lleva hasta l mites que no son razonables pero claro es que el toreo no es algo que se entienda con la raz n
5928683 esta profesi n no puede ser una rutina nunca cada tarde es diferente y uno tiene que tener ilusi n por crear si no se tiene ilusi n es dif cil que puedas conseguir poner el alma en lo que haces
5928684 no hay dinero y los bancos est n esperando a que pase agosto para obligar a muchas a acogerse al concurso de acreedores
5928685 es una irresponsabilidad que ha provocado que todas las personas que quer an comprar casa se hayan guardado el dinero esperando que los precios bajaran por arte de magia y eso ha terminado de hundir a un sector que ven a ya tocado
5928686 communities of people who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others
5928687 social media is an umbrella term that defines the various activities that integrate technology social interaction and the construction of words pictures videos and audio
5928688 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favour of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5928689 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5928690 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5928691 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5928692 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5928693 jos organisaatio ei osaa huomioida vaikkapa nuorten tarpeita sen on hyv kuulla se

5928701 all of a sudden the students seemed to be getting far less and it was costing far more and we werent getting any answers
5928702 the stock market had been going up during those years
5928703 we were asking how come there was so much less money in the fund but it was very difficult to get our calls returned
5928704 questions concerning administration of the fund were left unanswered documentation was not provided and the stellar reputation of the fund established to honor plaintiffs father was becoming badly tarnished
5928705 administration costs rose dramatically comprising a disproportionate amount of expense
5928706 since the education partnership took over we dont see any financial performance figures no publicity or advertising about the scholars nor get to even meet with or speak to any of the finalists as we always did before plus fending off complaints from scholars about non receipt of their scholarship funds and an inability to even see simple records without a fuss
5928707 to not release unaudited financial information with regard to its assets or performance
5928708 in light of your ongoing displeasure with and disruption of the education partnerships louis feinstein scholarship fund we are disassociating ourselves with you
5928709 would shatter the expectations of those who generously donate their money and efforts only to find themselves expendable once the administrator has the funds within its control
5928710 we may not have been able to resuscitate the man in time as a father im proud of what he did
5928711 i was talking to the guy for like three minutes
5928712 i showed him where the big rocks were so he brought his nephew out there with him
5928713 when we got out there i was holding onto the buoys and he just started going under he disappeared
5928714 it looked like the man was just about to go sleep
5928715 all i see is his face in the water and he didnt come back up
5928716 i didnt see him for about 30 seconds or something
5928717 and then i see him floating up i start yelling lifeguard lifeguard
5928718 my wife heard my son scream for help screaming for the lifeguard i saw him flailing his arms in the air
5928719 tapped me on the shoulder i backed off then and there and just helped keep everybody at bay while the nurse and lifeguard were reviving
5928720 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5928721 if the stocks drop i expect crude prices to rise but it will be within the 118 120 a barrel range if the stocks increase or are flat i expect prices to be around the 112 113 a barrel level
5928722 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel
5928723 people are going to be looking at the gas numbers
5928724 just as the market overshot to the upside it overshot the other way
5928725 it looks like were consolidating between us 112 and us 118
5928726 i think credit markets need to improve in the u s before we see a sustained rally in the dollar

5928728 we are reluctant to raise prices in japan because the market is so sluggish

5928770 i am surprised hes holding out i dont know where hes getting his advice hes played four years and hes played every game once and hes been hurt three times i know if i was in the front office even if it wasnt steven even if it was someone else on another team it would behard for me to justify giving them a lot of money regardless if he was the team
5928771 its just unfortunate that sometimes and its happened to a lot of great players when they play behind a player that had length and longetivity and did it well in a way that people respect they sometimes dont know how to deal with it they dont know where to take it and thats one of those situations where hes trying to carve a niche for himself and he wants that to be so different from me that hes doing a lot of things that i didnt do but those are the things i didnt do because you dont need to not because i didnt want to
5928772 mornings and afternoons be very regimented very organised very structured its very disciplined sometimes the english cant take that
5928773 despite st ambroses lack of preparation time i thought they pt up a good fight
5928774 we executed very cleanly and i was proud of the effort especially our simplicity of play
5928775 in one very short week the boys have already began to understand the importance of working for each other and not trying to reinvent the wheel
5928776 after we took our first 11 out it was a great opportunity for young players to prove that they could step in and be a part of the plan the maturity that ted schliesman and phil webber gave us was especially key 18 year olds tend to be somewhat nervous and those upperclassmen lent a calming effect to the team
5928777 if we continue to play as cleanly as we did tonight i think we could be a force to be reckoned with in the valley

5928779 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5928780 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5928781 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5928782 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5928783 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5928784 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed

5928786 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5928787 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5928788 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease

5928957 for if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart and knows all things
5928958 last june palestinian television broadcast a sermon in a gaza mosque in which the imam ibrahim madi made the following statement
5928959 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places therefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
5928960 that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
5928961 stand therefore having girded your waist with truth having put on the breastplate of righteousness
5928962 god made jesus who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
5928963 for if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart and knows all things
5928964 yup satan you are right i could have said that better i could have acted kinder i shouldnt have done that but i repent before god right now thank you heavenly father for forgiving me and helping me to handle that better next time i receive and thank you for your forgiveness in jesus name now satan shut up and flee i am made right before god you will never be right before god i will spend eternity with jesus you are condemned to the lake of fire i rebuke you in jesus name i praise the name of jesus
5928965 squeeze my fingers keep going ok uhuh youve got some weakness on the right side
5928966 theres some unevenness in strength more weakness on the right
5928967 yes i believe you have a little something going on here
5928968 it must have been love but its over now it must have been good but i lost it somehow

5928970 this misguided policy will increase ticket prices for consumers and hurt struggling small market airports while doing nothing to relieve or mitigate delays
5928971 this is a tragedy anytime somebody dies anytime somebodys killed thats a tragedy but one has a right to act in self defense
5928972 he was traumatized and upset about what had happened and had been up all night long and he had several drinks
5928973 there does not appear to be any pattern of any type where there is an attempt to harm someone
5928974 rummaging around in the drivers license records and those types of things
5928975 there is at this point no evidence whatsoever any public officials were targeted or any political maneuverings going on
5928976 i know anything that involves the thp is juicy fodder
5928977 but the last couple of years theyve done an awful lot to clean that place up
5928978 with enough people and enough lawsuits like this the city will see a need to change policy
5928979 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5928980 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5928981 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5928982 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5928983 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5928984 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5928985 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5928986 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5928987 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5928988 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5928989 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5928990 it is unreasonable to expect that another expert witness could step in at this juncture
5928991 if these allegations prove true its a horrendous case a horrendous situation
5928992 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5928993 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5928994 my liberal nasa engineer sister says that she cant vote for obama
5928995 theres a certain trust you have with a company in terms of needing to send confidential information so it can be used in generated reports but its with the obligation that that information is kept secure
5928996 review the incident and evaluate our security and policy procedures
5928997 with the preparations that we have had im sure we will make kenyans proud all the three of us running in the 800 metres
5928998 it took me 16 years to break the previous world record and i hope it takes longer than that to break mine
5928999 i would never die for my beliefs because i might be wrong
5929000 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5929001 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5929002 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5929003 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5929004 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5929005 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5929006 i wanted them to have a better opportunity than me
5929007 she stood behind young people who dared to make a difference
5929008 what makes this especially painful however is that chappel fork is one of the very rare places in pennsylvania where wild trout naturally reproduce
5929009 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5929010 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5929011 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5929012 today in this room theres been yet another attempt to turn things on their head and portray the aggressors as the victim
5929013 theres a clear expression of propaganda in detriment to serious important political work which needs to be done in the security council
5929014 unfortunately the status of affairs in georgia has not changed despite the cease fire agreement reached a few days ago
5929015 georgia is occupied by russian military forces forces which are determined to devastate my country
5929016 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5929017 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5929018 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5929019 obviously we are very sensitive to the disaster that happened and the need for absolute transparency
5929020 every entry judged will have individual judges comments and we will include on the back of each award who the judge was
5929021 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
5929022 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
5929023 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5929024 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5929025 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust
5929026 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5929027 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5929028 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5929029 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5929030 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5929031 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5929032 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5929033 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5929034 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5929035 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5929036 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5929037 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5929038 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5929039 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5929040 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5929041 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5929042 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5929043 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5929044 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5929045 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5929046 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5929047 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5929048 there is no direct evidence that momin khawaja had any knowledge of the london fertilizer bomb plot
5929049 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5929050 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5929051 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5929052 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5929053 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5929054 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5929055 i wish god could just tell me what to do

5929057 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5929058 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5929059 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5929060 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5929061 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programmes will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5929062 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5929063 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy

5929072 the abuse that happens when people in power high rank holders use their rank to exploit demean or gain unfair advantage over those of lower rank
5929073 dignity for all how to create a world without rankism
5929074 the olympics are a great festival of human beings seeking rank and thats ok
5929075 we all seek high rank and we rather enjoy watching other people seek gold medals and we applaud the victor and feel sorry for the loser
5929076 were assuming these people arent cheating and if any of them are thats rankism thats the abuse of the process through which rank is earned legitimately
5929077 there are other egregious forms of rankism but we dont get to see that on our tv screen a few coaches really abusing their athletes
5929078 it went on in east germany it went on famously in gymnastics where young girls have their futures compromised both nutritionally and otherwise by brutal coaches
5929079 rankism happens when we over celebrate the victory and having lionized the victor then give that victor all sort of special privileges
5929080 its we gullible people who think winner takes all means winner knows everything
5929081 winner doesnt winner knows how to hit the baseball or knows how to swim winner doesnt know which car is better than another car
5929082 when you have a company where everybody feels dignified they work harder they get sick less often they love the boss they go the extra mile and theyre a team
5929083 they know that everybody has equal dignity from the ceo to the janitor and all of them are invited to the christmas party and everybodys contribution is acknowledged and essential
5929084 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5929085 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5929086 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
5929087 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
5929088 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back so there has been no withdrawal whatsoever
5929089 i just remembered my great aunt always had this and she was in leningrad
5929090 even later when she had plenty of money and food she always had this now we have to think about these things again
5929091 when they come together there is bound to be disagreement on how to resolve certain issues and how to address certain problems
5929092 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5929093 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5929094 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5929095 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5929096 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

5929121 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and to pick up good points
5929122 so much as i want to win in valencia i know the most important thing is to score well because the big picture is the championship and not just one race
5929123 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
5929124 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
5929125 it looks pretty fast to be honest you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
5929126 its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
5929127 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later

5929134 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5929135 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5929136 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5929137 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5929138 at the start of games youll see teams come out with a lot of energy then as the game goes on we keep it turned on and we wind up wearing people down
5929139 were not afraid to get on someone if someones not playing defense
5929140 when you look at all the other teams that have been together for so long they can talk to each other the jerry colangelo play eliminated the second guessing of when to get on each other that only makes us better

5929159 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel

5929161 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5929162 in each case the children fell through the access cover of the rainwater tank and drowned within minutes
5929163 young children are insatiably curious and enjoy exploring their environment
5929164 their lack of appreciation of any danger compounded by their inability to swim and their failure to call out for help can be a recipe for disaster
5929165 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5929166 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5929167 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5929168 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5929169 maintenance practices for the clearing of vegetation at the murrow farm level crossing were inadequate to maintain effective sighting of trains
5929170 programmed works that had identified the vegetation as a sighting hazard which was to be rectified within 28 days had not been carried out in accordance with the relevant maintenance specification
5929171 you had borrowed 6000 to fund your drug habit and the lenders had made threats to kill you if you did not repay the debt
5929172 i accept that you did not actually have a firearm but the bank employees were not to know that
5929173 as you age and your communication skills develop the chances are that you will fall into the largest group of humans on this planet nice people with less than perfect communication skills

5929176 es kann nicht sein dass die arbeit eines angestellten weniger wert ist als die arbeit eines beamten
5929177 sowohl angestellte als auch beamte m ssen ins rentensystem einzahlen
5929178 alle elemente der rentenreform m ssen wirkungsgleich auf die beamten bertragen werden

5929183 i still do a lot of underground records but people dont seem to pay attention to a lot of these things like they would a 50 or g unit record
5929184 whats kind of weird about it is that 50 can do it and people will with it but for some reason people only with his version of it
5929185 wer sich einb rgert wird mehr an der gesellschaft beteiligt
5929186 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5929187 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5929188 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5929189 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5929190 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5929191 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5929192 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5929193 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5929194 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5929195 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5929196 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5929197 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5929198 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5929199 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5929200 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5929201 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5929202 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5929203 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5929204 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5929205 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5929206 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5929207 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5929208 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5929209 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5929210 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5929211 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5929212 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5929213 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5929214 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5929215 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5929216 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5929217 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5929218 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5929219 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5929220 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5929221 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5929222 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5929223 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5929224 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organizations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
5929225 on august 9 or 10 massive bombing started and the village administration building and a hospital building were destroyed bombing took place day and night it looked like they were targeting big buildings that could be housing the georgian military
5929226 during the bombing on august 9 my uncles neighbor was killed my uncle buried him in his backyard
5929227 we had to walk through the woods to gori district villages and then our military helped us to evacuate when we were walking through the woods the bombing continued i had to lie in swamps and crawl for hours i was afraid to get up
5929228 there were five people in our car suddenly there was an explosion perhaps four or five cars were hit i saw that people were injured and killed there was blood
5929229 there were many wounded i had to decide who had better chances of survival and stuff them into the ambulance we buried the dead in the yards and fled the village
5929230 any comprehensive investigation takes time but we continue to gather information that points to indiscriminate attacks by georgias forces
5929231 during the shelling a grad rocket hit the house setting the roof on fire my father went outside to try to put out the flames and at that moment another rocket hit he was wounded in his thigh by a piece of shrapnel our mother dragged him to the basement and spent several hours trying to stop the bleeding but she had nothing to bandage the wound with he slowly bled to death in her arms
5929232 we all rushed to the basement but an elderly man some 80 years old who lived on the fourth floor didnt manage to make it to the basement in time his apartment was hit by a shell and caught fire when the attack was over we went upstairs and saw that the old man burned to ashes we buried his remains in the yard
5929233 have you been here the whole time during the shelling and everything we thought the civilians had all fled
5929234 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
5929235 unfortunately or fortunately i havent had rat yet but my mother has and she says it is very nice
5929236 there is in every madman a misunderstood genius whose idea shining in his head frightened people and for whom delirium was the only solution to the strangulation that life had prepared for him
5929237 i have cultivated my hysteria with delight and terror i have received a singular warning i have felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me
5929238 to be buried in lava and not turn a hair it is then a man shows what he is made of to know he can do better next time unrecognizably better and that there is no next time and that it is a blessing there is not there is a thought to be going on with
5929239 the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom
5929240 he awoke opened his eyes the room meant very little to him he was deeply immersed in the non being from which he had just come there was the certitude of an infinite sadness at the core of his consciousness but the sadness was reassuring because alone it was familiar
5929241 there was nothing really as glorious as a good beer shit i mean after drinking twenty or twenty five beers the night before the odor of a beer shit like that spread all around and stayed for a good hour and a half it made you realize that you were really alive
5929242 ever see a hot shot hit kid i saw the gimp catch one in philly we rigged his room with a one way whorehouse mirror and charged a sawski to watch it he never got the needle out of his arm they dont if the shot is right thats the way they find them dropper full of clotted blood hanging out of a blue arm the look in his eyes when it hit kid it was tasty
5929243 i shall tell you a great secret my friend do not wait for the last judgment it takes place every day
5929244 true we have got into the habit of admiring colossal bandits whose opulence is revered by the entire world yet whose existence once we stop to examine it proves to be one long crime repeated ad infinitum but those same bandits are heaped with glory honors and power their crimes are hallowed by the law of the land whereas as far back in history as the eye can see and history as you know is my business everything conspires to show that a venial theft especially of inglorious foodstuffs such as bread crusts ham or cheese unfailingly subjects its perpetrator to irreparable opprobium the automatic dishonor and inexpiable shame and this for two reasons first because the perpetrator of such an offense is usually poor which in itself connotes basic unworthiness and secondly because his act implies as it were a tacit reproach to the community
5929245 hell came right along with god hand in hand the stink of sulfur swirled in the air of the church fire burned in the aisles and brimstone rained out of the rafters from the evangelists oven mouth spewed images of a place with pitchforks and devils and lakes of fire that burned forever god had fixed a place like that because he loved us so much
5929246 opium gives and takes away it defeats the steady habit of exertion but it creates spasms of irregular exertion it ruins the natural power of life but it develops preternatural paroxysms of intermitting power
5929247 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
5929248 its a burden to us even to be human beings men with our own real body and blood we are ashamed of it we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalized man
5929249 i fought because i understood and could not bear to understand that is was my destiny unlike that of my father whose fate it was to hear the roar of the crowd to sit in the stands with most men and acclaim others it was my fate my destiny my end to be a fan
5929250 how helpless they all looked in the ugliness of sleep a third of life spent unconscious and corpselike and some the great majority stumbled through their waking hours scarcely more awake helpless in the face of destiny they stumbled down a dark alley toward their deaths they sent exploring feelers into the light and met fire and writhed back again into the darkness of their blind groping
5929251 it is because the public are a mass inert obtuse and passive that they need to be shaken up from time to time so that we can tell from their bear like grunts where they are and also where they stand they are pretty harmless in spite of their numbers because they are fighting against intelligence
5929252 the other day i wrote down the following wish when passing a house to be pulled in through the ground floor window by a rope tied around ones neck and to be hauled up bloody and ragged through all the ceilings furniture walls and attics without consideration as if by a person who is paying no attention until the empty noose dropping the last shreds of me when breaking through the roof tiles appears on the roof
5929253 i shambled after as ive been doing all my life after people who interest me because the only people for me are the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved desirous of everything at the same time the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes awww
5929254 i been silent so long now its gonna roar out of me like floodwaters and you think the guy tellng this is ranting and raving my god you think this is too horrible to have really happened this is too awful to be the truth but please its still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it but its the truth even if it didnt happen
5929255 where are the children i might have wanted you may suppose i might have wanted them drowned to the accompaniment of the rattling of a thousand douche bags
5929256 what if at the last moment when the banquet table is set and the cymbals clash there should appear suddenly and wholly without warning a silver platter on which even the blind could see that there is nothing more and nothing less than two enormous lumps of shit that i believe would be more miraculous than anything which man has looked forward to it would be miraculous because it would be undreamed of it would be more miraculous than even the wildest dream because anybody could imagine the possibility but nobody ever has and probably nobody ever again will
5929257 he sits at the filthy bar amidst the leather vested fat guys the worn and weary pool tables the smelly sluts who are much harder and drunker than hell ever be the puke piss spit blood encrusted carpeting the brain damaged human carcasses who have held their heads below their shoulders for longer than hes been alive the slimy sidewalk penny loafers who wanna be his pal and the rest of the supporting cast with heads vacuous and pant seats full he sits as the last remnants of today and all that came before it slip into the void of blackout
5929258 tyler says im nowhere near hitting the bottom yet and if i dont fall all the way i cant be saved jesus did it with his crucifixion thing i shouldnt just abandon money and property and knowledge this isnt just a weekend retreat i should run from self improvement and i should be running toward disaster i cant just play it safe anymore
5929259 to speak of certain government and establishment institutions as the system is to speak correctly since these organizations are founded upon the same structural relationships as a motorcycle they are sustained by structural relationships even when they have lost all their meaning and purpose people arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to five without question because the structure demands that it be that way theres no villain no mean guy who wants them to live meaningless lives its just that the structure the system demands it and no one is willing to take on the formidable task of changing the structure just because it is meaningless
5929260 the poet makes himself a seer by a long prodigious and rational disordering of all the senses every form of love of suffering of madness he searches himself he consumes all the poisons in him and keeps only their quintessences
5929261 but men labor under a mistake the better part of the man is soon ploughed into the soil for compost by a seeming fate commonly called necessity they are employed as it says in an old book laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal it is a fools life as they will find when they get to the end of it if not before
5929262 we had two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a saltshaker half full of cocaine and a whole multicolored collection of uppers downers laughers screamers also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of beer a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the ether there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon
5929263 i wrote the air force back then asking for details about the raid on dresden who ordered it how many planes did it what desirable results they had been and so on
5929264 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5929265 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5929266 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5929267 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5929268 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5929269 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
5929270 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved

5929279 what is a boy toy the only definition that matters to me is my own a boy toy is something that exists for my sexual amusement perhaps hes a hot sex slave i use and discard as i please or a nameless object that performs for my pleasure and that of my friends in any case hes under my complete domination existing only to entertain cock control
5929280 do you like the thought of being the boy toy of a beautiful woman like me well stop dreaming its time to play
5929281 i never grow tired of playing with my toys but i do have favorites special pets that i choose more often than the others depth of submission is a clear factor in this decision as is the obvious when considering any boy toy size of cock but what i like most is how addicted they are to me cock tease

5929289 paper television was recorded in the northwestern usa between winter 2005 amp spring 2006 in response to these dark times nationally and internationally we spent a good part of our time making a pop record
5929290 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5929291 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5929292 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5929293 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5929294 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5929295 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5929296 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5929297 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5929298 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5929299 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5929300 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5929301 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5929327 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5929328 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5929329 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained

5929340 there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry to complement the clean energy future
5929341 but it is not likely to be developed until we have the major political parties supportive of it
5929342 we remain open to having discussions with the government if it chooses to change its position on nuclear power but until such time as it does i dont see that its likely to happen
5929343 we cannot envisage any circumstances under which australia will have a nuclear power industry
5929344 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5929345 if i was just going to become a transformers girl
5929346 transformers was important and defining for me because it taught me about what kinds of movies i want to make and the kind of actor i want to be and i have a long way to go before i become that actor
5929347 se um dia o futebol brasileiro me quiser de volta a esta casa que quero voltar sei que os que aqui ficaram t m todas as condi es de fazer o palmeiras campe o e do outro lado do mundo estarei torcendo pelo time pelos meus companheiros pela comiss o t cnica dirigentes e principalmente por voc torcedor palmeirense
5929348 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5929349 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5929350 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5929351 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5929352 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5929353 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5929354 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5929355 why is there a guy with no shirt on my tv
5929356 and why is he ironing something with a pink iron
5929357 thats a kids dress for a little girl like a child
5929358 what the hell does a p whipped guy ironing little girl clothes have to do with a car
5929359 by the unholy alliance of mayo and pickles what schmuck in marketing at chevy thought it was a good idea to greenlight this commercial how exactly does making chevy the official pedophiles automobile of choice make any kind of sense
5929360 and omg now hes on his knees cleaning the toilet
5929361 i think im going to need to douse my eyes with bleach to remove this from my head
5929362 chevy you are sick sick people seek professional help before someone gets hurt please
5929363 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5929364 huge huge he cant feel his legs hes got a bad heart hes been in and out of hospital with a heart attack just two weeks ago he has to carry his spray in his pocket just to spray under his tongue
5929365 so this could kill him to be dragged away from his family and friends and his home
5929366 this is home he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5929367 so badly that he died from his injuries late that evening
5929368 but you can say baby baby can i hold you tonight maybe if i told you the right words at the right time youd be mine
5929369 you either would have dedicated seats or essentially a replica of your work center at that data center shared or dedicated
5929370 by using a lot of these virtualization techniques when you want to move your workspace from your office we would be able to transparently move your applications and desktop so youd be up and running
5929371 back when ibm was at its peak it leased mainframes and was virtually recession proof cloud computing in its absolute sense isnt computers you purchase for your own cloud but services you subscribe to for your organization which can be increased or decreased based on need
5929372 siempre supo que las relaciones sexuales entre personas del mismo sexo no era lo que dios pretend a para nosotros
5929373 sure mr logan theres your regular solo title of course plus the usual line up of team books

5929375 theres also your side projects origins first class manifest destiny another first class
5929376 dont forget cameos possibly avengers invaders maybe a secret invasion appearance
5929377 hmph sounds like a light month to me think i got room for one more book you got anythin fun
5929378 if oil prices fall further the dollar may regain its force
5929379 the yen may advance to the mid 109 per dollar level on technical factors
5929380 credit concerns in the us financial sector are still stalking investors here
5929381 even if investors buy the dollar temporarily they do so only because other major currencies are not attractive
5929382 the japanese economy is also slowing down but the yen may regain its force compared with the dollar
5929383 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5929384 1908 on the parapet of the times tower lighting up to signal the arrival of the new year one can only imagine how chaotic the celebration must have been based on the report given by the times
5929385 how trustworthy do you find the advertising on these sites
5929386 whether it was making a purchase or going to the web site or visiting the advertisers store we found that visitors were more likely to take action after viewing these ads on local media sites
5929387 for the advertiser this provides some concrete understanding regarding how best to spend their dollars in terms of trying to connect with local consumers
5929388 we also found that the local media sites were attracting consumers who were actually spending more money online overall
5929389 were starting to use search to justify traditional media budgets
5929390 two years ago no one was thinking about search that early in the process
5929391 two thirds of the people polled after exposed to some form of offline messaging were driven to perform a search then 39 percent of those people made a purchase
5929392 its not going to be the be all or end all of branded search but go to google and its not as compelling
5929393 we dont want an hispanic cannes lion we dont want an hispanic clio we want a clio
5929394 we get it off their balance sheet and we take on the management duties
5929395 oh but our gift opening was just lovely and everyone was thrilled to be there
5929396 oh we had mimosas and laughed it was just casual and fun
5929397 its not a very good neighborhood for crime and stuff like that
5929398 these are not nice guys the public doesnt want them hanging around our vulnerable populations
5929399 were in very close communication between nevada department of public safety metro and our police department
5929400 its really well lit and i never felt worried and if you do you can always contact police to escort you
5929401 any allegation of wrongdoing is nothing more than garbage being shoveled by the city attorneys political opponents hiding behind the cloak of anonymity
5929402 a strong man doesnt need to read the future he makes his own
5929403 i dont know where she is i never leave this place your people asked our families to leave the towns and you destroyed our homes we went into the mines you set off your bombs and turned everything to ashes you made us what weve become
5929404 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5929405 but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
5929406 ive pitched plenty of winnable games and pitched plenty of losable games during that stretch
5929407 the first half i came away with a lot of victories pitching the same way that i have this half
5929408 sometimes i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can make the difference right now
5929409 thats the reality of the situation i know theres not a lot of room for error
5929410 in our area hantavirus is at a fairly low level but people need to know that it does exist in our community
5929411 they need to assume its out there and take precautions
5929412 the most important thing to remember is that this is not spread by person to person contact and it is very rare
5929413 it is really a difficult time for everyone in georgia
5929414 i talk to my friends who are covering the conflict and they say it is impossible to work in this situation
5929415 we are just hoping to receive some response from the international community and hopefully that will make a difference in the future
5929416 he said he stood by us and he wished us well
5929417 but closing the gap is difficult for obama or mccain to claim as a top priority because it means directly challenging the top 20 percent to give back to their country
5929418 muslims hindus buddhists and people of other non christian non jewish faiths
5929419 sure to be asking themselves just what is mccain trying to tell us
5929420 the next generation of protection is already in the works
5929421 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5929422 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5929423 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
5929424 nothing more than a code word for the typical income redistribution those on the left have sought since the days of karl marx
5929425 a communist party flag that he and a roommate brought back from russia
5929426 born to jewish parents on new york citys lower east side in 1955
5929427 roots in the leftist political environment of the 1940s one dominated by literary intellectuals who were comfortable with self proclaimed communists in their midst
5929428 the habit is a crack in the wall a flaw that calls into question whether the persona axelrod has crafted for obama is who obama really is
5929429 people are going to be looking at the gas numbers
5929430 just as the market overshot to the upside it overshot the other way
5929431 i think credit markets need to improve in the u s before we see a sustained rally in the dollar
5929432 we may have hit a top for the dollar i dont think this rally can last
5929433 spent a significant amount of time in her apartment before he left
5929434 911 will respond and the 911 dispatchers will know that there are no such jurisdictional issues
5929435 so the warning now to those groups is if youre going to tie up those chains around the building or if youre going to try to damage the palace youre going to get arrested
5929436 to verify that the advertisers were not selling competing products
5929437 brief business relationship with google caused her irreparable harm by damaging her reputation and the reputation of her products and services
5929438 marijuana smoking can continue at the shops for as long as no tobacco is in the mix
5929439 marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science it is not medicine and it is not safe and legalization of marijuana no matter how it begins will come at the expense of our children and public safety
5929440 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
5929441 in searching for an individual to fill this important position we conducted a national search for someone with an excellent outstanding record of educational leadership and a passion for promoting indigenous knowledge
5929442 to bring together the otology of indigenous knowing allows us to make a more significant impact on the education of our children today and seven generations to come
5929443 not only as a place for all indigenous people to gather to learn but also a place for the community to engage to learn to thrive
5929444 but i would say this that there are hundreds of hawaiians today who have the genealogical right to lead a nation and then there are thousands of hawaiians of hawaiians today who have the intellectual right to lead a nation and when we vote on who that person will be thats wholl sit on the throne
5929445 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5929446 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5929447 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5929448 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5929449 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5929450 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5929451 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5929452 de chicago es de agradecer porque adem s de compartir las 7 horas que estuvimos all lo organiz lo pag y nos llev en coche una hora de autopista para ir y otra para volver
5929453 a new census report says that whites in the us will be a minority by the year 2042
5929454 the complexion of america is changing and a lot faster than you think in just 34 years the census bureau says whites will no longer be a majority in this country
5929455 projections of the population by race and hispanic origin for the united states 2008 to 2050
5929456 why should pennsylvania founded by the english become a colony of aliens
5929457 who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our anglifying them
5929458 will never adopt our language or customs any more than they can adopt our complexion
5929459 races with which the english speaking people have never hitherto assimilated and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the united states
5929460 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5929461 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5929462 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5929463 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5929464 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5929465 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5929466 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5929467 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5929468 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5929469 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5929470 its a thunderclap both for pakistan and its foreign supporters
5929471 the one thing the two had in common was their opposition to musharraf
5929472 a lot of pakistanis feel he is not fit to be president or prime minister of pakistan until these allegations are finally cleared up
5929473 now that hes gone they will be accountable to whats happening
5929474 theres going to be a lot of change now in pakistans policies both internally and towards afghanistan
5929475 a fight against pashtun tribesmen along the north west frontier of pakistan who are supportive of their pashtun first cousins in afghanistan
5929476 it think with all of its other troubles islamist militants in the tribal areas secessionists in baluchistan the last thing the government would want to do is stir the pot in kashmir
5929477 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5929478 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5929479 the closer a team size moves to one the more efficient its productivity
5929480 explaining to one person every detail of the plan is tedious enough imagine having to do the same for multiple people
5929481 when there is one person both running and operating the entire show you have 0 communication efficiency loss
5929482 thats not really what i think it is is it
5929483 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5929484 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as

5929487 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5929488 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5929489 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5929490 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5929491 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5929492 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5929493 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5929494 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5929495 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5929496 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5929497 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5929498 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5929499 being an idealist and i always have been pretty naive i trust everyone i just didnt know it was possible to be a victim of this sort of thing
5929500 it is also the consumers responsibility to treat every financial transaction with care to protect themselves and their hard earned money
5929501 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5929502 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5929503 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5929504 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5929505 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5929506 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5929507 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5929508 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5929509 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5929510 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5929511 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5929512 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5929513 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5929514 el greco to vel zquez art during the reign of philip iii
5929515 if you went to europe it would take you months or years to track down these works of art
5929516 even then you would not get the story behind the exhibition
5929517 the nasher museum is proud to announce an old master exhibition that is one of the most important ever shown in the southeast united states
5929518 this internationally significant exhibition provides an unprecedented opportunity to set the record straight on a fascinating chapter of european art history

5929520 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5929521 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5929522 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5929523 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5929524 we always learn about the food pyramid in school but its boring so we dont remember it
5929525 obesity is a silent disease because nobody wants to talk about it
5929526 medicine has needed designers for a long time to help deliver the information that we already know is important that is the biggest dilemma
5929527 this game is all encompassing and helps us deliver the information
5929528 it teaches you how to be healthy without it being really confusing it is important to know what the right balance is for everyone
5929529 every kid who gets the talk will also get the game that the whole family can play together its a holistic way to talk about getting healthy
5929530 in the future we would like to get the support of insurance companies so that physicians can get trained to teach simple nutrition to kids
5929531 what is batman doing when he is not fighting some crime

5929534 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5929535 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5929536 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5929537 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5929538 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5929539 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5929540 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5929541 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5929542 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5929543 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5929544 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5929545 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5929546 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5929547 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5929548 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5929549 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5929550 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5929551 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua

5929553 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5929554 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5929555 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5929556 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5929557 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5929558 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5929559 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5929560 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5929561 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5929562 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5929563 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5929564 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5929565 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5929566 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5929567 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5929572 thats over 2 million in fuel surcharges for 1 voyage
5929573 we know that no vessel is burning 2 million in fuel on a single voyage between hawaii and the mainland
5929574 we are starting to see a downward trend but you have to recognize that there were still enormous spikes this year
5929575 while the current trend is encouraging we have to wait to see if this really holds
5929576 and the real frustration as ive talked to so many different consumers and shippers in hawaii is they feel theres nothing they can do about it
5929577 when you mask this profit making machine as a fuel surcharge its easier for the consumer to swallow
5929578 youre in a position to do something do something about this
5929579 allow this to be a wake up call for hawaii and the rest of the country
5929580 whenever there is a high profile case we take a breath and wonder was it somebody that we missed was it somebody we missed in the system that fell through the cracks
5929581 we need a mechanisism to track the system as a whole and make sure its consistent and everyone has access to the services they need
5929582 now theres concerns that kids are falling through the cracks and not getting the help they need when they need it
5929583 just like cancer kidney disease and diabetes they need to be acknowledged and need to be treated
5929584 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live

5929604 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5929605 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5929610 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5929611 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5929612 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5929613 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5929614 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5929615 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5929616 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5929617 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5929618 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5929619 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5929620 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5929621 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5929622 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5929623 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5929624 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5929627 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5929630 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5929631 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5929632 they both want to lower expectations but theyre both out there doing as much as they can to look good in the primary
5929633 i think once you start moving down the ballot its going to be very interesting to see what happens
5929634 its become more important with the top two if you want your candidate in the general you cant assume they will be there
5929635 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5929636 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5929637 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5929638 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5929639 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
5929640 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things
5929641 if the perception prevails out there then people are going to miss an opportunity to get a good value
5929642 we created plenty of chances so nobody is pressing the panic button here
5929643 caused the error got a packet bigger than max allowed packet bytes
5929644 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5929645 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5929646 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5929647 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5929648 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5929649 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5929650 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5929651 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5929652 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5929653 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5929654 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5929655 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5929656 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5929657 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5929658 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5929659 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5929660 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5929661 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5929662 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5929663 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5929664 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5929665 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5929666 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5929667 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5929668 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5929669 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5929670 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5929671 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5929672 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5929673 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5929674 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5929675 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5929676 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5929677 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5929678 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5929679 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5929680 this is a planning took where all things are going
5929681 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5929682 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5929683 thats not really what i think it is is it
5929684 piddler on the roof because of the second floor location of the napier city council parking meter
5929685 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
5929686 i couldnt stand properly i wasnt aware of what i was doing he said
5929687 i dont want to be known forever as the piddler on the roof he said
5929688 id like to say im sorry but who hasnt p ed in public
5929689 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5929690 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5929691 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5929692 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5929693 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5929694 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5929695 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5929696 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5929697 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5929698 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5929699 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5929700 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5929701 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5929702 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5929703 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5929704 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5929705 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5929706 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5929707 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5929708 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5929709 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5929710 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5929711 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5929712 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5929713 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5929714 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5929715 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5929716 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5929717 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5929718 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5929719 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5929720 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5929721 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5929722 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5929723 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5929724 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5929725 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5929726 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5929727 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5929728 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5929729 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5929730 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5929731 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5929732 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5929733 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5929734 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5929735 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5929736 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5929737 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5929738 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5929739 chris jericho is the single greatest thing on any wrestling show right now
5929740 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5929741 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
5929742 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5929743 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5929744 if i was in a position to retire i would be doing it right now
5929745 i would be doing a press conference and getting everyone along for my last melbourne game but i am long from retired i reckon i have got another two years left in me
5929746 the body is still good the mind is still good i am still motivated to play and i want to give myself every opportunity to play next year
5929747 the youth policy probably also means that for me to play on next year it will probably have to be somewhere else i have absolutely no animosity towards the club for that
5929748 convinced the generals that they were prepared to supplement the brutality which the military possessed with the intellectual assets it lacked
5929749 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

5929767 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
5929768 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
5929769 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
5929770 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5929771 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5929772 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5929773 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5929774 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5929775 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5929776 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5929777 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5929778 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5929779 according to shariah theyre adults so they should be with the adults
5929780 james has always been dedicated to providing tools for free speech
5929781 im trying not to think about it because it makes me nervous but im also really confident
5929782 considering how badly the chinese leadership doesnt want tibet to be talked about i think it would be considered a success
5929783 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5929784 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5929785 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
5929786 we promised kashmiris a plebiscite six decades ago let us hold one now and give them three choices independence union with pakistan and union with india almost certainly the valley will opt for independence jammu will opt to stay with india and probably ladakh too let kashmiris decide the outcome not the politicians and armies of india and pakistan
5929787 if you are economically strong you can fight for your independence if you are weak then you have nothing
5929788 we are kashmiris not indians earlier my mother used to tell me not to join protests but yesterday even my mother was in the protest with me
5929789 the u n the u s britain and international community to come and see what people want here
5929790 the u n should send its peacekeepers to jammu as well as kashmir
5929791 people have given their verdict that they wont tolerate oppression and injustice it is time for new delhi to act and solve the dispute
5929792 now people are saying that anytime fundamentalists in india or in other regions of jammu can cause an economic blockade in kashmir people are demanding that they have a birth right to trade with other side of kashmir why cant we look for alternative market if we can have
5929793 when i am in india i am treated as a kashmiri and not as an indian
5929794 if i am told that i am kashmiri then i am kashmiri
5929795 there is no government nothing only people on the roads thats all
5929796 it was just all so fine from the indian point of view you had the kashmiri separatists almost isolated
5929797 everything was moving so beautifully and then these guys start playing electoral politics it was one of the best times after the militancy but now it has gone back to the 90s phase
5929798 i think the chief minister was hoping the issue would get him some votes in the jammu region and they didnt bargain on the kind of response that they got
5929799 now on both sides in jammu and kashmir it has gotten far beyond the land issue
5929800 if you are economically strong you can fight for your independence if you are weak then you have nothing
5929801 how fortunate for governments that the people they administer dont think

5929833 the uk supports the high commissioners calls for a human rights country office in sri lanka and urges the sri lankans to work constructively with her office to achieve this goal
5929834 we need to be clear about values for example the declaration at the world summit in 2005 that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide ethnic cleansing war crimes and crimes against humanity
5929835 the human rights council at the united nations has now banned any criticism regarding sharia law and human rights in the islamic world according to president doru romulus costea and following the efforts of delegates from egypt pakistan and iran the council will no longer tolerate criticism of either sharia or specific fatwas in the name of human rights

5929839 the series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the muslim world

5929841 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5929842 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5929843 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5929844 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5929845 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5929846 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5929847 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5929848 honestly i expect more people will hear this than the tv debate

5929863 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5929864 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought

5929892 they are also key conspirators who designed and planned the terror attacks in ahmedabad they may also be involved in jaipur and hyderabad blasts

5929900 this day should be celebrated by renewing ones commitment for the fight against the bite every citizen should be aware that water should not be allowed to stand for seven consecutive days and should be emptied out places like fountains ponds or open plots that cannot be emptied out need to be treated with anti larvicides
5929901 cases of malaria are being reported in a sizeable number in vejalpur
5929902 these days we are witnessing a completely different kind of mosquitoes here there is burning sensation in the body and the bite leaves a hole on the skin
5929903 are you gonna set an agenda of change or one of compromise of what the republican minority is gonna allow you to do in the congress
5929904 e ven if we do well theres still gonna be almost half the country that votes for somebody else so one of the things that we have to understand is that theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are and my core principles are that im fighting for ordinary americans to make sure that they can live out their american dream and i am fighting to make sure that our values and ideals enshrined in our constitution and our declaration of independence are upheld
5929905 winning elections and governing in america is a complex undertaking and it takes some recognition that most of the country is more moderate
5929906 more people identify themselves as moderates than either liberal or conservative i think hes a moderate but a liberal moderate and hes not running as an ideologue which i think is important i do think though he has to sharpen his message so that those moderates are comfortable with his values
5929907 hes changed the emphasis in which he talks about things hes in for a hard fight and there are large swatches of the country that are waiting to see if hes pretty close to them in terms of values this hasnt been easy for democrats to do theres a reason democrats have lost seven out of the last 10 elections for president withobama youve seen an emphasis on things like faith based initiatives which have always been part of his platform but wasnt a major emphasis in the primary campaign
5929908 theres always been this tension about whether you run a populist campaign geared towards middle class voters their needs their angers
5929909 or do you run a moderate dlc democratic leadership council model the truth is weve come out of this hybrid of the two
5929910 he has to show people who dont live in seattle or new york city that hes real
5929911 campaigns arent about issues theyre about emotions raw emotions and he has to spend a lot of time speaking to people in the middle of america he has to broaden his voice
5929912 i remind a lot of democrats who didnt vote for al gore because he wasnt liberal enough that we got george bush
5929913 how did that help the liberal cause al gore would not have gotten us into iraq and he wouldnt have appointed supreme court justices like johnalito and john roberts i am not one of those who sits back and says youre either 100 percent with us or youre against us it doesnt make sense obama might be something you might not like to win in pennsylvania or somewhere else governing is more important than purity youve got to keep your ideals but you have to be a realist
5929914 you ran great guns in the campaign it was an insurgency boy a sight to see and then you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath just the middle of the road nothing but a long line painted yellow i wanted to retire five years ago but i waited for a democrat i wanted a democrat hmmph and instead i got you
5929915 if you look at where the american people are were where the american people are on issue after issue after issue
5929916 whether its getting responsibly out of iraq or forming an energy independence plan i think sen obamas where the american public is
5929917 democrats are two three times more energized about their nominee than republicans are about theirs the great thing is that the base wants change and independents in this country want change as a matter of fact moderate republicans want change i think were fortunate that we have a message that carries across all of those platforms
5929918 where the purple gemstone amethyst was widely believed to ward off drunkenness if used in drinking vessels and jewelry
5929919 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken

5929921 weve kept up our patrols but we havent found any kids in or around them
5929922 weve reinterviewed staff in the area and theyre now saying they believe the kids were playing in the bins and not actually residing in them
5929923 were following a number of leads to try to identify the family these kids belong to just to make sure there are no issues and so that we can confirm the kids were just playing
5929924 but certainly a closer examination of the bedding would suggest it is not children that are actually using this bin to sleep in if that is in fact what it is being used for
5929925 over the last five years weve managed to migrate about 1000 users across to digital every month
5929926 we started out by offering customers a great deal if they came across to digital we gave them fair warning that the warriors were moving channels when we did that 10 000 people migrated were they all warriors fans i dont know and i dont care but we got them across
5929927 we have a bunch of uhf transmitters out there on borrowed time theyre falling to bits they generally have a life of 15 years you just cant buy analogue uhf transmitters anymore and no one makes the parts for them anymore
5929928 we may have to start going to the remaining segments of the market and offer them more special deals to come to digital uhf is either going to be turned off or fall apart
5929929 we have a strong desire to assist in setting the agenda and doing what is best for new zealand not least from a competition perspective
5929930 port of tauranga has always held the view that a full merger of port of tauranga and ports of auckland makes very good sense that view has not changed
5929931 port of taurangas result for the financial year ending 30 june 2008 will not be announced until thursday 28 august but port of taurangas 2007 net profit after tax of 38 million makes an interesting comparison with ports of aucklands profit announcement today of 21 1 million
5929932 a rough and ready calculation would suggest that port of taurangas container business would be worth substantially more than ports of aucklands container business

5929938 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5929939 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5929940 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5929941 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5929942 all im doing and all ive done for the last 30 years is find things that are taken too seriously and expose them in a comedic fashion
5929943 who wouldve thought airplane disaster movies would be material for jokes before airplane or serious westerns would be funny until blazing saddles
5929944 my motivations have always been to first ask where can i find good jokes
5929945 even though we are dealing with some serious subjects we repeatedly remind the audience you are watching a comedy

5929951 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
5929952 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
5929953 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
5929954 bagi saya menjadi kapten adalah hal yang penting tapi ada yang lebih penting yakni sebuah momen yang membuat pemain dipanggil masuk ke dalam tim dia terry belum tentu akan terus bermain
5929955 sebelas pemain yang menjadi starter merupakan yang terbaik dari pilihan saya bukan karena jabatan kapten di sini kami juga memiliki wakil kapten rio ferdinand
5929956 dalam beberapa kesempatan pada karir saya saya suka berdiskusi dengan kapten tim tapi biasanya semua keputusan berada di tangan saya
5929957 saya lebih suka sayalah yang menentukan semuanya saya selalu berbicara dengan staf dan menanyakan pertanyaan yang berbeda beda namun keputusan terakhir adalah milik saya

5929959 despite the demand side taking a beating with high fuel costs mortgage interest rates and food prices peoples confidence in their personal situation remains high they generally see trouble as happening to other people not to them
5929960 even though people are personally adapting to the current situation they seem to see the worst of the effects as happening to somebody else
5929961 while employment remains high and personal circumstances remain relatively comfortable these sentiments will remain intact
5929962 what we might call the supply side of the household economy is ok right now give or take a few investment companies

5929967 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5929968 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5929969 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5929970 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5929986 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5929987 i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball but defensively we gave some chances away we have to improve in that area but that is what these games are for
5929988 overall im very pleased with the performance they looked fresh sharp
5929989 its always a good feeling to put one in the back of the net especially for australia
5929990 i thought we played well in the first half in the second half we made a few subs and didnt play as well as we could have but overall it was a good result
5929991 i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball but defensively we gave some chances away we have to improve in that area but that is what these games are for
5929992 ive been thinking about it and i dont think it will help the nbl that much
5929993 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5929994 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5929995 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level
5929996 i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competition is there
5929997 but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order
5929998 its a very important time for our game in our country its taken some shots and a win wakes the whole country up
5929999 its like the socceroos in the world cup or the when wallabies play the all blacks
