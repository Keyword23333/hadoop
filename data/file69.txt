690001 es gibt viele scharlatane aber die christen sind diejenigen mit den meisten angeblichen heilerfolgen glaubst du dass die gleiche heilkunst zugleich aus den b chern und vom gott der christen kommen kann warum k nnen menschen heilen die nicht christen sind wodurch zeichnen sich dann christen aus dadurch dass sie getaufts ind oder dadurch dass sie heilen sie sind klug genug die heilung nicht zu versprechen daf r aber die erl sung im tod und das ewige leben von den unz hligen glaubensformen die mir bekannt sind wagt keine einzige so dreist so viel zu versprechen
690002 these two dumps are the same dump the first pic was taken on dec 7th i then walked by the same dump on dec 8th and as expected some poor bastard found it with their foot but we benefit these pics come from the dog shit filled south boston ma east 3rd street to be exact

690004 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
690005 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
690006 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
690007 things are pretty bad and the river is getting deeper faster and wider
690008 the question is can they get to other side before the cash runs out
690009 this is almost like evolution and the survival of the fittest
690010 they are on the right path to make fuel efficient cars but its going to take time
690011 i do see more of a resolve we need to take these actions and focus on what we can control
690012 this report is groundbreaking because it shows the extent of damage caused by chinese cheating
690013 we hope it will help to focus the debate on trade to where it needs to be right now with respect to china
690014 a dramatic example is the loss of 200 000 scientists and engineers within the manufacturing sector a 10 7 percent drop
690015 though the decline wasnt huge it was very broadly based with only health care and mining showing anything that could be described as strength hours worked per week declined which is a bad sign for future hiring
690016 if we look at the job losses we had during the time people are calling a mild recession which was 2001 we were losing about 180 000 jobs a month at that time so clearly this is a different degree
690017 we dont like to see job losses obviously 51 000 is disappointing
690018 what were seeing is a mild recession interrupted here by a rebate program
690019 once they consumers finish spending these checks well head down again
690020 a sign of how troubled our economy is that some analysts are greeting the seventh straight month of job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate to 5 7 percent as relatively good news
690021 this stimulus should include increases in the federal share of medicaid significantly increase funding for home energy assistance and food stamps and other measures which will provide badly needed stimulus for our economy and help state and local governments and individuals improve the quality of their lives
690022 the fed is stuck on hold trapped between a weak economy on one side and high headline inflation on the other
690023 the problem is that all these companies have no place to go to drill and no place to put their money
690024 the writedowns are the decisive point and show that the crisis lingers but the results if you look at costs and interest income for example are better than expected
690025 peace and security we discovered in south africa do not come through the barrel of a gun i support the boat convoy in its attempt to bring on going humanitarian relief to the people of gaza
690026 we want to break the siege of gaza we want to raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation we want to uphold palestines right to welcome internationals as visitors human rights observers humanitarian aid workers journalists or otherwise

690028 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
690029 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
690030 the commission did not intend for the internet policy statement to serve as rules
690031 commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
690032 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory
690033 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated

690040 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
690041 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
690042 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain if offering
690043 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
690044 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year

690058 the last week and a half has been very eventful recording vocals brass with people from the the broadcasting orchestra and the philharmonic last night we had a choir called grex vocalis in the studio
690059 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
690060 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
690061 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
690062 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
690063 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
690064 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
690065 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
690066 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
690067 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
690068 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
690069 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
690070 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
690071 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break

690077 in virtually all american states with the exception of massachusetts the landlord can legally choose not to participate in section 8 no questions asked

690160 if something goes wrong even for a month it results in increased malnutrition rates for children in many households while maize is one of the staple foods of the area when it is scarce or too costly families turn to another staple kocho made of the trunk of the enset false banana tree and fermented underground for up to a year enset carries most families through the hunger periods but it lacks nutritional value
690161 young children are always the most vulnerable to severe malnutrition in situations of food shortages
690162 it is imperative that additional resources are found to ensure the rapid start up of nutrition interventions and the continuous availability of critically needed food particularly for life saving nutritional support for children
690163 we urgently need more support to get the lifesaving healthcare and nutritional assistance to the people who need it most
690164 indicated it would be very helpful to have a timetable for development of finningley and the wider land issue at sheffield city airport
690165 it was noted that current flights are achieving generally positive load factors and it was hoped they would form the basis of future growth however the general volatility of the sector needed to be regarded as a constant threat
690166 if finningley were to happen and there were better scheduled services from there an honest appraisal would be needed into the viability of sheffield

690222 the lack of notable change in wolf numbers is not surprising given that northern deer populations have remained relatively stable since 1998 and most forested portions of northern minnesota are already occupied by wolves
690223 this survey presents more evidence that the gray wolf continues to be recovered in minnesota and that minnesotas state wolf management program is effectively protecting wolves

690237 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

690245 having said all of this i require more importantly that the courts the state department and the ins determine whether or not the following documents exist today or existed formerly in the records of other countries and the usa and if they no longer do why they dont a a british colonial birth certificate in the kenyan and or uk records in kenya and london with accompanying documentation b all indonesian identity documents indonesian adoption papers and an indonesian passport with all accompanying documentation incidentally at least some of these documents must have existed from 1966 to 1971 this paragraph was revised c a canadian birth certificate with all accompanying documentation d documentation relevant to these papers in the appropriate us consular service offices the state department and the passport office e all documentation in the us indonesia and possibly canada relative to stanley ann dunham and maya kassandra soetoro ng because their records are relevant to and intimately connected with the senator f a public appearance on national tv on oath before the attorney general of the united states of america by senator barack hussein obama jr doing the following i swearing that he has to the best of his knowledge and belief never held any other nationality or citizenship than that of the usa ii that he at the same time take the oath of allegiance to the united states of america as taken by every naturalized citizen if he is solely and has always been solely a us citizen this should not give him any problems whatsoever if he has not been telling the truth and has held other citizenships it would at least satisfy me that he has told the world that he is going to be loyal in the future
690246 original judah phillip benjamin was the most complex case of multiple nationality and allegiance i could think of
690247 barack obama was adopted by lolo soetoro his indonesian step father and as a result of that adoption his original birth certificate was modified to reflect his new name and the name of his new father
690248 your theory and indisputable evidence is laughable and does not hold up to even a precursory glance
690249 i hate to break it to you but where he was born isnt the issue it is legally possible to be born in the usa and never to be a us citizen in your life
690250 obama should be proud to run as the 1st arab american presidential candidate
690251 two experts with combined experience of more than 60 years in document analysis and computer forensics are willing to testify if necessary

690254 i think every fed official would be likely to conclude that inflation pressures would be in danger of rebounding if the economy started to come back
690255 the amount of clean up left to do likely depends on house prices
690256 i think its premature to conclude that the worst is over for the housing market
690257 investors are going to be very wary of any indication of further deterioration in the labor market
690258 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century

690265 barack obama has played the race card he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
690266 i dont look like the president on a dollar bill or a five dollar bill
690267 theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character

690271 being anxious means you have a very vivid mind that can easily make up a worst case scenario
690272 you dont need to believe in hypnosis for it to work
690273 you just have to be willing to go through the process
690274 ja definitiv das gr te problem war nat rlich die 15 startposition da wussten wir dass es im rennen schwierig wird ich bin auf einen stopp gegangen am start konnte ich ein paar autos berholen speziell durch die ersten paar kurven der plan war an den autos vor mir die auf zwei stopps waren dranzubleiben aber mit unserem auto war das leider nicht m glich
690275 bist du berrascht dar ber dass euch der speed gefehlt hat auch dein teamkollege fiel ja von einer an und f r sich starken startposition weit nach hinten
690276 wir wussten dass robert kubica anm d red im qualifying nicht auf einen sehr langen ersten stint ausgerichtet war trotzdem hat er mit dem vierten platz definitiv ein sehr gutes qualifying hingelegt dass es nur f r den achten platz reicht das h tten wir nicht erwartet
690277 der hungaroring ist eine einzigartige strecke war das hier ein streckenspezifisches problem oder habt ihr boden auf mclaren mercedes und ferrari verloren
690278 es ist schwierig das so kurz nach dem rennen zu beurteilen es gibt nicht nur bei uns sondern auch bei anderen teams schwankungen bei toyota hat das pendel heute nach oben ausgeschlagen gratulation an timo glock anm d red
690279 er war fr her dein teamkollege g nnt man ihm das
690280 die rallye hat riesig spa gemacht wir nehmen viel erfahrung und selbstvertrauen mit
690281 die streckenf hrung mit den vielen engen kurven und unz hligen oft dicht aufeinander folgenden sprungkuppen ist wirklich einmalig unser gruppe n swift lief super und so konnten wir die vorgaben gut umsetzen auch wenn uns das kupplungsproblem beim schlussservice am zweiten tag leider noch den klassensieg gekostet hat
690282 florian und andr haben in finnland einen richtig guten job gemacht und diese gro e herausforderung souver n gemeistert das gute ergebnis wird uns zus tzlichen aufschwung und motivation f r unser heimspiel bei der rallye deutschland geben wo wir wieder in unserem swift super 1600 angreifen werden
690283 auch der letzte reifenssatz von hamilton geht zur untersuchung nach japan denn der war noch l nger auf dem auto
690284 es war eher etwas scharfes ein scharfkantiger stein oder so etwas der bohrte sich in die seitenwand am reifen war nichts zu sehen es ist sehr wahrscheinlich dass es einen schnitt in die seitenwand gab
690285 wir konnten die seitenw nde aber nicht genau untersuchen denn er fuhr die halbe runde mit dem platten reifen auf der seitenwand die stark besch digt waren
690286 aber wir konnten kein problem wie 2007 in der t rkei erkennen oder ein kleines problem wie in diesem jahr in der t rkei erkennen mit dem reifen an sich gab es kein problem
690287 bei david coulthard hat er gut funktioniert er fuhr einen langen ersten stint damit und startete mit einem schweren auto
690288 von der leistung her waren beide mischungen gut der superweiche reifen war aber besser als mehr gummi auf der bahn lag das zeigt auch die schnellste rennrunde von kimi r ikk nen
690289 naja das kann man nicht so einfach einordnen aber wenn man ein problem hat dann ist man gewiss nicht bei 100 prozent
690290 100 prozent bedeuten dass beide autos auf guten positionen ins ziel kommen
690291 dieses mal k nnen wir das nicht wirklich behaupten wir m ssen noch immer bei der entwicklung des autos gas geben d rfen aber die zuverl ssigkeit nicht aus den augen verlieren
690292 aber wir sind selbst nach diesem worst case szenario noch immer mitten im wm kampf und es sind noch sieben rennen zu fahren
690293 wir werden in den kommenden drei wochen in der fabrik kr ftig arbeiten die probleme l sen und uns in den bereichen verbessern wo wir defizite haben
690294 ich denke dass ich mich nach wie vor in einer sehr starken position befinde ich hoffe also dass ich mich weiterhin verbessern kann was der weltmeisterschaft und meiner zuversicht nur dienlich sein kann und das ist das wichtigste
690295 es gab in diesem jahr bereits einige rennen in denen ich in der lage war um den sieg zu k mpfen und in denen ich dann pech hatte
690296 nach der h lfte des heutigen grand prix begann sich das blatt f r mich zu wenden ich attackierte felipe massa nach kr ften und es funktionierte es tut mir leid f r ihn denn er fuhr ein gutes rennen
690297 mein auto lief super und ich sp rte dass der sieg drin war das ist jetzt ein toller moment auf diesen grand prix sieg habe ich viele jahre hingearbeitet das ist hoffentlich der erste erfolg von vielen
690298 gl ckwunsch an heikki zu seinem ersten grand prix sieg
690299 f r mich h tte das rennen heute besser laufen k nnen mein start war eigentlich ganz in ordnung aber felipe massa war schneller und schaffte es mich zu berholen ich fuhr gute rundenzeiten und hielt den abstand gering mit unserer strategie rechnete ich mir immer noch eine siegchance aus doch der reifenschaden zerst rte mein rennen
690300 ich wei nicht wie es dazu kam immerhin habe ich vier punkte geholt und die wm f hrung behauptet das ergebnis ist also nicht allzu schlimm
690301 eine der ltesten regeln im motorsport lautet to finish first you first have to finish klingt abgedroschen ist aber wahr
690302 es tut mir leid f r felipe massa denn er hat heute einen sehr guten job gemacht aber heikki fuhr hervorragend erzielte seinen ersten grand prix sieg und setzte seinen hervorragenden speed im qualifying den er die ganze saison ber zeigte in einen wohl verdienten erfolg um
690303 lewis rennen wurde dadurch beeintr chtigt dass er beim start die f hrung verlor
690304 wir gaben ihm beim ersten boxenstopp viel sprit f r einen langen zweiten stint mit und waren uns sicher dass er beim letzten stopp felipe massa berholen k nnte leider sollte das nicht sein durch einen bremsplatten und einen unabh ngig davon aufgetretenen reifenschaden verlor er seine siegchance
690305 immerhin h tte es noch schlechter f r ihn laufen k nnen heute war heikkis tag und was f r einer alle im mclaren mercedes team freuen sich mit ihm
690306 sorry f r felipe und ferrari lewis hatte pech mit seinem unverschuldeten reifenschaden felipe mit dem motor
690307 sensationell der erste erfolg von heikki er hat ihn verdient mit unseren finnen haben wir offensichtlich erfolg erst mika dann kimi und jetzt heikki lewis hatte ohne den reifenschaden gr te siegchancen er lag bis dahin im plan und seine strategie mit einem sp ten zweiten boxenstopp h tte ihn wohl vor massa gebracht
690308 mir tut es f r felipe und f r das team leid da es schrecklich ist ein rennen so zu verlieren
690309 es war f r mich hart denn wenn du eine lange zeit hinter einem langsameren auto verbringst dann wird es frustrierend und langweilig als ich schlie lich in der lage war druck zu machen da verhielt sich das auto sehr gut aber da war es schon zu sp t ich kam am ende hinter glock aber ich musste langsam machen da ich am heck ein mechanisches problem hatte und mir das team sagte dass ich sehr vorsichtig sein sollte um sicherzustellen dass ich das auto ins ziel bringe
690310 es stimmt dass ich derjenige bin der aus der top 3 der gesamtwertung die meisten punkte geholt hat was zeigt dass diese meisterschaft wirklich nicht vorhersagbar ist es gibt h hen und tiefen f r alle es war f r mich ein entt uschendes wochenende aber zumindest habe ich es geschafft ein ordentliches ergebnis zu erzielen wir m ssen versuchen die probleme zu beheben die wir im qualifying haben um von der spitze zu starten so dass wir das potenzial des autos aussch pfen k nnen wenn wir dies tun k nnen dann k nnen wir wieder um den sieg k mpfen
690311 ich managte das rennen denn ich hatte einen guten vorsprung auf den zweiten rang nachdem hamilton durch ein problem eingebremst wurde und ich ging berhaupt keine risiken ein im moment bin ich sehr frustriert denn heute hatten wir ein gro artiges auto und wir haben alles perfekt gemacht bis auf ein paar kilometer vor dem ziel
690312 ungl cklicherweise kann rennsport ein grausamer sport sein wir haben alles gegeben aber solche dinge k nnen passieren nun d rfen wir nicht aufgeben stattdessen m ssen wir schnell reagieren es sind noch sieben rennen zu fahren und 70 punkte zu holen was bedeutet dass es jede menge zeit gibt um boden gutzumachen unsere gegner sind stark aber wir haben gezeigt dass wir auf ihrem niveau sind
690313 es schmerzt ein auto bei nur noch ein paar verbleibenden runden mit einem defekt stehen bleiben zu sehen wenn man so solide in f hrung liegt
690314 das ist wirklich eine schande denn felipe fuhr ein au erordentliches rennen er hatte einen perfekten start war immer schnell unterwegs und er ging mit der situation in der schlussphase gro artig um kimi lag f r ein drittel des rennens hinter alonso und erst als er eine freie strecke vor sich hatte war er in der lage zu zeigen was er kann
690315 heute haben wir den wert unseres teams und unserer fahrer gezeigt
690316 heute haben wir gezeigt dass unser paket in der lage ist den job in bezug auf die leistung zu erledigen aber es mangelte uns an der notwendigen zuverl ssigkeit wir m ssen weiterhin arbeiten um uns weiter zu verbessern so wie das auch unsere gegner tun wir k nnen erwarten dass vor dem kommenden rennen ein paar wochen harter arbeit vor uns liegen wo wir erreichen wollen was uns heute im letzten moment durch die lappen gegangen ist
690317 heute haben wir den wert unseres teams und unserer fahrer gezeigt aber es mangelte uns an der totalen zuverl ssigkeit die absolut notwendig ist
690318 felipe fuhr wohl das beste rennen seiner karriere und wir sind sehr entt uscht ber das was ihm bei lediglich einer hand voll kilometer bis zum ende passierte er vollf hrte einen unglaublichen start attackierte im richtigen moment und dann managte er sein rennen in der letzten phase gut war auf dem wohlverdienten weg zu einem sieg
690319 after a long and careful analysis the results are clear 11 out of 10 people cant handle threads it gets too complex too fast i do not have fmri studies showing brains literally melting when thinking about multi threaded programs just many many anecdotes
690320 oo en gedeeld geheugen is tegennatuurlijk in het echt zie ik nergens objecten afgebakende processen die onderling gegevens uitwisselen door berichten dat is hoe wij mensen ook werken dat kunnen we begrijpen

690326 my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me
690327 i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress

690331 vi flyttade allt vi hann och kunde ste med hinkar tills vi ins g att det var meningsl st
690332 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe massa
690333 i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
690334 what can i do when i have a puncture last year i probably lost the championship on punctures i was a little bit disappointed with the fact i let felipe massa past but its nowhere near as bad as it could have been congratulations to heikki kovalainen and to timo glock
690335 the pre season games you dont put a lot of stock in
690336 we want to get the offence going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defence established
690337 theyre going to be thrust into a brand new situation and even the veteran players here they dont know what im going to expect on the sidelines
690338 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
690339 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
690340 great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
690341 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays
690342 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place

690382 petrus aber war jesus von weitem bis in den hof des hohepriesterlichen palastes gefolgt nun sa er dort bei den dienern und w rmte sich am feuer
690383 es war genug petrus kannte keine gefahr mehr er f rchtete den tod nicht mehr er eilte in die nacht hinaus der d mmerung entgegen mit zerknirschtem herzen und reum tig stand er vor dem eigenen gewissen das mit ihm ins gericht ging und dort wurden seine alte scham seine alte schw che sein altes ich zum tod verurteilt durch die g ttliche traurigkeit die zu einer neuen und edleren geburt f hren sollte
690384 zieht den neuen menschen an der nach dem bild gottes geschaffen ist in wahrer gerechtigkeit und heiligkeit
690385 siehe ich bin jesus christus von dem die propheten bezeugt haben er werde in die welt kommen ich bin das licht und das leben der welt
690386 wir reden von christus wir freuen uns ber christus wir predigen christus wir prophezeien prophezeien von christus
690387 alles ist durch das wort geworden und ohne das wort wurde nichts was geworden ist
690388 darum war am anfang das wort denn er war das wort n mlich der bote der errettung das licht und der erl ser der welt der geist der wahrheit der auf die welt kam weil die welt von ihm geschaffen wurde und in ihm war das leben der menschen und das licht der menschen die welten wurden von ihm geschaffen die menschen wurden von ihm geschaffen alles wurde von ihm und durch ihn und aus ihm geschaffen
690389 f r meinen eigenen zweck habe ich es geschaffen und durch das wort meiner macht habe ich sie erschaffen n mlich durch meinen einziggezeugten sohn der voller gnade und wahrheit ist und welten ohne zahl habe ich erschaffen und ich habe sie ebenfalls f r meinen eigenen zweck erschaffen und durch den sohn habe ich sie erschaffen n mlich durch meinen einziggezeugten
690390 so gingen die g tter hinab um den menschen als ihr abbild zu formen ihn zu gestalten als das abbild der g tter sie zu gestalten als mann und frau und die g tter sprachen wir wollen sie segnen
690391 mose antwortete gott wer bin ich da ich zum pharao gehen und die israeliten aus gypten herausf hren k nnte
690392 da sagte mose zu gott gut ich werde also zu den israeliten kommen und ihnen sagen der gott eurer v ter hat mich zu euch gesandt da werden sie mich fragen wie hei t er was soll ich ihnen darauf sagen da antwortete gott dem mose ich bin der ich bin da und er fuhr fort so sag zu den israeliten jahwe der gott eurer v ter der gott abrahams der gott isaaks der gott jakobs hat mich zu euch gesandt das ist mein name f r immer
690393 da wandte sich der hohepriester an ihn und fragte bist du der messias der sohn des hochgelobten jesus sagte ich bin es
690394 die juden entgegneten du willst abraham gesehen haben jesus erwiderte ihnen amen amen ich sage euch noch ehe abraham wurde bin ich
690395 wir sahen den herrn auf der brustwehr der kanzel vor uns stehen und die fl che unter seinen f en war mit lauterem gold ausgelegt in der farbe wie bernstein seine augen waren wie eine feuerflamme sein haupthaar war wei wie reiner schnee sein antlitz leuchtete heller als der glanz der sonne und seine stimme t nte wie das rauschen gro er gew sser ja die stimme jehovas die sprach ich bin der erste und der letzte ich bin der der lebt ich bin der der get tet worden ist

690400 die unsterblichkeit und das ewige leben des menschen zustande zu bringen
690401 jesus christus ist nicht der vater der geister die hier auf der erde bereits einen k rper angenommen haben bzw noch annehmen werden er ist vielmehr einer von ihnen er ist der sohn so wie auch sie s hne und t chter elohims sind
690402 siehe ich habe euch mein evangelium gegeben und dies ist das evangelium das ich euch gegeben habe ich bin in die welt gekommen um den willen meines vaters zu tun denn mein vater hat mich gesandt
690403 denn siehe ich gott habe das f r alle gelitten damit sie nicht leiden m ssen sofern sie umkehren aber wenn sie nicht umkehren wollen m ssen sie leiden wie ich und dieses leiden lie selbst mich gott den gr ten von allen der schmerzen wegen zittern aus jeder pore bluten und an leib und geist leiden und ich wollte den bitteren kelch nicht trinken m ssen sondern zur ckschrecken doch ehre sei dem vater ich trank davon und f hrte das was ich f r die menschenkinder vorhatte bis zum ende aus
690404 text geht es um die erschaffung adams der vorirdischen jesus spricht hier ber den vater
690405 und mein vater hat mich gesandt damit wie ich von den menschen emporgehoben wurde die menschen ebenso vom vater emporgehoben w rden um vor mir zu stehen um nach ihren werken gerichtet zu werden seien sie gut oder seien sie b se darum will ich gem der macht des vaters alle menschen zu mir ziehen damit sie gem ihren werken gerichtet werden
690406 der h ter des tores ist der heilige israels und er hat dort keinen knecht und es gibt keinen anderen weg als durch das tor und er kann nicht get uscht werden denn herr gott ist sein name
690407 ihr sollt also vollkommen sein wie es auch euer himmlischer vater ist
690408 darum m chte ich da ihr vollkommen seiet wie ich oder wie euer vater im himmel vollkommen ist
690409 jedes tal soll sich heben jeder berg und h gel sich senken was krumm ist soll gerade werden und was h glig ist werde eben

690422 und im vierundrei igsten jahr im ersten monat am vierten tage des monats erhob sich ein gro er sturm desgleichen man nie zuvor im lande erlebt hatte
690423 eine dichte finsternis im ganzen lande so da die einwohner die nicht gefallen waren den nebel der finsternis f hlen konnten
690424 und alles volk h rte sie und bezeugte da sie sagte 0 ihr bewohner dieser gro en st dte die gefallen sind ihr nachkommen jakobs die ihr vom hause israel seid wie oft habe ich euch versammelt wie eine henne ihre k chlein unter ihre fl gel versammelt und habe euch gen hrt wie oft wollte ich euch versammeln wie eine henne ihre k chlein versammelt doch ihr habt nicht gewollt
690425 das dritte mal verstanden sie die stimme die sie h rten und sie sagte zu ihnen sehet mein geliebter sohn an dem ich wohlgefallen habe in dem ich meinen namen verherrlicht habe h ret ihn und als sie verstanden erhoben sie ihre augen wieder gen himmel und sehet sie sahen einen mann vom himmel herniedersteigen der war mit einem wei en kleid angetan er kam herab und stand mitten unter ihnen und die augen des ganzen volkes waren auf ihn gerichtet und sie wagten nicht ihren mund aufzutun und miteinander zu reden und verstanden nicht was es bedeutete denn sie dachten da ihnen ein engel erscheine und er streckte seine hand aus und sagte zum volk sehet ich bin jesus christus von dem die propheten bezeugten da er in die welt kommen werde und sehet ich bin das licht und das leben der welt und ich habe aus dem bittern kelch getrunken den mir der vater gegeben hat und ich habe den vater verherrlicht indem ich die s nden der welt auf mich nahm worin ich mich dem willen des vaters in allen dingen von anbeginn unterwarf nachdem jesus diese worte gesprochen fiel alles volk zur erde nieder denn sie erinnerten sich da ihnen prophezeit worden war christus werde sich ihnen nach seiner himmelfahrt zeigen und der herr redete zu ihnen und sprach steht auf und kommt zu mir und legt eure h nde in meine seite und f hlt die n gelmale an meinen h nden und f en und wi t da ich der gott israels und der gott der ganzen erde bin und f r die s nden der welt get tet wurde und die menge trat herzu und sie legten ihre h nde in seine seite und f hlten die n gelmale an seinen h nden und f en und sie taten es und kamen alle hervor einer nach dem andern bis sie alle mit ihren augen gesehen und mit ihren h nden gef hlt hatten und mit bestimmtheit wu ten und zeugnis gaben da er es war der kommen sollte wie die propheten geschrieben hatten und nachdem alle hervorgekommen waren und selbst gesehen hatten riefen sie wie mit einer stimme und sagten hosianna gesegnet sei der name des allerh chsten gottes und sie fielen zu jesu f en nieder und beteten ihn an

690472 the launch of this years title is of a magnitude that only the rose bowl can accommodate
690473 maddenpalooza a games and music festival will take place on august 11th in pasadena and approximately 10 000 fans are expected at the stadium to get their hands on the game and hear bands like good charlotte play
690474 it seems like every year madden gets more and more realistic
690475 when i watch someone playing madden its like im watching a real nfl game the guys look so realistic and the features keep getting better
690476 madden does give you a feel for who some of the good players are
690477 the ratings and the rankings are pretty accurate you may know from playing madden that i need to watch out for that guy
690478 i know with tennessee last year id actually play the video game before going to the field
690479 its good to be able to know the players youre going to be playing against playing the video game was part of my preparation
690480 theyre going to really have fun with this game because theyre going to be able to explore the ins and outs and the behind the scenes stuff
690481 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away
690482 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
690483 we would now ask the media to respect his familys wishes and allow them privacy to grieve for ben
690484 they could ship me that medal today and i would ship it right back to them
690485 as the years go by i start losing some of the details
690486 what did surprise us was that we were playing the soviet teams game style we were playing guys who were stronger than we were but slow so we were playing their style of game as soon as we finally changed the tempo they started throwing the ball away
690487 i love the guy but when you react like that whether its in a high school championship or in the olympics you cant let yourself get into a situation like that it put us down two guys and we couldnt afford to be down two guys
690488 you dont worry much about a lead like that at that point a couple of missed baskets can turn a game around
690489 to this day were still close when he was fouled i knew he would make the free throws you take tiger woods or jack nicklaus when theyre down to the last putt you just know theyre going to make it i knew doug would make his he was the guy i wanted to have shooting those two foul shots
690490 in international olympic basketball you can call a time out after the first free throw
690491 if you want to call a time out there are ways to do it without leaving any doubt
690492 one of the officials told henry iba that unless he got his players back on the floor we would forfeit the game
690493 mcmillan later said to me that the ref had told him to back up but when mcmillan backed up he left the way clear for a pass to soviet player alexander belov sank a layup giving the russians the gold medal final score 51 50
690494 we couldnt believe that they were giving them the russians all those chances it was like they were going to let them do it until they got it right
690495 while we were alone in a room after the game
690496 we agreed that officials had taken the game from us our coaches were not around then so the decision we then made was one we made on our own we decided we would not accept the silver medal
690497 that was the players talking and they were saying they not accept the medal
690498 to this day i will not accept the medal one player kenny davis georgetown has it in his will to never accept it my former wife tried to get me to accept it for the sake of our kids i couldnt do it
690499 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
690500 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
690501 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
690502 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
690503 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
690504 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see

690514 selbst die einwohner hegen die bef rchtung dass ein grenzzaun errichtet werden wird um sie von jersusalem abzuschneiden so dass sie und das pal stinensische volk die nasen gegen den rost pressen werden so nah und doch so fern

690527 v proudly remains one of the safest festivals in the country and has a national reputation for its low crime trouble free environment
690528 this is largely due to months of detailed planning with the promoters
690529 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
690530 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
690531 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
690532 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
690533 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
690534 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
690535 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
690536 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
690537 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
690538 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
690539 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
690540 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
690541 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
690542 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
690543 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
690544 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
690545 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
690546 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do

690552 our ceramic bowls with finely woven sedge grass from swaziland have been created with multiple colors and textures of grass and include an inner core ceramic design each piece is uniquely made and beyond its beauty the bowl also tells a story of the women in swaziland true unknown artists and we are honored to present their works and to pay them a sustainable wage for their efforts

690554 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
690555 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
690556 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
690557 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
690558 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
690559 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
690560 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
690561 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
690562 anything that gets in the way of all of us as a team putting that message across effectively is a distraction from what needs to be done and is in danger of letting david cameron win by default
690563 we desperately need to find a way out of this mess and to end the personal dog fighting and to help restore some dignity to the standing of the labour party and our government
690564 in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges
690565 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some backing brown and others trying to knife him
690566 it is clear that the main political opportunities are where people are looking for an alternative to the labour government as they do in many northern cities and in the midlands where the tories are nowhere and we are the effective opposition
690567 it takes about 3 minutes for that to happen theres this veiled hatred
690568 weve kind of resolved that weve gotten to the age where we dont feel like fighting anymore because the end is a lot closer than the beginning

690583 estoy muy contento porque pude volver bien que es lo que m s quer a la verdad es que quiero agradecer a todos por el apoyo que me dieron siempre compa eros cuerpo t cnico y al club principalmente

690590 estaba muy gordo y no hac a nada de deporte aprend a ir en bici a los quince a os
690591 se fue el detonante de mi carrera porque fui quinto y eso me anim a acabar el a o
690592 fue la experiencia que m s me ha aportado a nivel personal en mi carrera deportiva pues aprend a trabajar en equipo y a desenvolverme en situaciones complicadas
690593 cumplir el convenio en esta materia y comprobar as que el consell s que cumple con todo aquello a lo que se compromete
690594 a diferencia de zapatero francisco camps es un presidente serio y responsable
690595 deber an ir m s encaminadas hacia la voluntad pol tica del gobierno al que representa
690596 son muchas las promesas incumplidas por zapatero de la vega y compa a y muchos los logros conseguidos por el ejecutivo del pp en la comunitat que ya ha destinado una importante partida presupuestaria a la seguridad ciudadana
690597 la experiencia nos dice que a quienes deber a vigilar es a los miembros de su propia casa
690598 por qu si tan intensamente trabaja el gobierno socialista en el contenido de la comisi n mixta como indica el propio peralta no se han retomado las reuniones sobre todo despu s de no se haya materializado nada por parte del ministerio del interior de lo que se trat hace casi un a o en la reuni n mantenida entre rubalcaba y el presidente camps
690599 seguramente porque no tienen nada que ofrecer porque zapatero ha dejado claro que para la comunitat no quiere ni una gota de agua
690600 pida a los valencianos que se esfuercen para que zapatero se sienta a gusto en la comunitat
690601 deber a ser al rev s tanto peralta como zapatero deber an esforzarse para que los valencianos se sintieran a gusto con el gobierno socialista
690602 si zapatero fuera el presidente que debiera ser y trajera el agua del ebro los 3 000 agentes que necesitamos la financiaci n acorde a nuestra poblaci n y las infraestructuras necesarias para nuestro desarrollo los valencianos le pondr an una alfombra roja pero se lamentablemente no es el caso
690603 al final parece que zapatero es un turista al que le tengamos que hacer la vida m s f cil alguien que viene a la comunitat a relajarse y pasar el tiempo pero los valencianos no queremos un presidente de gobierno que en lo que respecta a la comunitat est permanentemente de vacaciones
690604 el hecho de que el propio peralta prefiera no definirse como socialista demuestra que el delegado del gobierno no las tiene todas consigo a la hora de compartir las tesis del psoe en relaci n con la comunitat valenciana
690605 le ha tocado una plaza dif cil pues resulta muy complicado defender la gesti n del un ejecutivo que como el zapatero ignora las necesidades de nuestro territorio y se burla constantemente de la inteligencia de los ciudadanos
690606 nuestro objetivo es llegar lo mejor posible al inicio de la liga

690633 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
690634 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
690635 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
690636 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
690637 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
690638 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
690639 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

690666 well im just interested in it and i dont know where thats going to take me
690667 todays the last day and i have to know whether i can do this or not
690668 what can happen you go through the process and if it doesnt work out youve gained some knowledge you can pass on to other women through that process and if youre elected i believe it is gods will
690669 whats it like to be a male spouse of a female bishop
690670 where we go from here remains to be seen but there are good signs at this stage
690671 we talked about marriage and said no marriage of the same sex
690672 but still they went ahead and consecrated somebody who was gay
690673 what well see is the continued rise of the global south leadership the axis of power is shifting from the rich and the white to those who have less material resources but have the spiritual resources necessary to lead the communion further
690674 all these people brought christianity to us but now the church is growing here like wildfire
690675 its spreading everywhere while the church in england is withering while the church in the states is going away completely
690676 it is not an option to hope that we can somehow just carry on as we always have
690677 the interesting question still unanswered is how wide and deep will it grow
690678 the episcopal church as an organization is changing its teaching and theology and is moving away from the traditions of the church
690679 its been slowly accelerating over the years and it picked up steam when they began blessing same sex unions a few years back
690680 if it was a black person or women in robinsons place some may be upset but not say it out loud but because hes gay they say it out loud
690681 one of the greatest strengths about the episcopal church is the whole diversity of views
690682 the episcopal church in its history has not been a very dogmatic church its been a church thats allowed people to question to have doubts and fears and all that i think is a part of a healthy and mature faith
690683 we have never unlike most churches never defined ourselves by theology or doctrine we defined ourselves by how we worship
690684 i think well weather this a lot of people make a lot of noise and i think in the end people have a kind of attachment to the episcopal church
690685 there is no mechanism in the church to help us discipline a branch of our church that is teaching and practicing heresy
690686 that conforming your life to christ doesnt necessarily mean giving up a homosexual lifestyle
690687 such actions and views as those above fly in the face of the clear teaching of the holy scriptures and the resolutions of the lambeth conference 1998 rowan williams would not have the confidence of the vast majority of anglicans in the world who are now in the third world and who as loyal anglicans take the holy scriptures as their supreme authority his appointment would lead to a major split in the anglican communion including the church of england
690688 if his consecration proceeds many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of communion with the episcopal church usa this will tear the fabric of our communion at its deepest level and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the episcopal church usa
690689 strangely before the deadline and before the primates could get the opportunity of meeting to assess the adequacy of the response of tec the episcopal church and in a clear demonstration of unwillingness to follow through our collective decisions which for many of us was an apparent lack of regard for the primates lambeth palace in july 2007 issued invitations to tec bishops including those who consecrated gene robinson to attend the lambeth 2008 conference at this point it dawned upon us regrettably that the archbishop of canterbury was not interested in what matters to us in what we think or in what we say
690690 we cannot succumb to this turmoil in our communion and simply watch helplessly we have found ourselves in a world in which anglican leaders hold on to a form of religion but consistently deny its power
690691 every bishop to teach and to uphold sound and wholesome doctrine and to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange opinion
690692 lets talk about knife crime and the poor and not sexuality
690693 this issue of homosexuality in the anglican communion has a very serious effect in my country we are called infidels by the moslems that means that they will do whatever they can against us to keep us from damaging the people of our country they challenge our people to convert to islam and leave the infidel anglican church when our people refuse sometimes they are killed these people are very evil and mutilate and harm our people i am begging the communion on this issue so no more of my people will be killed
690694 is grounded in the holy scriptures and in such teachings of the ancient fathers and councils of the church as are agreeable to the said scriptures in particular such doctrine is to be found in the thirty nine articles of religion the book of common prayer and the ordinal
690695 it professes the faith which is uniquely revealed in the holy scriptures of the old and new testament as containing all things necessary for salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith and which is set forth in the catholic creeds and to which the historic formularies of the church of england bear significant witness which faith the church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation
690696 would respect the dogmas of the church epitomized in the creeds as showing in the language and thought forms of the age that produced them balanced and authoritative affirmations excluding false theological solutions and including the necessary theological ingredients for such christians however both doctrines and dogmas are so inadequate to the living reality of whom they are the attempted theological formulations that they cannot command full commitment or loyalty in the best sense of the word they are provisional
690697 in our doings that will of god is to be followed which we have expressly declared unto us in the word of god
690698 in scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong monogamous heterosexual union as the setting intended by god for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable
690699 the object of my school is to is to show how many extraordinary things even a lazy and ordinary man may see if he can spur himself to the single activity of seeing
690700 the most significant trend in michigans labor market in 2007 was the decline in the states work force

690725 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny
690726 she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
690727 they were all in great moods and very friendly to everyone
690728 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
690729 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
690730 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
690731 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues
690732 but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
690733 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
690734 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare

690740 sufism is a way of love a way of devotion and way of knowledge sufism is often described as a path suggesting both an origin and destination the aim of sufism is the elimination of all veils between the individual and god
690741 sufism which is without any religious obligations regards spirituality as the religion of the heart
690742 sufism is an attitude of inner sympathy towards all beliefs all religions are sufi religions as long as they recognize the limits inherent in any speculative interpretation of truth one might say that sufism is a process leading to the widening of the horizon of the heart so that truth may shine within as a brilliant sun illuminating all that is receptive of its rays of light
690743 some say to be pure means to be free from all evil thought but in reality there is no evil thought and if there is any such thought which one could call evil or devilish it is the thought of bitterness against another in his heart if a drop of poison can cause the death of the body it is equal to a thousand deaths when the heart retains the smallest thought of bitterness in this legend the cutting open of the breast is the cutting open of the ego which is like a shell over the heart and the removing of that element means that every kind of thought or feeling against anyone in the world has been taken away and the breast which means the heart is filled with love alone which is the real life of god

690805 creo que es justo el marcador porque las que tuvimos las metimos de eso se trata el futbol nosotros nos fijamos solo en nuestro equipo sin importar lo que pase enfrente es la forma de trabajar de nuestra instituci n
690806 salimos muy contentos apenas es la segunda fecha pero yo creo que es un merecido triunfo debido a que cada punto vale oro le sali un golazo de chilena y al ngulo fue un muy bonito gol pero gracias a dios salimos con la victoria
690807 por suerte el equipo gan y es lo m s importante jugamos ante un gran equipo frente a su gente y hacerle cuatro goles despu s de ir perdiendo es un gran m rito de nosotros
690808 el equipo est muy unido sabemos lo que queremos el partido contra chivas jugamos bien y no merec amos perder y bueno hoy hicimos nuestro juego y nos vamos felices

690812 se jug bien y se gan que es lo m s importante con un rival que no te regala nada por los jugadores con los que cuenta son circunstancias del partido al idea es esa entrar para aportar por suerte se dio todo para que el equipo siga sumando puntos en el torneo
690813 me sent a gusto con el equipo arrancamos no jugando bien pero despu s supimos sobreponernos de ir en desventaja porque no es f cil ir perdiendo y remontar el marcador por todo esto contento

690902 on april 6 1915 w w prescott wrote a letter to w c white in which he raised some very sensitive issues and made some very pointed comments about the writings of mrs white
690903 prepared two books on education for the press from manuscripts he had received and mrs white saw none of the final drafts before they went to press she was in australia at the time he alone did the unsupervised editing and preparing of the ms for the press
690904 never wrote the prefaces of her books she of course heard them read over but she never reads the proof you know doctor that sister white never in the office sat down and read proofs properly

690907 why did the brethren feel they could have so much liberty with sister whites writings

690909 has the full amount of the washington fund been raised
690910 yes it has and several thousand dollars overflow has come in
690911 this is to signify that we deem it to be the wise and christian part to act toward our brethren in nashville to place the first five thousand dollars surplus that has come in to washington in the hands of these faithful servants of god that they may secure the house of worship in nashville which they greatly need we deem that it is but loving our neighbor as ourselves to make this transfer of means to a place where at this time there is so great a necessity

690921 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
690922 the holy spirit has a personality else he could not bear witness to our spirits and with our spirits that we are the children of god he must also be a divine person else he could not search out the secrets which lie hidden in the mind of god

690933 during miss harmons now mrs white visit paris me in the summer of 1845 i stated to her particulars of a dear friend of mine whose father prevented her from attending our meetings consequently she had not rejected light she smilingly replied god never has shown me that there is no salvation for such persons it is only those who have had the light of truth presented to them and knowingly rejected it miss harmons reply coincided with my idea of a shut door and in justice no other could be derived from it
690934 we the undersigned having been well acquainted with the advent movement in 1844 at the passing of the time and having also embraced the truths of the third angels message as early as 1850 hereby cheerfully subscribe our names to the following statement concerning the shut door doctrine held by believers in the third angels message from the time of its rise to the last mentioned date and onward
690935 they believed that those who had the clear light upon the first angels message and turned against it bitterly opposing it were rejected of god
690936 while they believed with william miller and the great mass of adventists immediately after the passing of time that their work for the world was done and that the lord would come very soon yet after the light upon the sanctuary and the third message explained their disappointment they did not believe that mercy was past save for those who had rejected the light
690937 quem passou pela vida em brancas nuvens passou pela vida e n o viveu
690938 these are they who have once kept the sabbath and have given it up
690939 it is not but the city is my home and i have come to visit this place
690940 by very nature it is a labyrinth and chaos this what we call human history an abatis of trees and brushwood a world wide jungle at once growing and dying
690941 by wise memory and by wise oblivion it lies all there
690942 the curtain is drawn aside and we behold behind above and through all the play and counterplay of human interests and power and passions the agencies of the all merciful one silently patiently working out the counsels of his own will
690943 as a people we are brought together from divisions of the advent body the millerites and from the various denominations holding different views on some subjects yet thank heaven the sabbath is a mighty platform on which we can all stand united
690944 to be left without a rule of faith we answer that she is provided with a creed that is sufficient all scripture is given by inspiration of god
690945 the bible and the bible alone the rule of faith and duty
690946 the law of god as taught in the old and new testaments unchangeable
690947 the personal advent of christ and the resurrection of the just before the millennium
690948 the earth restored to its eden perfection and glory the final inheritance of the saints
690949 immortality alone through christ to be given to the saints at the resurrection
690950 in presenting to the public this synopsis of our faith we wish to have it distinctly understood that we have no articles of faith creed or discipline aside from the bible we do not put forth this as having any authority with our people nor is it designed to secure uniformity among them as a system of faith but is a brief statement of what is and has been with great unanimity held by them
690951 a declaration of the fundamental principles taught and practiced by the seventh day adventists
690952 have no creed but the bible but they hold to certain well defined points of faith for which they feel prepared to give a reason
690953 to consider it carefully and to send comments or suggestions

690958 im sorry for offending i was referring specifically to rabbi allen proponents was the wrong word to use i was trying to avoid naming anyone in particular i apologize for my poor choice of words which implied that all people who support ht do not keep kosher i do not believe that to be the case at all
690959 second it is common in ny for those keeping kosher to order food into a nonkosher restaurant
690960 excuse me please tell guest this is a verry religious affair nothing goes out undrressed
690961 so then theres nothing wrong since it is under rabbinical supervision
690962 rabbi i saw you watching me and realized that the place was under rabbinival supervision
690963 bugs that cannot be seen plainly with the naked eye
690964 bacharach believes her actions and rabbi sic allens actions are permitted
690965 presumably no orthodox rabbi believes abusing workers is okay they invoke lashon hara not because rubashkin is truly presumed innocent but because the opposite is true
690966 as an fully egalitarian congregation we value diversity welcome interfaith families and emphasize inclusion
690967 so the bug matter for vegan and vegetarian restaurants should be a non issue

690972 you can hardly expect the company to know of all issues
690973 i have never seen nor have i ever heard of shooting before shchita
690974 that is rare and i know of no other shooting after shchita
690975 selling non glatt as glatt is a serious accusation which i am unaware of
690976 i will ask the shochtim if it is true that they cannot talk to outside rabbonim
690977 which takanos are you referring to concerning treif operations and oxtails and are you familiar with the layout of agrip and the degree of separation between the two departments
690978 i dont know what theft you are referring to nor what tracking system you expect and how the two issues connect
690979 i have never seen shooting before shchita nor do i know of any reason to do such a thing
690980 i am told the glatt percentage here has always been lower than the percentage at alle
690981 the local representatives of the hechsherim definitely have free run of the plant

690987 i apologize for my poor choice of words which implied that all people who support ht do not keep kosher i do not believe that to be the case at all
690988 if i remembered incorrectly misunderstood or came to a wrong conclusion i apologize as i have in the past on this issue
690989 i remember reading a quote by rabbi a in which he stated that he is a vegetarian but he does eat at non kosher restaurants
690990 i will not defend my comment until i find the quote
690991 i found out who the squealer was and hes been taken care of

691005 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
691006 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
691007 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
691008 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
691009 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
691010 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
691011 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
691012 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

691017 we try to keep his spirits up by saying something will change in the law
691018 should suffer harsh criminal consequences for acting as a lookout in this case but to suggest that he ought to receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole i find to be very very hard to swallow to the point where i can describe it as unconscionable
691019 he was convicted for the crimes of being poor and mexican
691020 hes just one of many there are so many people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes hes a regular guy who was trying to make a living

691022 the recidivism rate for older inmates is less than 2 percent
691023 technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so

691029 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
691030 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
691031 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
691032 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
691033 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
691034 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
691035 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever

691055 the solidarity website is served up by lambertus nieuwhofs company noisy dinosaur as is accentuate lambertus nieuwhof for those who dont recognise the name was one of a trio of men who planted a home made bomb at the calvary church school in south africa in protest against the schools decision to become racially mixed when the bomb failed to go off one of them lost his nerve gave himself up to the police and turned in his two associates one of which was nieuwhof at the end of the resulting court case he received what searchlight rightly stated was a derisory twelve month suspended prison sentence
691056 we heard recently that he was asked by griffin to watch over richard barnbrook at the london assembly to make sure he stays out of trouble
691057 paypal have already suspended the solidarity account because of complaints
691058 allegations of money laundering sounds like nick grifin is somehow involved here the paypal account is not the only likely fraudulent issue with squalidarity
691059 the certification office is investigating allegations of financial irregularities and breaches of both the law and solidaritys constitution
691060 the certification office will issue a ruling on whether the harrington bnp takeover was legitimate
691061 such calims and and counter claims are not capable of being determined in an administrative manner by this office
691062 as i have said in previous correspondence trade unions are voluntary organisations that are for the most part left to regulate their own affiars via their rule books
691063 the final paragraph is a clear enough statement that the certification officer intends to make no judgement or ruling on the legality or otherwise of the harrington takeover and so whatever the outcome of this investigation into the financial affairs of solidarity the fake union will remain in the hands of harrington and the bnp unless the official executive have the wherewithal to take the matter to law
691064 something we do know for certain is that the executive of official solidarity recently held a meeting to discuss the way forward in the event of the certification office ruling in their favour the meeting concluded that the name of solidarity had been so badly damaged by its close association with the british national party and had attracted so little interest even from bnp members that there was no point in continuing with the operation and they would disband it
691065 why are you in that body with such knowledge as yours why are you in a vyadhas body and doing such filthy ugly work
691066 no duty is ugly no duty is impure my birth placed me in these circumstances and environments in my boyhood i learnt the trade i am unattached and i try to do my duty well i try to do my duty as a householder and i try to do all i can to make my father and mother happy i neither know your yoga nor have i become a sannyasin nor did i go out of the world into a forest nevertheless all that you have heard and seen has come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which belongs to my position

691069 the green delegate challenge is a critical part of that effort
691070 weve been credited in a number of studies for being transparent with everything except for financials
691071 we typically bid against many of our competitors so disclosing our financials doesnt make sense
691072 these are folks who would not risk their reputations by working with any carbon offset provider that wasnt the best in class
691073 because they would be under the microscope and thats why were working with the dnc
691074 nobody likes to be misled the green dnc convention is an absolute sham
691075 but its sitting up there on the hill and its just a work in progress
691076 i told nativeenergy and the dnc it was not running
691077 i think their whole deal was well it will be running
691078 it is not uncommon for the media to take pot shots at the nansy pansy liberalism that embraces all things green
691079 do we have the intellectual honesty to objectively measure the magnitude of climate change resource depletion etc and gauge the necessary response
691080 it gave people the opportunity to see that boston could do a big event that clearly has helped going forward denver will see the same benefit

691135 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
691136 im we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it and that is what campaigns are going to be like thats what every that i have been involved in has been like i am going to enjoy it and im the underdog and we will continue to fight and scrap all the way to november fourth
691137 given the seriousness of the issues given the fact that the decisions we make right now are going to help determine the future not just of the next generation but perhaps generations after that given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think wed been having a serious conversations about solutions to our problems but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
691138 is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people
691139 even the media has pointed out that senator john mccain who started off talking about running an honorable campaign has fallen back into the predictable political attacks the demonstrably false statements
691140 im not interested into getting into a tit for tat these negative ads these negative attacks spending all this time talking about me instead of talking about what hes going to do thats not going to lower your gas prices its politics as a game but the time for game playing is over

691151 i agree with him that 75 percent is unrealistic but somewhere between 10 percent and 75 percent is reasonable
691152 today practice ended and im like its over lets go lets do some more
691153 it definitely drives me every team passed on me thats something ill never forget and thats going to drive me for this whole season if nothing else thatll do it alone
691154 i realized that having just another golf outing or having another fundraiser
691155 no root for you a series of tutorials rants and raves and other random nuances therein
691156 i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
691157 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way
691158 its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
691159 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
691160 kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
691161 it hurts to see a car stop with a failure just a few laps from the end when you are solidly in the lead
691162 we have not found the actual cause but there is a high possibility of a puncture
691163 we could not see any debris on the tread surface although we could not analyse the shoulder area because he ran half of a lap with a depressed front tyre and the sidewalls were badly damaged so the possibility is of a side cut and then after that it depressed suddenly
691164 when there is a flat spot it means there is a very thin shoulder area close to the ground so maybe a sharp stone touched the sidewall meaning there was a possibility to cause a puncture
691165 the confidence is there i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race
691166 we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
691167 i am sure it is not a great feeling when things looked already finished with only two laps to go and then you just hear something and have a strange feeling in the car as the engine breaks down for sure it is not a great feeling i feel really bad and not happy for what has happened
691168 we did a perfect job today and then we just gave it away because two laps to go is not really a fantastic feeling i feel very bad but unfortunately this is part of our sport
691169 now we need to think forward and we need to think about the next race we have a little bit of a break now which will be good to prepare our energy for the last seven races
691170 well i think my race was done on the start
691171 the start was the only place where we could have passed lewis hamilton and had the opportunity to win the race so that is why i took a lot of risk but it worked
691172 i think i made a great start and we showed incredible pace afterwards

691247 stu has shown a lot of confidence in andrew and matt
691248 theyve taken that as great responsibility not only to stu but to the organization and the community its very refreshing to me to see an owner who has so much trust and confidence in his upper management to allow them to do some of the things weve done here
691249 youve got to give andrew friedman a lot of credit
691250 hes just beginning his career as general manager and he has shown remarkable insight and feel for the game he made some moves that werent heralded at the time but have worked out real well
691251 we decided pitching and defense was what was going to get us to the next level
691252 we were discussing a contract with him and we were quite certain we were going to get it done we just felt it was best not to have the spotlight on him at the beginning there was no question he was going to be in the major leagues
691253 id like to say there was a magic bullet to this as far as a player or two
691254 we had three players in the all star game they didnt exactly jump off the page they werent slam dunks it has been the ultimate team effort its been done with pitching and defense for the most part
691255 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

691342 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
691343 not because it asked the question is barack obama ready for the job thats a very legitimate criticism and i think barack obama made it a little bit worse by his stumbling response later the problem is that mccain mccains strategy has to hinge in my view on one thing how does a republican survive in october and november a huge anti republican vote luckily for the party mccain is a different kind of republican so everything in the campaign ought to build toward that case and when if you get off into the small juvenile stuff about britney spears i think you distract from that

691359 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
691360 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
691361 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
691362 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today

691374 it wouldnt surprise me if i was in a cup car by the end of the year racing
691375 i think at this point there may be certain people who are pushing very hard to do a full cup season next year i think it looks like i will do a full truck season and do a lot of cup racing the whole thing is adapting very well i didnt expect the test to go as well as it did it went really well there will be more cup tests there will be cup racing from that we decide what we want to do
691376 its shorter racing its fun with cool guys more laid back saying that i havent raced cup yet we take it one step at a time were in no hurry i know theres a car waiting for me i know ill have a proper chance to see if i will be successful and i honestly think i will be successful in it its just a matter of time
691377 we have the expectation of putting scott in a cup car at some point this year
691378 but we dont want to distract from what we are trying to do with brian and aj either weve been pleased obviously with scotts progress having said that were not in a situation where we need to find a driver we dont have to rush to find someone to put in a car its something we can take our time with to make sure we do it the right way

691486 suggesting that the fourth gospel is not directly dependent on the synoptics need not imply that john did not know of the existence of the synoptics even if as is unlikely johannine christianity were as isolated from other circles of christianity as some have proposed other gospels must have been known if travelers afforded any contact at all among christian communities

691507 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
691508 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
691509 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya

691511 lots of ranch on the side like extra ranch my wife is pregnant and she wants the extra ranch
691512 maybe the lesson is there are limits to what we can and cannot do in iraq ive tried separating myself from our work with the sahawa
691513 and i cant i cant ever face the tribes i worked with again because i broke a lot of promises those promises dont mean much to anyone outside diwaniya or to an overall strategy for this war but i thought these were the promises my own government had sent me year after year to pursue so while i would deploy again for my marines and my iraqi army comrades i dont want to go to iraq again if this is the way we do business
691514 this war is critical to our national security interests and has had an impact on al qaeda i know we are creating a buffer zone
691515 we will not create a well functioning democracy in iraq but we need to leave the region and iraq in a stronger position than we went in both for their own security and to avoid another terrorist attack on america i would do whatever general petraeus asked or needed i trust him and his character with my life
691516 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
691517 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
691518 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
691519 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
691520 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

691541 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
691542 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
691543 there is no doubt in my mind that sen obama is trying to suggest that he is the victim of something
691544 what he was saying all along is that he has a different kind of resume
691545 what he was saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader
691546 too much confusion when you talk about lindsey and drilling
691547 good heavens woman this is a war not a garden party
691548 the president knows that we resolve nothing by taking these kinds of punitive actions
691549 he says he wants comprehensive reform yet all he does is enforcement with no steps to legalize the status of those workers

691555 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
691556 i believe most americans want their next president to remind them of the guy who they work with not the guy who laid them off

691564 he wants to get together with his partner and decide what kind of help they need
691565 its a consulting service its free of charge its done by students under faculty supervision and the students work with small businesses that request our help
691566 some are majoring in finance some are majoring in marketing some in accounting some in information systems and so these teams work together
691567 a lot of these companies are just starting and have no idea where theyre going and what theyre doing they need a business plan they need a direction and the center offers that
691568 i thought it was really great that the school was giving back to the community and really trying to help the sacramento economy by helping smaller businesses kind of move up in the world
691569 this gives them a chance to see what the real world is like and to apply the theories and principles that theyve learned in their classes and that makes for a more meaningful experience
691570 the money is now there every year unless it is taken out
691571 agriculture is a more than 1 billion industry that is obviously vital to delawares economy and our quality of life
691572 i want to do everything i can to assist our farmers
691573 increased funding will provide better incentives for our farmers to take advantage of improvements in available crop insurance products
691574 the money was pulled out in the first year of the ehrlich administration
691575 farmers would not have crop insurance without the federal premium subsidy
691576 we are working to ensure that csu employees will receive their regular paychecks and can expect their normal compensation until a new budget is signed
691577 at the same time we are looking at paying compensation with alternative revenue sources other than the state general fund in an effort to cooperate with the governor and the legislature in this challenging budget environment
691578 we are going to be prudent in our hiring but the csu needs to be prepared to serve the record number of students that will be enrolling on campuses for the fall semester beginning in august to be responsive the csu will need to hire faculty and staff to help meet the needs of those students
691579 this is a great compliment to our entire coaching staff and a collective group of student athletes who are committed to excellence
691580 it also reflects our commitment to a broad based athletic program
691581 we are fortunate to have coaches and staff who care about the total student athlete experience and this recognition reflects their passion and abilities i couldnt be prouder of this recognition on behalf of our university and athletics program

691584 the opportunity for the university to promote its educational social and community programs at no cost to the school provides exceptional benefit to both the campus and the community
691585 it would cost thousands of dollars to promote campus events and messages in a high traffic location such as highway 50
691586 anytime we have an avenue to publicize current events whether its tragedies or safety reminders is definitely a great thing
691587 hell would have to freeze over for us to sell dean to a major rival it would be no surprise to us if there are certain clubs who would be interested in him but we worked very hard to put together a deal to keep dean at the club and he remains a massive part of our ambitious plans
691588 we have improved each time we play this season and i am convinced we can gather maximum points against dynamos

691595 as communication professors we believed in a direct communications approach
691596 but when it comes to death and dying most people cant talk about it with the patient or the patients friends and family i know our story can help people even those who arent directly touched by cancer so they understand the depth of the experience
691597 its an unflinching look at what leah went through during her cancer and what i went through during my grief
691598 some people dont know what to say to those who have lost someone
691599 shortly after leahs death someone actually said i know what youre going through my dog just died people try to be comforting but dont understand what it is to lose someone to cancer
691600 i applaud nick trujillo for his courage to share the story of his love for his wife who sadly lost her battle with cancer it is both touching and inspiring
691601 together trujillo and vande berg have created a book that is both difficult to read and difficult to put down
691602 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
691603 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
691604 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
691605 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
691606 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
691607 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
691608 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
691609 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
691610 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
691611 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
691612 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
691613 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
691614 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
691615 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
691616 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
691617 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
691618 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
691619 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes

691624 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
691625 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
691626 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
691627 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
691628 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
691629 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
691630 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
691631 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
691632 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
691633 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
691634 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
691635 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
691636 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
691637 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
691638 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
691639 benji never seems to have cash on him to pay for things and tip people which means paris always carries cash around

691641 i do think there is room for an 18 rated batman its a little bit tricky to broach the sex aspect of the story when you want kids to come see it as well i mean i think it would be very interesting to do a 12 version and an 18 version two different cuts
691642 that should do it i bet no one can see me now
691643 feelings dont last forever please try to make it through this weather the storm is breaking cant you see that you were meant for great things
691644 if mccain chooses someone like cantor it please multiple classes of politicos top flight donors potential cabinet members and national grade consultants who have earned the spot as presidential campaign advisers cantor has a stable of folks around him both current and former consultants he remains close to that could make a mccain cantor ticket very formidable

691664 thus said hashem whoever remains in this city will die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence whereas whoever goes out in surrender to the chaldeans will live he will have his life as a booty and he will live
691665 thus said hashem this city will surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of babylonia and he will capture it
691666 let this man be put to death now because he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking to them such things for this man does not seek the welfare of this people but rather their detriment
691667 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realized when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimeter piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition

691674 gender differences in math performance even among high scorers are insufficient to explain lopsided gender patterns in participation in some science and math fields

691683 has a right to represent the people of his district and he has a right to his opinion the input that the consortium has gotten from people in granville county has been that the nbaf is a positive thing for the county
691684 well it does lead one to wonder whether the n c biotech officials are deaf blind or just dumb
691685 the consortium wants to provide information to the citizens of granville county so that they can make a decision based on facts
691686 im kind of baffled as to how this is supposed to be educating the citizens of granville county
691687 i think tolson and n c biotech and the consortium as whole keeps hoping that if they state their position frequently enough it will somehow become true
691688 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
691689 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
691690 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive

691692 you can never say that the system is 100 percent secure
691693 but the research ethic today is one of much greater discipline and focus on security than was true prior to the anthrax attacks
691694 you have all these universities tripping over each other trying to be high level biosecurity labs

691703 i was very fortunate i had the chance to read writers like mariama ba aime cesaire and leopold sedar senghor i read him when i was 20
691704 when i saw sidney poitier on screen i was probably 10 or 11
691705 that was a different image an image i had never seen before on screen
691706 the african americans i saw they danced they were buffoons that was the image so sidney brought another image
691707 global warming increases the probabilities of floods and strong hurricanes and that is all that you can say
691708 the intensity has not really been excessive on a short term scale
691709 climate shift to unprecedentedly dry weather along with diversion of water for irrigation has converted this former reservoir in chinas minqin county into desert
691710 your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts
691711 i agree that women are the lower species because every society has had only a few female leaders where you cant name many women its not my critique its in their societies views
691712 will females dominate in the future yes generation y will definitely take over right after maternity leave you see women going right back to work
691713 people should write about their illnesses even if they have fictionalized details if many people write about it it will show its more common if it hasnt been given a label yet
691714 a majority of people stick to their own traditions and thoughts but it is different for urbanites when you dont interact with different backgrounds you stagnate
691715 without going into either the ethics or the necessities of this case we have reached so much common ground the female of genus homo is supported by the male whereas in other species of animals male and female alike graze and browse hunt and kill climb swim dig run and fly for their livings in our species the female does not seek her own living in the specific activities of our race but is fed by the male
691716 they couldnt exist its ethically wrong and nobody would take them
691717 it would be terrible because they are in the work force and making contributions to society it would be a regression

691766 sesungguhnya para ulama itu adalah pewaris para nabi dan para nabi itu tidaklah mewariskan dinar dan dirham mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barang siapa yang mengambilnya berarti dia telah mengambil warisan yang banyak
691767 dan kami turunkan kepadamu agar kamu menerangkan kepada umat manusia apa yang telah diturunkan kepada mereka
691768 semoga alloh membaguskan wajah orang yang mendengarkan sabdaku lalu menghafalnya dan menyampaikannya sebagaimana dia mendengarnya bisa jadi orang yang diberitahu lebih paham daripada orang yang mendengar dari rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wa sallam terkadang orang yang membawa fikih bukanlah orang yang faqih dan bisa jadi pembawa fikih membawanya kepada orang yang lebih bisa memahaminya

691799 artinya ibnu abbas berkata janganlah kalian mencaci maki atau menghina para shahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sesungguhnya kedudukan salah seorang dari mereka bersama rasulullah sesaat sejam itu lebih baik dari amal seorang dari kalian selama 40 empat puluh tahun
691800 artinya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tidak akan masuk neraka seseorang yang ikut serta dalam perang badar dan perjanjian hudaibiyyah
691801 artinya mudah mudahan allah menerima taubat mereka sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
691802 artinya setiap anak adam bersalah dan sebaik baik orang yang bersalah adalah yang bertaubat
691803 ya rabb kami beri ampunlah kami dan saudara saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih dahulu dari kami dan janganlah engkau membiarkan kedengkian dalam hati kami terhadap orang orang yang beriman ya rabb kami sesungguhnya engkau maha penyantun lagi maha penyayang

691940 ste es un asunto viejo que karadzic comenz en 1996
691941 y para explicarlo a su propia gente se invent entonces esta historia que ha adornado durante doce a os pero no hay ninguna verdad en ello
691942 no hubo ning n acuerdo por el que radovan karadzic pudiese haber beneficiarse de inmunidad para ser juzgado o arrestado

691955 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
691956 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
691957 your debate about the future of the settlements and about the necessity of the presence in the territories just served to strengthen us to continue with the terrorist attacks the people of the peace camp in israel those who spoke of the end of the occupation and of retreat pushed us forward in our decision to continue with the suicide bombings
691958 but the cracks in your resistance encouraged us greatly and proved that this instrument suicide bombings ij was very effective ariel sharons disengagement plan from gaza is a great achievment that is a result of our actions one of the best pieces of evidence for us of the fracture in the israeli society as a result of the suicide bombings was the refusenik phenomenon we thought we should further deepen this fracture and the use of suicde bombers became a matter of consensus in the organisation

692000 we have been receiving bodies in heaps since the first truckload arrived around 2 pm there is not even enough space to put up the bodies properly so we have put them up in all available places
692001 there were hardly any policemen at naina devi keeping in view the crowds that came sunday and when the rumour of a landslide led to mayhem and stampede the policemen only aggravated the situation by cane charging people two of my nieces died in the stampede but i was able to save many others

692004 a lot of people have been doubting this kerry team
692005 we learned hard lessons from the league defeat to derry and the munster final to cork
692006 it was time to stand up for ourselves and i think we did that today against a good monaghan side all credit to monaghan they pushed us all the way and were just delighted to come through it
692007 there has to be more to come from this kerry team and right now were just looking forward to next week
692008 it was important for us to bounce back from the munster final
692009 although we still showed some rustiness out there we still got important scores when it mattered
692010 we still need to improve before next week but the important thing is there is still more to come from this kerry team
692011 its the hardest decision i ever had to make but also the easiest

692026 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
692027 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
692028 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
692029 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
692030 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
692031 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
692032 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
692033 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
692034 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
692035 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
692036 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
692037 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
692038 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
692039 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
692040 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
692041 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
692042 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
692043 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
692044 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
692045 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
692046 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy

692049 my maternal uncle is shiite and before they were unable to visit us at all now they do visit us regularly but at the same time they have to be careful not to make themselves conspicuous just in case
692050 we used to be terrified of the forces manning checkpoints because they had the authority to question us and we just didnt know which way to lie
692051 they could be anything now we fear only about 25 percent of them which we can call a development
692052 all we want is to be able to enter any neighborhood without having to make calculations walk down streets without fear be able to make new friends right now we still cant
692053 they have a lot of very big challenges but one of the things is working with the other institutions including the army and the intelligence service
692054 they need to get everybody lined up in the same direction if they are going to tackle the terrorist problem
692055 the timing lets say a month ago would have been different for bush to come
692056 it is not only playing into the domestic political processes but to possibly even be utilized politically in a very unproductive manner it is purely domestic politics it happens anywhere in the world
692057 he has a lot on the line and we are getting to the very difficult period on the issue of verification of the declaration the north koreans have provided on their nuclear program
692058 our message is the united states believes in democracy and freedom
692059 when the bush administration pays attention to southeast asia its about burma so the us foreign policy has really not fully engaged in the region
692060 i think it would be good for these athletes who have worked hard to see their president waving that flag
692061 the president simply cant go as a human being enjoying sports the president goes with the full weight and prestige of the united states when he sits at the opening ceremonies and sees the celebration of china
692062 he said he was going immediately so it was much more difficult for him to backtrack from that without seeming to humiliate or embarrass the chinese people in some way
692063 im fired up to go i cant wait to salute our athletes and i cant wait to share in the joy of your triumphs
692064 well the fbis been here for about a year we knew that they have been here for a long time i would see them all the time so i mean we werent sure exactly what was happening but we knew there was something going on on our street but we never suspected bruce i mean we never you know and i still dont you know look at him unfavorably or anything because he was a really decent guy
692065 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided and i think it should be soon
692066 so the novelistic tension of the 2008 race is this can obama overcome his pride and hyde park hauteur and win america over
692067 can miss bennet teach mr darcy to let down his guard be more sportive and laugh at himself
692068 now why did i like this movie it was just plain dumb fun is why it is absurd and preposterous and proud of it

692085 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
692086 we started really well and finished really well last season
692087 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season

692094 the only main character is a drawn version of the author sitting behind his laptop and on the phone all supporting characters are expressed through dialogue usually as a voice on the phone the tone of the webcomic is comedic satirical and ironic

692104 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
692105 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
692106 the entirety of obamas position is making sure our tires are inflated
692107 we want you to wear sunscreen you know it will very mildly improve your chances of not getting sick but wearing sunscreen is not a healthcare policy for the united states of america

692125 i say steady look what were coming to for now they saw before them the caldron pool and beyond the pool the high unclimbable cliffs and pouring down the cliffs thousands of tons of water every second flashing like diamonds in some places and dark glassy green in others the great waterfall and already the thunder of it was in their ears dont stop further up and further in this is absolutely crazy
692126 have you noticed one cant feel afraid even it one wants to try it but before jill had time to notice all things fully she was going up the waterfall herself it was the sort of thing that would have been quite impossible in our world even if you hadnt been drowned you would have been smashed to pieces by the terrible weight of water against countless jags of rock but in that world you could do it you went on up and up with all kinds of reflected lights flashing at you from the water and all manner of coloured stones flashing through it till it seemed as if you were climbing up light itself and always higher and higher till the sense of height would have terrified you if you could be terrified but here it was gloriously exciting and then at last one came to the lovely smooth green curve in which the water poured over the top and found that one was out on the level river above the waterfall the current was racing away behind you but you were such a wonderful swimmer that you could make headway against it soon they were all on the bank dripping but happy further up and further in

692178 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
692179 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
692180 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
692181 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
692182 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
692183 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
692184 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
692185 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
692186 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
692187 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
692188 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
692189 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
692190 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
692191 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
692192 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
692193 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
692194 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
692195 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
692196 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
692197 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
692198 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
692199 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
692200 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
692201 who are open to doing something on the production side
692202 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
692203 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
692204 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
692205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
692206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
692207 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
692208 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
692209 if only more woman thought like this rather than always whinning moaning taking their money and not letting them see their kids
692210 i was brought up in england in the 70s had a female arkela female primary and secondary teachers and got the hell out of the place as soon as i could i have lived in spain for 18 years where i have slowly allowed recoverd from the damage my warped education inflicted
692211 women would never have invented the car tv or the computer the womens weekly mags showing stars canoodling is the cosmic shrine of all women what did nicole do what did brad do these are perennially the most important things in womens lives
692212 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
692213 reveals that may low wage workers in the united states are struggling to pay for their essential needs such as housing food and health care
692214 the gap between the lowest and highest us wages has widened as it never has since the 1920s
692215 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
692216 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
692217 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
692218 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
692219 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
692220 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
692221 i am prepared to break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
692222 we do pray for her family a close knit family
692223 we are turning over all the stones to find the person responsible
692224 i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first its to work hard to win a championship year after year and second to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community
692225 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
692226 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
692227 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
692228 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
692229 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
692230 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
692231 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
692232 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
692233 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
692234 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
692235 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
692236 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
692237 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
692238 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
692239 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
692240 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
692241 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
692242 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
692243 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
692244 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
692245 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
692246 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
692247 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
692248 there has been increasing concern about the exposure of children to the obscene and pornographic materials via the internet
692249 if an adult wishes to have unrestricted access to the internet service maybe obtained from an internet service provider in password protected manner making a payment
692250 however the user is responsible for use of the service in proper manner and should ensure that the filtered websites are not accessible to the children
692251 at present though the rates have admittedly been coming down over the years nevertheless the call charges within the region remain somewhat costly
692252 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
692253 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
692254 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
692255 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
692256 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
692257 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
692258 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
692259 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
692260 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
692261 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
692262 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
692263 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
692264 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
692265 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
692266 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
692267 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
692268 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
692269 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
692270 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
692271 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
692272 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
692273 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
692274 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
692275 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
692276 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
692277 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
692278 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
692279 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
692280 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
692281 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
692282 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

692318 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
692319 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

692326 i would never say that republicans are inherently racist or obsessed with racism as a tactic frankly such an approach wouldnt make sense as an all purpose strategy i do think that in certain races under certain circumstances that race has been used
692327 from everything i have seen the gop is obsessively concerned with
692328 i do think that in certain races under certain circumstances that race has been used
692329 obama doesnt really benefit from discussions of race no matter who brings it up there are people who will vote against him because of it and flinging the race card only helps him with people hes getting anyway
692330 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try and hold it if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
692331 and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increaslingly heavy you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again when were refreshed we can carry on with the burden
692332 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work down whatever burdens youre carrying now let them down for a moment if you can

692339 das war mit sicherheit eines meiner h rtesten rennen wir waren nur drei piloten mussten deshalb sehr viele doppelstints fahren die nat rlich ungemein an die substanz gehen

692343 i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
692344 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
692345 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
692346 we did a survey of a quarter of the properties and you could count on one hand the number that have actually been remediated
692347 this was the only gesture the administration has made toward peoples immediate needs and its as demoralizing as can be
692348 es gab in diesem jahr bereits einige rennen in denen ich in der lage war um den sieg zu k mpfen und in denen ich dann pech hatte
692349 nach der h lfte des heutigen grand prix begann sich das blatt f r mich zu wenden ich attackierte felipe massa nach kr ften und es funktionierte es tut mir leid f r ihn denn er fuhr ein gutes rennen
692350 zu beginn hatte ich schon probleme mit den reifen aber der plattfu hatte sich nicht angek ndigt pl tzlich wurde das auto in kurve eins auf der linken seite instabil und ich dachte schon ich h tte einen fehler gemacht
692351 in der zweiten kurve habe ich dann begriffen was passiert war mit unserer strategie rechnete ich mir immer noch eine siegchance aus doch der reifenschaden zerst rte mein rennen
692352 leider sollte das nicht sein durch einen bremsplatten und einen unabh ngig davon aufgetretenen reifenschaden verlor er seine siegchance
692353 i would like to buy a new cell phone but i am really confused which one should i go for

692357 ive met with kanye and ive talked to other artists about how potentially to bridge that gap i think the potential for them to deliver a message of extraordinary power that gets people thinking is massive
692358 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
692359 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
692360 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
692361 he has promised he would veto every bill that has them barack obama has voted for bills that are laden with pork whether its the 2005 bush cheney energy bill the 2008 agricultural subsidy bill both of those john mccain voted against because they were laden with pork both of those barack obama voted for
692362 john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes particularly because they impact small businesses and sole proprietorships more greatly than any other part of our economy
692363 his record is very clear on that and he has a number of economists who support his assertion that we can solve the social security and medicare crisis but particularly social security without raising payroll taxes
692364 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely to continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
692365 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
692366 i certainly agree with him that the situation could get worse
692367 and there are a couple of things that will make it worse one is to raise taxes which is what senator obama proposes to do another is to massively increase government spending which is what senator obama would propose to do over 1 5 trillion in increased government spending and the third is to become isolationist and protectionist which senator obama would also propose to do
692368 what senator obama said is that hell have a middle class tax cut and that tax cut will go to roughly 95 percent of all the people whose incomes are under 250 000
692369 for people whose incomes are in excess of 250 000 their income tax rates will go back to the rates we had under president clinton their capital gains rate will go up to some rate less than the rate we had during most of the time president clinton was in office taxes on dividends will go up to the rate that will apply to capital gains and that will be substantially below the rate that was in place when president clinton was elected
692370 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board
692371 on the other hand youre referring to the proposal that came up friday in which offshore drilling was a piece of a much larger piece of legislation
692372 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive
692373 and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy
692374 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

692408 hugs let us know of a update or something thanks
692409 first off let me say that i love guinea pigs and ive had guinea pigs as pets so
692410 for a while we clung to the hope that they had gone to some other town but as time passed that hope faded no words could describe the feeling of helplessness that set in as we watched and waited for the car to return
692411 on different occasions over the years mary sometimes hinted that i should try to write a book but i knew in my heart that it was beyond my capability then in the years after the atrocity in 1998 the fact that i had made no effort to comply with my wifes request sometimes caused me concern about 18 months ago i decided to make an attempt no doubt some readers will frown at my endeavour but i like to think that somewhere beyond the great divide there is one who smiles
692412 the book takes in from the day i went to school in 1932 through the story of my farming life as i lived it
692413 about 75 of the book is about country life before it finishes with that day in august 10 years ago in the last 10 years i never got involved in any of the groups that were looking for justice on 15 august there will be a commemoration in omagh and i will have to attend but i am not looking forward to it
692414 i call them poems but maybe the professionals would not call them that there are over 25 poems in the book and i just like them to rhyme as well as they can
692415 the human race needs to improve its mental and physical qualities if it is to deal with the increasingly complex world around it and meet new challenges like space travel and it also needs to increase its complexity if biological systems are to keep ahead of electronic ones
692416 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
692417 it was determined that he as obviously intoxicated based on his objective symptoms of intoxicated that included his slurred speech strong odor of an alcoholic beverage blood shot and watery eyes as well as statements made by the suspect to the officers
692418 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
692419 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
692420 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
692421 we may not have put an end to all our problems
692422 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
692423 well im glad all that time away from home was worth it
692424 the universe is made of one substance this is known in some circles as life force this means there is only one type of energy all manifestations including the various observed energy forms such as electricity magnetism and chemical energy etc are projections of programs powered and run by this one type of energy the human system can be seen as a program with an energy input and energy output when the rate of energy output exceeds the rate of energy input over a given time period then the conditions of ageing illness and death result alternatively when the rate of energy input exceeds the rate of energy output then growth evolution and immortality become possible
692425 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
692426 my job is not to make profits larger although i care about a healthy oil industry
692427 when people say this will have only a nominal impact on prices thats saying we dont have to do anything at all
692428 the people in the observatory office down in santa cruz had me leave my car at a place on the edge of silicon valley where i met up with some other people and we all took a little bus up the mountain
692429 everybody was talking about a fire north of the observatory
692430 its like a town up there about a mile from one end to the other and all the buildings are on tops of peaks
692431 i could see fire trucks where most of the smoke was just down the hill from me so it was either walk back down the main road to the buildings way back or try to get the firefighters to tell me where everybody was
692432 when i started hiking down i lost sight of the trucks and i couldnt get reoriented because of the smoke
692433 i finally saw some guys and they saw me and they motioned for me to come to where they were i wasnt completely sure i could jump over the line of flames without catching on fire but it was really small and i didnt want to go back the way i came and find myself in a worse situation
692434 after i jumped over and got to where they were they said i should have waited until they could shovel some dirt onto the fire right where i was
692435 i wiped my forehead and realised i was totally black i felt some sweat near my eye but i didnt try to wipe it away
692436 after that the only thing i heard anybody say was get him outta here
692437 its all wilderness back there until you get to i 5 like modesto
692438 this bunkhouse they took me to was like a vacation
692439 you havent always worked by spending a lot of time with raw recordings and working them down to things you do live
692440 but weve been passing audio stuff around for a long time and somebodys always making video with crude audio
692441 way back bobby gave me a video of some stuff he did with nina and the sound was good her own stuff i overdubbed some harmony like a total straight duet not trading off on the lyrics surprised her with a copy and we did that back and forth for a while
692442 the first time jack saw nina she had two heads
692443 there was this problem class a class i was putting off showing up for i came in just before it ended and sat in the back til the bell and after everybodys out went up to the front and asked for the reading list the teacher says to get it from somebody in the class
692444 which is no big problem because nina is in the class but we havent actually met yet or i could have saved myself the trouble
692445 uh i think you may have wanted to meet the teacher
692446 they dont do much about attendance except grade us down for each day you miss
692447 id missed every day til that first friday four days
692448 mostly sitting in michaels van down the street working out music
692449 yeah one more day and i take a fail cant make it up until next semester so it was time to try to just get the reading list
692450 so the teacher glances over my shoulder at somebody behind me
692451 kastanis this boy needs a copy of the reading list is he worth a few minutes of your time
692452 so i turn around before the teachers done talking ive been face to face with nina who still has no idea its me
692453 id forgotten my scarf i dont like to go outside without my hair tied up
692454 im thinking this is some guy from my old school who i dont remember but he sure remembers me and he looks like he just got up the courage to tell me that hes in love with me
692455 then jacks into his host mode and he invited me to a jam with him and bobby and some others which i had never done before jam that is or ever wanted to so i said
692456 band camp early summer i started working with bobby right away because he can play anything
692457 jack he dont play no school music mistuh mo gan stern
692458 up until that point jack is just this interesting guy who is going to get badly profiled by people who watch too much tv
692459 this doesnt sound like high school i didnt see reading list handouts until i was in college and i went to a fairly upscale high school
692460 its still part of the warehousing give any seemingly bright kids a chance to self select as they say even if the school doesnt have the wherewithal or the resources what does it take to make a list and hope well go to the library and read some crusty standards the teachers can live with that and the admins have covered their asses think how easy the lesson plan is first week read write second week read write
692461 so most of the class just shows up and waits it out
692462 its not like theyre telling us to be unproductive they just cant imagine any way to make things relevant so they just hope something will click sometimes it does as usual they dont make much effort to find out where we might have some untapped energy the energy they see makes em nervous of course
692463 most people dont realize that there are clues in the crusty standards like shakespeare in romeo and juliet saying that even after the boy and girl are dead the adults dont get it
692464 maybe theyre standards because they have things that keep them bouncing back from un cool
692465 tell me youve never seen a couple of people do this
692466 well we wont blame jack if the audience doesnt get it how about the others bobby
692467 i just wanted to see the place and assumed there would be people around
692468 nobodys working either went home or theyre in the cafe somebodys doing a thing with music and you know
692469 i have time im not doing anything specific what are you working on
692470 they wont be around maybe later on tonight we can have something to eat always something to fry all together or microwave lots of stuff to drink
692471 i dont really do any art stuff just the music
692472 and musicians work at a desk a lot these days
692473 not an artist not a musician who are you today
692474 i thought about re rendering it all in carbon fiber
692475 its an emulation of an interurban electric streetcar system from the 1890s down around san diego two actually they would lay tracks out of town the way they figured the development would go lots of politics and sometimes they would meet up with the same thing coming from the other direction during the real estate booms you could ride out to the sticks and buy a lot come back later as the house was built think about whether you wanted to do business out there start a town why l a has so many little areas that have names
692476 wouldnt work or maybe way up in the north part of the state the way it is now
692477 the right of ways in and around most cities are all totally developed right up to the tracks therere some huge light rail systems on all that huge infrastructure vehicle weight to carrying capacity ratios as bad an suv worse especially in san diego here in sacto bart over in the bay area has nice views when its not underground huge infrastructure all of em stations with parking lots you still gotta have a car and when they get into the downtown its just one line no grid bus transfers schedules weird bus routes that are supposed to be cost effective hours to get from one part of the sprawl to another job security for rapid transit bureaucrats and washington lobbyists pork
692478 but theyre not the real problem the only sustainable cost effective system has to have all the best things about cars and all the best things about trains
692479 do you have anything where you can you show me what you mean
692480 transportation hasnt evolved to any where near the current level of communications and manufacturing technology you can talk to anybody about anything any time synchronous or asynchronous as you want but weve made it almost stupid to try to go where they are and meet them youre not going to drop in on ten or twelve people in a day where theyre doing what they do were everywhere and nowhere today youll be here at my parents house the art extension and home or wherever with a lot of lag time that you use to plan an effective itinerary for the next day and so on mom dad and the kids have to do heavy logistics on mostly dull duties lots of trucks that define what it is they carry what we consume based on the way trucks work table without detachable legs forget it drivers never see anything but traffic and loading docks unless theyre doing packages out in the burbs the lucky ones if you like that kind of stress this aint livin
692481 ill show you how the street tracks work when i get the presentation running
692482 nobody but my friends understands the connection to real music
692483 they either only understand the kind of noise i make or they only understand real music they dont know what theyre missing
692484 where people could just take all the tools in their garage and not even care if they were lost or broken or stolen because if everybody did that nobody would have to keep track of any of it but thered be such a huge supply you could always get whatever tool you needed once every year or two
692485 that i have a drill and i dont want to i just want to have immediate access to one about every two years without having to bother with anybody about who owns it everybody can have all the stuff in my garage if i can use it every once in a while no questions asked well get you a little warehouse and you can hang out there all day not worrying about exactly whats where or why and you can talk tools with anybody who has nothing better to do
692486 we just get everybody to empty their garage we can start with mine theres a couple of rooms we could empty too start another place full of home electronics that have been orphaned by the latest gadget kitchen things that we never cook with but that somebody else might or that we might realize we could use a year and a half later
692487 now you go to a thrift store and tell me if theres anything there you want to use its there because its useless or probably doesnt work
692488 everything at my house works i just dont want it around
692489 and have to buy one when i need it next year
692490 if youre going to need it why dont you just keep it
692491 excluding of course the one time that he never made it back
692492 ankle doesnt hurt unless i move it chair any chance
692493 if i could just get a chair one from the back
692494 sure ill get you one i can get to the back through there
692495 i came up to look for the truck with something i ordered
692496 thats what i was going to do i must have stepped down wrong coming out the front door
692497 i have know way of knowing im sure it wasnt more than a couple of hours
692498 no no i didnt mind a bit it was nice you come back tomorrow and youll find me sitting right here
692499 if you can hobble out here with a cast on your foot
692500 i dont think that will be a big deal if i have to sit this is where i want to
692501 its someplace to go why be at home by yourself watching the world go on without you when you can watch that from here with us and have people to talk to about it or whatever who knows where that might lead
692502 we dont have any designs on your soul or your hairstyle
692503 i wish we could be doing this where there was a little more traffic more kinds of things going by
692504 you just need to get about two hundred more people out here spread out on all four corners
692505 its hideous no one will be willing to buy it and it scares the family to even look at it
692506 but our son likes to play with it and he stopped us from getting rid of it he even feeds it milk
692507 america loves a shapely woman and dont you forget it
692508 its my new musical mouse since i decided to replace elmo the kids were getting bored because they were gett

692510 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
692511 when we are in san diego we might see each other
692512 wouldnt it be funny if we bumped in to each other in san diego but it still sounds lame doesnt it i really need to learn how to talk
692513 attested to you by god with miracles and wonders and signs which god performed through him in your midst just as you yourselves know
692514 do not even endeavor by reflection and study to turn into what may deserve the name of knowledge and rational conviction the opinions which in their childhood they had taken on trust
692515 why is it that we see so much focus on whether or not the new atheists are
692516 sensing opposition within the communist party leadership stalin used the december 1934 assassination of his heir apparent sergei kirov probably not arranged by stalin himself as once thought as the excuse to launch the great purge of 1936 1938
692517 stalin took the victory of 1945 as vindication of his command economy and intensified his dictatorial control instead of relaxing it as his subjects had hoped he continued to conduct purges particularly against ethnic minorities foreign influences and jewish cultural figures possible further purges were cut short by his death of a stroke on 5 march 1953
692518 by most accounts stalin was a man of extraordinary evil adept at behind the scenes intrigue he was implacably vindictive toward anyone who had ever disagreed with him or outshone him save lenin foreign leaders and diplomats who dealt with stalin found him personally charming as well as shrewd though he enjoyed humiliating his own loyal entourage in retrospect his paranoid tendencies are clear but this is an occupational disease of dictators
692519 stalins model of government and economy was copied in china north korea north vietnam and cuba

692532 wenn die belegschaften des vw konzerns diesen vertrag k ndigen wollen dann geht dies nur wenn auch die arbeitnehmervertreter von porsche zustimmen 11 400 porsche besch ftigte haben dann die m glichkeit den willen von 360 000 vw besch ftigten zu unterdr cken eine solche regelung steht dem demokratieprinzip der deutschen mitbestimmung und unserer sozialen marktwirtschaft zutiefst entgegen

692535 die stimmungs und fr hindikatoren signalisieren eine abrupte abschw chung der wachstumsdynamik
692536 bei einer teuerung um 4 0 prozent z hlt das wachstum in der reaktionsfunktion der ezb nicht
692537 bei einer so niedrigen arbeitslosenrate und hohen kapazit tsauslastung ist ein abschwung n tig um mittelfristig preisstabilit t zu erreichen deshalb wird die ezb anders als im abschwung 2001 bis 2003 als sie half und eine rezession verhinderte nicht in eile sein zu senken

692539 i feel like this album is a really strong progression from the last album
692540 i had a chance to focus on the basics of song writing rather than just making a lot of noise of course the album is still makes a lot of noise but i feel like the songwriting has gone to the next level

692548 local distribution patterns could change too stephen gaddis chief executive of pacific cheese co a hayward calif cheese processing and packaging firm thinks high fuel prices will push restaurants retailers and food manufacturers to look for suppliers closer to their operations local sourcing is ideal you wont pay as much for freight and when you use less fuel its better for the environment gaddis said soaring diesel prices will make companies rethink whether they should have large centralized plants or build smaller ones around the country thats what pacific cheese is doing its building a packaging plant in texas to be closer to one of its larger suppliers and expects to serve its southwestern clients from there in the near future however consumers can expect to pay for the higher cost of producing food and moving it around the country say food executives farmers and economists even having a deep dish pizza with extra cheese brought to your door costs more now that chains such as pizza hut are charging for delivery
692549 when people talk about an eco house they picture a sleek house in the countryside with solar panels and wind turbines well good for them but thats not how the average person lives

692553 soaring transportation costs also have an impact on food from bananas to salmon higher shipping rates could eventually transform some items now found in the typical middle class pantry into luxuries and further promote the so called local food movement popular in many american and european cities

692559 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour

692561 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
692562 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
692563 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year
692564 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
692565 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
692566 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
692567 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party
692568 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
692569 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong

692572 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
692573 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
692574 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
692575 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
692576 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
692577 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
692578 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
692579 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
692580 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
692581 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
692582 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
692583 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
692584 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
692585 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
692586 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
692587 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
692588 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
692589 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
692590 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
692591 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
692592 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
692593 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
692594 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
692595 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
692596 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
692597 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
692598 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
692599 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
692600 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
692601 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
692602 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
692603 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
692604 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
692605 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
692606 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
692607 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
692608 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
692609 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
692610 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
692611 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
692612 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
692613 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
692614 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
692615 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
692616 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
692617 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
692618 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
692619 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
692620 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
692621 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
692622 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
692623 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
692624 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
692625 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it

692630 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
692631 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important

692641 acorn chose to treat the embezzlement of nearly 1 million eight years ago as an internal matter and did not even notify its board a whistle blower forced acorn to disclose the embezzlement which involved the brother of the organizations founder wade rathke dale rathke remained on acorns payroll until a month ago when disclosure of his theft by foundations and other donors forced the organization to dismiss him
692642 clearly one other possible explanation is that hillary is off sulking or busy raising money to pay off debts and just lied about helping obama
692643 the only explanation that makes sense in terms of a realistic assessment of the parties past actions and behaviors rather than hope bong induced delusions is that obama has not asked the clintons to campaign for him
692644 t he candidates wife made it clear she was here to court the new supporters
692645 he would not accept accept a vice presidential offer from obama by lisab at no quarter

692647 herbert 7 28 08 ill say this about senator obama
692648 it was one of those rare newshour moments when you could tell something had gone wrong with this normally polite and even handed program just by observing the facial expressions of barack obama adviser lawrence korb in particular and moderator margaret warner at the end of it
692649 was allowed to attack and distort mr obamas position and then allowed to continue his argument
692650 abrams 7 28 08 a new nonpartisan study finds that the press is right tougher on barack obama than on john mccain
692651 cox 7 28 08 the authors of the study admit that most on air statements during that time could not be classified as positive or negative and that in fact found less than two opinion statements per night on the candidates on all three networks combined
692652 i have a job to do and i always tell young people do the job thats in front of you

692664 the decision to close followed the direction of our clients the editors of our papers
692665 they felt they could not afford to pay for a central washington bureau at a time when they were steering all available resources to local coverage back at home
692666 we have a whole generation thats trained to expect to be able to voice their opinion not just to read the news but to talk about it or share it and that may be ugly or it may be really provocative but i want to hear it i really believe if youre a newspaper online and you dont allow this youre not really online youve got to invest in this and really think about it and not just shut off the pipeline
692667 the idea of listening to readers gripe about the newspaper day in and day out still doesnt sound like a dream job nevertheless between the occasional conversations that deteriorated into name calling the past six years of thousands of phone calls and e mails have been fascinating largely because the courant has such devoted readers
692668 for the first time in its history theyre going to have a magazine that is going to make money
692669 when a newspaper is bleeding and you have something that will lift the newspaper immediately why not
692670 had always been produced by the newsroom not a magazine staff magazine people do magazines it takes a very different sensibility to be a magazine editor
692671 we now have 932 members people who have decided to support financially the nonprofit journalism that minnpost com provides
692672 but even thats a long shot considering that the few newspapers on the block arent attracting offers
692673 clintons relatively minimal public campaign role to date has been noticeable
692674 todays news makes that job of balancing the budget harder but should not change our resolve to make the tough decisions and the genuine effort to reach across the aisle
692675 40 bills that have in many cases been single handedly stalled by one of the senates more conservative members

692696 im unhappy with the current presidential race so much so that i havent endorsed obama or hillary clinton though im well known to be a democrat

692765 its beautifully crafted propaganda and its a huge problem for us

692771 the presence of the border had some interesting impacts on english politics for example because the most combat experienced forces were under the control of the border nobles these nobles would find themselves being the critical party in major battles especially during the interminable war of the roses
692772 in local government a long term effect of the fall of the black douglases slowly became apparent such was the grip of the earls on the borders and galloway and so great were their resources that they were able to to keep order amongst the lesser nobility but when their leadership was removed virtually overnight a patchwork of names small lordships old resentements and budding ambitions replaced it kers pringles humes scotts johnstones maxwells and others emerged and began to compete squabble and eventually feud with each other in the power vacuum left by the depart of the douglases
692773 asked about the biggest threat to their groups survival a militant says that

692781 islamists in the wilderness must create parallel societies alongside existing ones

692783 hopefully this event the iranian test firing of intermediate rang missiles it will serve as a catalyst that will finally gel all of the different factors that have been out there that will allow us then to act with our friends and allies in a most effective fashion and modify iranian behavior but we cannot allow a second holocaust
692784 israeli intelligence and security officials have revised their estimates of how long it will take iran to develop a nuclear weapons capability the previous estimate of 5 7 years has been changed to 2 3 years
692785 intelligence sources say that iran has crossed the point of no return in the acquisition of nuclear weapons
692786 israeli defence minister ben eliezer says iran could have a nuclear weapon by 2005
692787 an israeli spokesman says that a western led coalition will begin a strike to prevent iran acquiring nuclear capability the attack will be on a secret nuclear installatioin in neka 100km north east of teheran
692788 iran has the potential to procure nuclear weapons within four years
692789 hey weve got a missile that can reach israel now
692790 iran cooperates with that isolation in some areas iran does not like the idea of ayatollah sistani and the hawza of najaf swaying their youth to more traditional shia beliefs
692791 theres a reason that sistani is as at risk for assassination and it isnt entirely because of radical sunni hit squads its pretty obvious based on large things and small that iran is not trying to ingratiate itself with anybody and bites any outside hand that gets too close to them
692792 theyll late pay their outside oil partners or stiff them entirely
692793 they fairly famously shot up a romanian oil platform when they tried to leave iranian waters after the iranians stopped paying for the rig this is not how you win friends and influence people except to stay the hell away from you
692794 and yes i have no doubt that iran can gin up a major western media conniption at will inside knowledge like that is not illegal to have and trading on it is a pretty good guaranteed bet
692795 does iran act like a country thats got lots of cash
692796 if iran could maintain the gasoline subsidy the ahmadinejad government is the one who would have tried
692797 if you could kindly give me a link showing me that there is a legal unsubsidized petrol market in the iri then youd be right it is a blind alley
692798 were there a two tier tax structure as the uks red white diesel scheme one could simply fiddle with who could get subsidized fuel and the rich would pay more
692799 iran did not do that and ive never seen any announcement that theyve made such adjustments in the past
692800 you do seem to like to throw around red herrings though paul bremers completely irrelevant
692801 as to the romanian incident the iranians seemed to believe much as theyve attempted at bushehr that ones partners are obliged to continue working even when you stop paying
692802 that was the nature of the commercial dispute unlike the russians who simply fly out their technicians when they want their money the romanians were operating under the disadvantage that oil platforms cannot simply be abandoned at sea
692803 people tend not to want to deal with you when this sort of thing happens but iran does this and not just with romanian companies headed by who knows who
692804 if theyve got money which you assert they have and they have huge problems with oil depletion which the worlds geologist universally assert then this sort of payments problem should simply not exist
692805 but they do and with high profile bet the nation initiatives like oil drilling and the bushehr nuclear power station you can wave away the oil rig and frankly if this was the only incident youd have a leg to stand on but you cant wave away the missed payments to the russians over bushehr and the major slippages in schedule that this has caused
692806 furthermore its arguable that total sa meant irans missile tests when it said the conditions were not right to invest in iran
692807 but hey the total pullout doesnt matter much because iran is swimming in cash and doesnt actually need outside investment says you
692808 as for the missile photos the fakery of the photo and the shahab 3 fake are two different falsehoods youre combining them and trying to cast doubt on your own creation straw man much
692809 your final red herring is about israelis playing the commodities market who said that israel couldnt play the same game
692810 but lets be serious here cui bono irans national fisc benefits when prices go up so its possible a short term oriented government might play that game
692811 israels national fisc gets hammered so beneficiaries would have to be private actors whose interest is separate from their government and who dont care thats quite a different dynamic so this one even fails as a red herring
692812 as for sistani the bottom line is that hes a religious leader whos publicly and repeatedly said that the iris regime is based on a heresy and hes got the education and the influence to make that opinion matter
692813 iran doesnt dare kill him because hes that revered but they get along with him
692814 with military bases and forces around iran america has access to the entire territory of the country the islamic republic of iran is a political regime that relies upon the iranian people if the enemy aims to change the regime it can achieve this by disrupting the regimes ability to administer the population to this end the enemy will attempt to paralyze infrastructures and the vital institutions of the regime in order to sow dissatisfaction among the people
692815 that is the enemy will try to destroy the infrastructures vital to peoples lives and we must protect the people while providing necessary services according to some analyses the 2006 lebanon war was a war of bridges because israel destroyed all bridges in lebanon large and small in order to cut off all land routes in other words in that war the immediate aim was to destroy the infrastructures that permit administering the population but the ultimate aim was to render such administration impossible
692816 i think all of this makes a very good case for my own assessment due to these pressures upon shia regime in iran and the terror they are fearing from possible regime change it will be the iranians who will launch the preemptive strike
692817 it will be against israel albeit via hezbollah and syria and it most likely will involve wmd
692818 iran would not dare close the strait of hormuz it is the main artery providing the lifeblood of the regime
692819 its closure would due more to cause popular unrest and insurrection in iran
692820 than we would have to fear from exocets c801 802 missiles or swarming small watercraft attacks and short term economic impact
692821 no the strait of hormuz will not be closed for any significant length of time if at all imho
692822 this war will not be focused on iran not yet this war will initially be focused in the levant between the bekaa damascus tel aviv and jerusalem
692823 it has modern ada equipment and doctrine and many layers of forces to assist in the defense and recovery of any facility
692824 iranian mini submarines december 12 2005 iran apparently with technical help from north korea is now building mini submarines for operations along its coasts and throughout the persian gulf two have been built so far the sub has a two man crew and can carry three divers or several naval mines or a torpedo the iranians say they will use the mini subs to lay mines or launch underwater commando attacks while the north koreans provided some technical assistance the iranian sub is a local design smaller than most north korean mini subs which is a reflection of the more turbulent seas found off the korean coast in the shallow waters of the persian gulf the iranian minisubs which look like an enlarged torpedo with a glassed over cockpit in the front can be very difficult to detect their range is probably a few hundred kilometers more than sufficient to reach any targets in the area however the united states navy has spent a lot of time and effort on the problem and is probably better prepared to deal with minisubs than most navies north korea has a fleet of over 60 mini subs and apparently iran wants at least a few dozen
692825 last august i was on a flight from dubai to frankfurt and from my window seat i got a good look at the straights it basically looked like a 2 lane highway with bumper to bumper traffic with the iranian side being the high ground
692826 her conclusion is that iran wont be able to fully close the strait but it doesnt need to in order to cause significant and serious economic consequences
692827 israel is threatening to attack irans nuclear sites this may not be a bluff
692828 the war in iraq has proven to be a proving ground for the strategies and tactics of 21st century warfare much like the spanish civil war was for ww2 unfortunately the bulk of the improvement has been in how small groups of guerrillas terrorists can defeat a nation state

692831 the neurosurgeon just spoke with us he seems to think judging from the mri that the tumor is localized meaning it didnt come from somewhere else in his body he also thinks its a very slow growing tumor he told us that the more we wait for the swelling to go down and the less seizing he has the more successful an operation would be he also said that since the tumor is located in the right hemisphere there is less of a chance that his speech would be affected by surgery hes going to meet with us again tomorrow afternoon to discuss the next plan of action right now we have to just wait and try to keep my dad comfortable we really appreciate your prayers and support but we ask that only family would visit the hospital we simply cant manage it and my dad is not at the right point in time to have non family visitors thanks

692834 the subprime crisis is just the tip of the iceberg fundamental changes in american life may turn todays mcmansions into tomorrows tenements
692835 the decline of places like windy ridge and franklin reserve is usually attributed to the subprime mortgage crisis with its wave of foreclosures and the crisis has indeed catalyzed or intensified social problems in many communities but the story of vacant suburban homes and declining suburban neighborhoods did not begin with the crisis and will not end with it a structural change is under way in the housing market a major shift in the way many americans want to live and work it has shaped the current downturn steering some of the worst problems away from the cities and toward the suburban fringes and its effects will be felt more strongly and more broadly as the years pass its ultimate impact on the suburbs and the cities will be profound
692836 for 60 years americans have pushed steadily into the suburbs transforming the landscape and until recently leaving cities behind but today the pendulum is swinging back toward urban living and there are many reasons to believe this swing will continue as it does many low density suburbs and mcmansion subdivisions including some that are lovely and affluent today may become what inner cities became in the 1960s and 70s slums characterized by poverty crime and decay

692844 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water

692850 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
692851 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
692852 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
692853 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
692854 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
692855 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
692856 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
692857 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him

692860 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
692861 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
692862 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
692863 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
692864 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
692865 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
692866 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me
692867 halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked
692868 i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
692869 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
692870 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
692871 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
692872 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
692873 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
692874 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
692875 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

692920 this chorus will grow for a number of reasons but mostly because its message is the most sensible and the alternatives are too damning the current path leads to energy poverty and failure americans are exasperated with the effects of congress energy policy incompetence petroleum prices are climbing rogue states arent becoming any less troublesome and this country and her energy needs are only growing
692921 but consider that with new off shore drilling technology even hurricane katrinas major wallop was unable to cause oil spills from any of the numerous drilling platforms operating in the gulf of mexico as a result of the environmental lobbys years of influence in the nations capitol two thirds of the oil used today in the united states is imported from countries such as saudi arabia nigeria venezuela iraq algeria angola and russia
692922 generally speaking western companies use the latest technology to reduce waste and maximize oil field output but with corrupt leaders bleeding money from state oil coffers cash that might have been invested in better equipment the national firms tend to extract less oil from the ground and expend far more energy doing so despite vast deposits oil field production has been dropping in mexico iran and venezuela

692931 i am with the israelis and dont know what will be decided yet but as far as we are concerned we are headed to the strip
692932 i think its great that theyre allowed to fly it
692933 there is a subculture within the white southern population of which the scv is the most visible voice that feels besieged by modern culture in general and they identify the old south and confederacy as a way of life and a period of time before the siege began to really hit the south
692934 we have indian hispanic black and white members of our camps and if anyone espouses anything hateful or racewise youre gone from the scv
692935 i consider myself a southern gentleman but i just feel bringing this up now it represents a painful and a hurtful time and i dont think its necessary to hurt people to make a point
692936 i think this is very likely to come back to bite them in the behind
692937 i dont think seeing some gigantic confederate flag convinces anyone that the civil war was not about slavery and that the antebellum south was really a wonderful place where everybody got along

693049 live online chat where people can submit their 2 cents worth this article is a chronicle of the experiences of a filipina teacher who was recruited by the prince georges county school system to teach in american public schools in prince georges the starting teachers salary is 43 481 almost 10 times what the same teacher would make in the philippines many filipinos like mabel can make much more here because of their years of experience salaries for someone with two decades of experience and a masters degree can be more than 80 000 perhaps most important the teachers get a shot at becoming americans if they perform well for three years the county will sponsor them for a green card or permanent residency it can take years for them to actually get the card and later citizenship because of the government backlog but theirs is a much easier path to the united states than that of many other immigrants they dont have to come here illegally or win a visa lottery they just have to do their jobs graduates job hunts majorly frustrating

693055 thatcher should only be allowed a state funeral if the contract is put out to compulsory competitive tender and awarded to the lowest bidder any offers
693056 but she wouldnt want a state funeral that would just be paying people to dig a hole and fill it in again
693057 hes a very intelligent man and he has a lot of interesting ideas
693058 hes basically being blamed for every bicycle that has disappeared over many many years in toronto
693059 he just has a very unique way of looking at things
693060 he was a good employer even though he could be demanding at times
693061 i find it very hard to believe what people are saying about him
693062 i cannot believe that he would tell someone to steal a bike
693063 he was just very unapproachable and almost condescending to people who would ask questions
693064 ive had no issues no skin issues any issues whatsoever so if i can do it anybody can do it
693065 i live around here and i want to enjoy the swims again
693066 no i enjoyed it its great and i cant wait to do it again
693067 this is where we had one of our very first dates when it was lifeguarded
693068 we grew up on the waterfront in dartmouth and as kids we chased rats and stuff like that but i knew one of these days wed be able to swim here again

693076 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
693077 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
693078 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
693079 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
693080 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action
693081 when they get a policy directive they have certain room for manoeuvre keeping the interests of the state in view
693082 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
693083 the clients have their own agenda and room for manoeuvre its a very very murky relationship and the attacks in pakistan show that many operators have gone rogue
693084 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organization on pakistani soil
693085 but the general assumption in washington is that a mixed and unreliable ally is better than no ally at all
693086 what would trigger consolidation is earnings comfort earnings are generally weaker than expected particularly the second quarter versus last year because of the high base effect of 2007 which was an election year where consumption was high and inflation and interest rates were low aside from that earnings were negatively affected by inflation in the second quarter

693088 collection of the claim of approximately p10 2 billion from pra is the corporations foremost plan the continuation of its operations primarily depends on payment of this claim
693089 considering that the pra has acknowledged the claim and merely requested for time to further evaluate the claim and the supporting documents the corporation submitted the corporation shall continue pursuing the collection of the claim

693108 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
693109 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board

693115 it has not evaded the difficult questions even if it hasnt answered them in the way that some people would have liked
693116 here my dear sisters and brothers is an insight of what the church is called to be an inclusive communion where there is space equally for everyone and anyone regardless of colour gender ability sexual orientation
693117 unity in diversity is a cherished anglican tradition a spirituality if you like which we must reinforce in all humility for the sake of christ and christs gospel
693118 the anglican communion must speak on their behalf whether it is the crisis in sri lanka
693119 the voiceless must be given a voice through the leadership of the anglican communion
693120 the second strand that goes with a voice for the voiceless is the calling into accountability of those who abuse power authoritarian regimes who oppress and suppress the people
693121 we need to get beyond the reciprocal impatience that shows itself in the ways in which both liberals and traditionalists are ready almost eager at times it appears to assume that the other is not actually listening to jesus
693122 we also know that how we think about that unity is itself affected by the urgency of the calls on our compassion and imagination some sorts of division undoubtedly will seem a luxury in the face of certain challenges as many christians in germany found when confronted by hitler we have to think and pray hard about what the essentials really are
693123 there should be a backlash against this fundamentalism that has been thrust upon us
693124 it is contrary to the ministry of jesus and damaging that in the church were still fighting battles that have already been won in society
693125 preece told me how frustrating howard had found life in cross plains texas how he could never get very far away because he supported his parents by his writing and because his mother had kept him too closely tied to her apron strings
693126 and without doubt howard was a psychological case study howard suffered from delusions of persecution and his end constituted a classic case of oedipus complex
693127 although a big powerful man like his heroes he suffered delusions of persecution and killed himself in an excess of emotion over his aged mothers death
693128 he dwelt with two aged aunts seldom ventured abroad save at night and indulged in many obsessions and affectations
693129 the kind of lord than many people would like to be if they had the chance he was 6 4 tall and a sportsman soldier traveler and a man of letters with a grand gift of poetic speech
693130 any malicious defamation expressed in printing or writing and intended to blacken the memory of one who is dead or the reputation of one who is living and expose him to public hatred contrempt or ridicule is a libel
693131 his personality was introverted unconventional moody and hot tempered given to emotional extremes and violent likes and dislikes
693132 that sleep walking alone indicates a profoundly neurotic personality probably hysteric and hyper suggestible its obvious that here was a fellow who wasnt wired up just right in the matter of sex
693133 we must bear in mind however that posthumous psychoanalysis is at best a jejune form of speculation
693134 it is plain he was not a well balanced human being
693135 together these elements nurtured the violent phantasies of a youthful writer who never learned to cope with reality
693136 much more real to robert howard were the demons and goblins from the depths of hell the strange and evil creatures from other worlds and the hate filled unregenerate humanity the larcenous oil men the prostitutes and the witches who passed as fellow mortals along the streets of cross plains
693137 conversely girls were not likely to be fascinated by robert his repute as the town eccentric his unconventional views and his spells of misanthropy and moroseness made him unattractive to the local girls
693138 whenever de camp encounters some facet of lovecrafts personality that he cannot understand or does not share he immediately undertakes a kind of half baked posthumous psychoanalysis hence refers to lovecrafts sensitivity to place as topomania as if no one could be attached to the physical tokens of his birthplace without being considered neurotic he was out of his depth and this makes his schoolmasterly chiding of lovecraft all the more galling these value judgements were arrived at through inadequate understanding and false perspective
693139 a mature writer however assimilates these influences so that his writings no longer betrays imitation kuttner never reached this stage this fact together with his lavish use of pen names suggests a deeply rooted lack of self confidence

693143 gli investimenti sono stati negli ultimi anni relativamente scarsi rispetto ai profitti in parecchi paesi

693159 to set out boldly in our work is to make a pilgrimage of our labours to understand that the consummation of work lies not in what we have done but who we have become while accomplishing the task

693166 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
693167 the real test is how you act when things dont go according to plan
693168 is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong
693169 they see failure as something they can change the next time around something to learn from and temporary
693170 to date more than 70 of the countrys biggest firms along with several state cpa societies have committed a total of 15 million to the program
693171 the firms will recruit top employees for the program and encourage them to become accounting professors in the audit and tax disciplines
693172 i think that all the speculation is going to come to an end soon because at least were going to get choices before too long
693173 i talked to barack about it this week and you know what he did he just smiled

693175 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mud slingers

693182 we dont want to hire people and then lay them off as done by some airlines
693183 we are moving away from fixed costs to variable costs since january we have frozen fresh recruitment and cut manpower by 30 per cent as we with drew from several sectors
693184 the slowdown in the job market is really happening ites infrastructure industrial manufacturing banking and bpos that were well recruiting last year have taken a hit
693185 i dont know where i was or what i was doing but ill make
693186 if a king arises from the house of david who meditates on the torah occupies himself with the commandments as did his ancestor king david observes the commandments of the written and oral law prevails upon all israel to walk in the way of the torah and to follow its direction and fights the wars of god it may be assumed that he is the messiah if he does these things and is fully successful rebuilds the third temple on its location and gathers the exiled jews he is beyond doubt the messiah but if he is not fully successful or if he is killed he is not the messiah
693187 so you just all of a sudden go the urge to find him
693188 what made you suddenly decide to go into the kitchen
693189 but you just said that samantha had seen him why didnt you just ask her which direction he had gone
693190 because the music was loud and i didnt feel like yelling
693191 but jillian you just got through having a conversation with her why suddenly decide that it was too loud
693192 does it freaking matter why the hell i went into the kitchen
693193 several people saw you go into the kitchen but there are no witnesses to testify what you did in there
693194 if you want to hear it then let me finish
693195 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
693196 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
693197 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
693198 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
693199 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
693200 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
693201 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
693202 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
693203 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
693204 i wouldnt have asked if you hadnt peeked my curiosity
693205 you hear about what happened outside town a couple days ago
693206 well thats me have a great stay at ocheans finest hotel

693210 now jillian tell us what happened one more time from beginning to end and dont leave anything out dont worry about the recorder its just there so we dont have to worry about taking exact notes
693211 well there was a big blow out now im here

693217 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
693218 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
693219 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
693220 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
693221 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
693222 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
693223 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
693224 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
693225 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
693226 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
693227 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
693228 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested

693239 the senate legislation is to require a comprehensive strategy by dod to address sexual assault
693240 also weve put some provisions in that relate specifically to maria lauterbachs case
693241 requirements that the military protective order stay in force until rescinded rather than having the expirations dates that they have right now
693242 that local authorities be notified when the military protective order goes into place so that there is coordination between local authorities and base authorities
693243 were very concerned that the dod not only doesnt take this seriously but isnt going to participate in finding some of the solutions
693244 the committee is talking about what actions they might take against dod to compel them to attend and answer the committees questions and i certainly support that
693245 non posso aiutarti amore sei tutto bagnato e potresti rovinare la mia barca
693246 thank you for all the effort and changes you have made i would remember this day and each day onwards for the rest of my life how appreciative i am of the love and opportunity that you gave yourself myself and us to happen i will appreciate you i will take your worries away im all yours
693247 its just a girl and all the things she put you up with is it worth it what you like about her
693248 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
693249 whats your excuse now for not trying to get yours
693250 from our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our fathers labor their flocks and herds their sons and daughters let us lie down in our shame and let our disgrace cover us we have sinned against the lord our god both we and our fathers from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the lord our god
693251 therefore since through gods mercy we have this ministry we do not lose heart rather we have renounced secret and shameful ways we do not use deception nor do we distort the word of god on the contrary by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing

693272 a great moment something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this is the first of many
693273 at the end i tried to put pressure on massa and hoped something would happen and it worked out that way
693274 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory so im very glad to get this first win
693275 its nowhere near as bad as it could have been i could have had felipe and kimi right at the front
693276 it was a surprise that we werent as quick as we should have been we were quick at the beginning but struggled with our tyres
693277 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
693278 we could have managed to do the race a little better and i was stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop
693279 we just need to sort out the problems and then we will be fighting for wins
693280 the olympic games are also as a matter of record a fascist spectacle sustained by global corporatism
693281 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step
693282 a cry to the unknown the fundamental sigh of all whove gone this way before
693283 its the hardest decision i ever had to make but also the easiest
693284 this approach crystallises value for the group on an ongoing basis
693285 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
693286 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
693287 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less

693296 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
693297 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
693298 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
693299 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues
693300 but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
693301 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
693302 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare

693318 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
693319 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
693320 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
693321 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
693322 embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other
693323 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
693324 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico

693326 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
693327 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure

693329 a lot of us feel that weve watched large sectors of our christian community in the u
693330 it was hell how could they not tell civilians from north korean troops
693331 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
693332 the u s military hardly took into consideration a risk that its massive bombing and incineration operations could take heavy tolls on civilians
693333 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
693334 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go
693335 and then the fire incinerated everything and spread into the cave
693336 his bowels spilled out his mother fell down and cried over his body in the shower of bullets
693337 it was really tough to try to decide who was who and who should we hit
693338 i know at times we were ordered to strafe refugees in fact i pulled fighters off refugees at times
693339 that was a typical observation for a pilot and observer
693340 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
693341 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
693342 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
693343 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
693344 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
693345 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
693346 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
693347 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
693348 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
693349 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
693350 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
693351 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
693352 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
693353 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
693354 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
693355 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
693356 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
693357 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
693358 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
693359 would you mind to have a coffee with me we have fifteen minutes to restarting the work

693369 how comfortable are you guys that your email server is free of uh other eyes
693370 oh yeah yeah weve checked out our email server and our email server itself has not been compromised
693371 in the beginning i had no motivation against monkey defenders
693372 it wasnt like i want to hack those bastards but then i found something and the good nature in me said these guys are not right im going to destroy them
693373 we showed him how we could block it from getting out onto the internet
693374 most users are likely individuals who in the absence of file sharing would not have bought the music they downloaded
693375 roughly half of all p2p tracks were downloaded because individuals wanted to hear songs before buying them or because they wanted to avoid purchasing the whole bundle of songs on the associated cds and roughly one quarter were downloaded because they were not available for purchase
693376 online piracy has got to be stopped the biggest spear in the neck of the pirates will be a being vigilant b prosecuting and c in a way making fun of them finding a way to say thats not anything but cool if you had people who the young people respect in this industry brad pitt george clooney shia labeouf if these guys did public service announcements that said dont steal stealings not cool i think you can go a long way toward stopping this
693377 the music companies were put on earth to make the video companies seem like visionaries
693378 the owners of the pirate bay willfully and unlawfully exploit and misappropriate both princes and the village peoples intellectual property and infringe on their rights of publicity blah blah blah
693379 i was reading this yesterday and i started laughing so hard

693382 randy will ask you very soon so im just trying to preempt a shitstorm
693383 as long as what youre doing is legal why should you be attacked by someone using illegal methods
693384 hollywood is not burned out on silver bullet technologies the way music is after years of defeat
693385 its just 1999 for video and the gold rush may be on now
693386 what should a police department do when it turns out theres been a burglary
693387 should the police department give up close its doors and say this is an impossible task no thats silly
693388 our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the dvd screeners and put the movie online for all to download people like our movie and are talking about it all thanks to piracy on the net
693389 in the future i will not complain about file sharing you have helped put this little movie on the map when i make my next picture i just may upload the movie on the net myself
693390 as a filmmaker i love that people love the movie and have seen the movie but as a person who literally has a hunk of his own life savings in the movie i dont want to be ripped off by people illegally downloading the movie some of these downloaders want to believe theyre fighting the man but were all just people who work for a living
693391 mr george a loner and epileptic who suffers from mental illness has consistently insisted he did not murder ms dando

693393 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
693394 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
693395 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
693396 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
693397 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
693398 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
693399 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
693400 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion

693419 jika anda menanyakan dimana rumah tuhan jawabnya tidaklah sulit allah berada pada dzat yang tempatnya tidak jauh yaitu bersemayam di dalam tubuh tetapi hanya orang yang terpilih yang bisa melihatnya yaitu orang yang suci

693422 lain jika kita sejiwa dengan zat yang maha luhur ia gagah berani naha sakti dalam syarak menjelajahi alam semesta dia itu pangeran saya yang menguasai dan memerintah saya yang bersifat wahdaniyah artinya menyatukan diri dengan ciptaan nya ia dapat abadi mengembara melebihi peluru atau anak sumpitan bukan budi bukan nyawa bukan hidup tanpa asal dari manapun bukan pula kehendak tanpa tujuan
693423 dia itu yang bersatu padu menjadi wujud saya tiada susah payah kodrat dan kehendak nya pergi ke mana saja tiada haus tiada lelah tanpa penderitaan dan tiada lapar kekuasan nya dan kemampuan nya tiada kenal rintangan sehingga pikiran keras dari keinginan luluh tiada berdaya maka timbullah dari jiwa raga saya kearif bijaksanaan tanpa saya ketahui keluar dan masuk nya tahu tahu saya menjumpai ia sudah ada disana
693424 rahasia kesadaran kesejatian kehidupan ya ingsun ini kesejatian hidup engkau sejatinnya allah ya ingsun sejatinya allah yakni wujud yang berbentuk itu sejatinya allah sir rahsa rahasia itu rasulullah lisan pangucap itu allah jasad allah badan putih tanpa darah sir allah rasa allah rahasia kesejatian allah ya ingsun aku ini sejatinya allah
693425 adanya kehidupan itu karena pribadi demikian pula keinginan hidup itupun ditetapkan oleh diri sendiri tidak mengenal roh yang melestarikan kehidupan tiada turut merasakan sakit ataupun lelah suka dukapun musnah karena tiada diinginkan oleh hidup dengan demikian hidupnya kehidupan itu berdiri sendiri sekehendak
693426 wujud itu dalam pribadi dan di dunia atau alam kematian ini memerlukan wadah bagi pribadi untuk mengejawantah menguji diri sejauh mana kemampuannya mengelola keinginan wadag sementara pribadinya tetap suci
693427 zat wajibul maulana adalah yang menjadi pemimpin budi yang menuju ke semua kebaikan citra manusia hanya ada dalam keinginan yang tunggal satu keinginan saja belum tentu dapat melaksanakan dengan tepat apa lagi dua nah cobalah untuk memisahkan zat wab jibul maulana dengan budi agar supaya manusia dapat menerima keinginan yang lain
693428 hyang widi kalau dikatakan dalam bahasa di dunia ini baka bersifat abadi tanpa antara tiada erat dengan sakit ataupun rasa tidak enak ia berada baik di sana maupun di sini bukan itu bukan ini oleh tingkah yang banyak dilakukan dan yang tidak wajar menuruti raga adalah sesuatu yang baru segala sesuatu yang berwujud yang tersebar di dunia ini bertentangan dengan sifat seluruh yang diciptakan sebab isi bumi itu angkasa yang hampa
693429 gagasan adanya badan halus itu mematikan kehendak manusia dimanakah adanya hyang sukma kecuali hanya diri pribadi kelilingilah cakrawala dunia membumbunglah ke langit yang tinggi selamilah dalam bumi sampai lapisan ke tujuh tiada ditemukan wujud yang mulia
693430 ke mana saja sunyi senyap adanya ke utara selatan barat timur dan tengah yang ada di sana sana hanya di sini adanya yang ada di sini bukan wujud saya yang ada didalamku adalah hampa yang sunyi isi dalam daging tubuh adalah isi perut yang kotor maka bukan jantung bukan otak yang pisah dari tubuh laju pesat bagaikan anak panah lepas dari busur menjelajah mekah dan madinah
693431 saya ini bukan budi bukan angan angan hati bukan pikiran yang sadar bukan niat bukan udara bukan angin bukan panas dan bukan kekosongan atau kehampaan wujud saya ini jasad yang akhirnya menjadi jenazah busuk bercampur tanah dan debu napas saya mengelilingi dunia tanah api air dan udara kembali ke tempat asalnya atau aslinya sebab semuanya barang baru bukan asli
693432 maka saya ini zat yang sejiwa menyukma dalam hyang widi pangeran saya bersifat jalal dan jamal artinya mahamulia dan mahaindah ia tidak mau shalat atas kehendak sendiri tidak pula mau memerintahkan untuk shalat kepada siapapun adapun orang shalat itu budi yang menyuruh budi yang laknat dan mencelakakan tidak dapat dipercaya dan diturut karena perintahnya berubah ubah perkataannya tidak dapat dipegang tidak jujur jika diturut tidak jadi dan selalu mengajak mencuri
693433 syukur kalo saya sampai tiba di alam kehidupan yang sejati dalam alam kematian ini saya kaya akan dosa siang malam saya berdekatan dengan api neraka sakit dan sehat saya temukan di dunia ini lain halnya apabila saya sudah lepas dari alam saya kematian ini saya akan hidup sempurna langgeng tiada ini itu
693434 menduakan kerja bukan watak saya siapa yang mau mati dalam alam kematian orang kaya akan dosa balik jika saya hidup yang tak kenal ajal akan langgeng hidup saya tidak perlu ini itu akan tetapi bila saya disuruh milih hidup atau mati saya tidak sudi sekalipun saya hidup biar saya sendiri yang menentukan tidak usah walisanga memulangkan saya ke alam kehidupan macam bukan wali utama saya ini mau hidup saja minta tolong pada sesamanya nah marilah kamu saksikan saya akan pulang sendiri ke alam kehidupan sejati
693435 tersasar tersesat lagi terjerumus menjadikan kecemasan menyusahkan dalam patinya justru bagi ilmu orang remeh
693436 kepada mereka siti jenar pertama tama mengajarkan akan asal usul kehidupan kedua diberitahukan akan pintu kehidupan
693437 insun anakseni ing datingsun dhewe satuhune ora ana pangeran amung ingsun lan nakseni ingsun satuhune muhammad iku utusan ingsun iya sajatine kang aran allah iku badan ingsun rasul iku rahsaning sun muhammad iku cahyaning sun iya ingsun kang eling tan kena ing lali iya ingsun kan langgeng ora kena owah gingsir ing kahanan jati iya ingsun kang waskitha ora kasamaran ing sawiji wiji iya ingsun kang amurba amisesa kang kawasa wicaksana ora kukurangan ing pangerti byar sampurna padhang terawang an ora karasa apa apa ora ana keton apa apa mung insun kang nglimputi ing ngalam kabeh kalawan kodrating sun
693438 aku angkat saksi di hadapan dzat ku sendiri sesungguhnya tidak ada tuhan kecuali aku dan aku angkat saksi sesungguhnya muhammad itu utusan ku sesungguhnya yg disebut allah ingsun diri sendiri badan ku rasul itu rahsa ku muhammad itu cahaya ku akulah dzat yg hidup tidak akan terkena mati akulah dzat yang selalu ingat tidak pernah lupa akulah dzat yg kekal tidak ada perubahan dalam segala keadaan bagi ku tidak ada yg samar sesuatupun akulah dzat yang maha menguasai yang kuasa dan bijaksana tidak kekurangan dalam pengertian sempurna terang benerang tidak terasa apa apa tidak kelihatan apa apa hanya aku yg meliputi sekalian alam dengan kodrat ku
693439 adapun manunggalnya keimanan itu menjadi tempat berkumpulnya jauhar mutiara muhammad terdiri atas 15 perkara seperti perincian di bawah ini a imannya imam maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah keberadaan allah b imannya tokide tauhid maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah panunggale tempat manunggalnya allah c imannya syahadat maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah sifatullah sifatnya allah d imannya marifat maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah kewaspadaan allah e imannya shalat maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah menghadap allah f imannya kehidupan maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah kehidupannya allah g imannya takbir maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah kepunyaan keangungan allah h imannya saderah maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah pertemuan allah i imannya kematian maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah kesucian allah j imannya junud maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah wadahnya allah k imannya jinabat maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah kawimbuhaning bertambahnya nimat dan anugerah allah l imannya wudlu maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah asma nama allah m imannya kalam perkataan maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah ucapan allah n imannya akal maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah juru bicara allah o imannya nur maksudnya adalah jangan ragu dan jangan mensekutukan engkau adalah wujudullah yaitu tempat berkumpulnya seluruh jagat makrokosmos dunia akhirat surga neraka arsy kursi loh kalam lauh al kalam bumi langit manusia jin belis iblis laknat malaikat nabi wali orang mukmin nyawa semua itu berkumpul di pucuknya jantung yang disebut alam kiyal alam al khayal maksudnya adalah angan angannya tuhan itulah yang agung yang disebut alam barzakh yang dimaksudnya adalah pamoring gusti kawula yang disebut alam mitsal yang dimaksudnya adalah awal pengetahuan yaitu kesucian dzat sifat asma afal yang disebut alam arwah maksudnya berkumpulnya nyawa yang adalah dipenuhi sifat kamal jamal
693440 yang disebut kodrat itu yang berkuasa tiada yang mirip atau yang menyamai kekuasaannya tanpa piranti keadaan wujudnya tidak ada baik luar maupun dalam merupakan kesantrian yang beraneka ragam iradatnya artinya kehendak yang tiada membicarakan ilmu untuk mengetahui keadaan yang lepas jauh dari pancaindera bagaikan anak gumpitan lepas tertiup
693441 inilah maksud syahadat ashadu jatuhnya rasa ilaha kesejatian rasa illallah bertemu rasa muhammad hasil karya yang maujud pangeran kesejatian kehidupan
693442 bismillahirrahmanirrahim syahadat kencana sinarawedi sahadu minangka kencana sinarawedi dzat sukma kang ginawa mati kurungan mas ilang tanpa kerana sira muliha maring kubur
693443 bismillahirrahmanirrahim syahadat kencana linggih ing maligi mas ulir sjroh ning geni muskala ilang ing kawulat aja kari ya hu ya hu ya hu sirna kurungan tanpa kerana
693444 bismillahirrahmanirrahim syahadat kencana kurungan mas kuliting jati sajatining sukma ginawa mati sirna tan ana kari sukma ilang jiwa ilang kang lunga padha rupane dap lap ilang
693445 mengertilah bahwa sesungguhnya ini syahadat sakarat jika tidak tau maka sekaratnya masih mendapatkan halangan hidupnya dan matinya hanya seperti hewan
693446 syahadat sakarat sajati iya syahadat sakarat wus gumanang waluya jati sirne eling mulya maring tunggal waluya jati iya sajatining rasa lan dzat sajatining dzat pesthi anane langgeng tan kenaning owah dzat sakarat roh madhep ati muji matring nyawa tansah neng dzatullah kurungan mas melesat eling raga tan rusak sukma mulya maha suci

693450 sekarat ku kemuliaan kematian maksudnya adalah napas munculnya napas yang hilang berangsur angsur secara diam diam yaitu yang kemudian diam kematian sebagai sukma badan wadag kemuliaan sukma kesempurnaan kembali kepada dzatullah allah sebagai labuhan iman iman yang berbentuk cahaya cahaya yang berwujud rasulullah yaitu adalah shalat yang agung muhammad sebagai takbirku allah sebagai ucapanku shalat sejati menyembah allah tidak ada allah tidak ada tuhan hanyalah aku kawula yang tunggal saja yang agung dan dikasihi
693451 ashadu ananingsun anuduhake marga kang padhang kang urip tan kenaning pati mulya tan kawoworan elinge tan kena lali iya rasa iya rasulullah sirna manjing sarira ening sirna wening tunggal idhep jumeneng langgeng amisesa budine angen angene tansah amadhep ing pangeran

693453 ini adalah syahadat sakaratnya roh pecating nyawa yang meliputi empat perkara 1
693454 niyatingsun shalat roh kudus kang shalat iya iku rohing allah allah iku lungguh ana ing paningal shalat iku sajrone shalat ana gusti sajroning gusti ana sukma sajroning sukma ana nyawa sajroning nyawa ana urip sajro ning urip ana eling pardhu taala allahu akbar tetep mantep weruh ing awakku

693468 lah giri giri allah sir jeneng sir jumeneng allah nur gumulung gumulung agawe jagat
693469 inilah shalat satu rakaat salam yang dilaksanakan setiap tanggal bulan purnama dengan waktu tengah malam tepat a
693470 ingsun kang agung ingsun kang memelihara kehidupan yang tidak terkena kema tian
693471 shalat lima kali sehari puji dan dzikir itu adalah kebijaksanaan dalam hati menurut kehendak pribadi benar atau salah pribadi sendiri yang akan menerima dengan segala keberanian yang dimiliki
693472 pada waktu saya shalat budi saya mencuri pada waktu saya dzikir budi saya melepaskan hati menaruh hati kepada seseorang kadang kadang menginginkan keduniaan yang banyak lain dengan zat allah yang bersama diriku nah saya inilah yang maha suci zat maulana yang nyata yang tidak dapat dipikirkan dan tidak dapat dibayangkan
693473 syahadat shalat dan puasa itu sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan jadi tidak perlu adapun zakat dan naik haji ke mekah itu semua omong kosong palson kabeh itu seluruhnya kedurjanaan budi penipuan terhadap sesama manusia orang orang dungu yg menuruti aulia karena diberi harapan surga di kelak kemudian hari itu sesungguhnya keduanya orang yang tidak tahu lain halnya dengan saya siti jenar tiada pernah saya menuruti perintah budi bersujud sujud di mesjid mengenakan jubah pahalanya besok saja bila dahi sudah menjadi tebal kepala berbelulang sesungguhnya hal ini tidak masuk akal di dunia ini semua manusia adalah sama mereka semua mengalami suka duka menderita sakit dan duka nestapa tiada beda satu dengan yang lain oleh karena itu saya siti jenar hanya setia pada satu hal saja yaitu gusti zat maulana
693474 itulah yang dianggap syekh siti jenar hyang widi ia berbuat baik dan menyembah atas kehendak nya tekad lahiriahnya dihapus tingkah lakunya mirip dengan pendapat yg ia lahirkan ia berketetapan hati untuk berkiblat dan setia teguh dalam pendiriannya kukuh menyucikan diri dari segala yg kotor untuk sampai menemui ajalnya tidak menyembah kepada budi dan cipta syekh siti jenar berpendapat dan menggangap dirinya bersifat muhammad yaitu sifat rasul yg sejati sifat muhammad yg kudus
693475 gusti zat maulana dialah yg luhur dan sangat sakti yg berkuasa maha besar lagipula memiliki dua puluh sifat kuasa atas kehendak nya dialah yg maha kuasa pangkal mula segala ilmu maha mulia maha indah maha sempurna maha kuasa rupa warna nya tanpa cacat seperti hamba nya di dalam raga manusia ia tiada nampak ia sangat sakti menguasai segala yg terjadi dan menjelajahi seluruh alam semesta ngidraloka
693476 bonang kamu mengundang saya datang di demak saya malas untuk datang sebab saya merasa tidak di bawah atau diperintah oleh siapapun kecuali oleh hati saya perintah hati itu yang saya turutinya selain itu tidak ada yang saya patuhi perintahnya bukankah kita sesama mayat mengapa seseorang memerintah orang lain manusia itu sama satu dengan yang lain sama sama tidak mengetahui siapa hyang sukma itu yang disembah itu hanya nama nya saja meskipun demikian ia bersikap sombong dan merasa berkuasa memerintah sesama bangkai
693477 hyang widi wujud yg tak nampak oleh mata mirip dengan ia sendiri sifat sifatnya mempunyai wujud seperti penampakan raga yg tiada tampak warnanya melambangkan keselamatan tetapi tanpa cahaya atau teja halus lurus terus menerus menggambarkan kenyataan tiada berdusta ibaratnya kekal tiada bermula sifat dahulu yg meniadakan permulaan karena asal dari diri pribadi
693478 sabda sukma adhep idhep allah kang anembah allah kang sinembah allah kang murba amisesa
693479 pernyataan roh yang bertemu hadapan dengan allah yang menyembah allah yang disembah allah yang meliputi segala sesuatu
693480 hidup itu bersifat baru dan dilengkapi dengan pancaindera pancaindera ini merupakan barang pinjaman yang jika sudah diminta oleh yang empunya akan menjadi tanah dan membusuk hancurlebur bersifat najis oleh karena itu pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pedoman hidup demikian pula budi pikiran angan angan dan kesadaran berasal dari pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pegangan hidup akal dapat menjadi gila sedih bingung lupa tidur dan seringkali tidak jujur akal itu pula yang siang malam mengajak dengki bahkan merusak kebahagiaan orang lain dengki dapat pula menuju perbuatan jahat menimbulkan kesombongan untuk akhirnya jatuh dalam lembah kenistaan sehingga menodai nama dan citranya kalau sudah sampai sedemikian jauhnya baru orang menyesalkan perbuatannya
693481 apakah tidak tahu bahwa penampilan bentuk daging urat tulang sungsum bisa rusak dan bagaimana cara anda memperbaikinya biarpun bersembahyang seribu kali setiap harinya akhirnya mati juga meskipun badan anda anda tutupi akhirnya menjadi debu juga tetapi jika penampilan bentuknya seperti tuhan apakah para wali dapat membawa pulang dagingnya saya rasa tidak dapat alam semesta ini baru tuhan tidak akan membentuk dunia ini dua kali dan juga tidak akan membuat tatanan baru dalilnya layabtakiru hilamuhdil yang artinya tidak membuat sesuatu wujud lagi tentang terjadinya alam semesta sesudah dia membuat dunia
693482 segala sesuatu yang terjadi di alam semesta ini pada hakikatnya adalah afal perbuatan allah berbagai hal yang dinilai baik maupun buruk pada hakikatnya adalah dari allah juga jadi keliru dan sesat pandangan yang mengatakan bahwa yang baik dari allah dan yang buruk selain allah
693483 afal allah harus dipahami dari dalam dan luar diri saat manusia menggoreskan pena misalnya di situlah terjadi perpaduan dua kemampuan kodrati yang dipancarkan oleh allah kepada makhluk nya yakni kemampuan kodrati gerak pena di situlah berlaku dalil wa allahu khalaqakum wa ma tamalun qs ash shaffat 96 yang maknanya allah yang menciptakan engkau dan segala apa yang engkau perbuat di sini terkandung makna mubasyarah perbuatan yang terlahir dari itu disebut al tawallud misalnya saya melempar batu batu yang terlempar dari tangan saya itu adalah berdasar kemampuan kodrati gerak tangan saya di situ berlaku dalil wa ma ramaitaidz ramaita walakinna allaha rama qs al anfal 17 maksudnya bukanlah engkau yang melempar melainkan allah jua yang melempar ketika engkau melempar namun pada hakikatnya antara mubasyarah dan al tawallud hakikatnya satu yakni afal allah sehingga berlaku dalil la haula wa la quwwata illa bi allahi al aliyi al adzimi rasulullah bersabda la tataharraku dzarratun illa bi idzni allahi yang maksudnya tidak bergerak satu dzarah pun melainkan atas izin allah
693484 di di dunia ini kita merupakan mayat mayat yang cepat juga akan menjadi busuk dan bercampur tanah ketahuilah juga apa yang dinamakan kawula gusti tidak berkaitan dengan seorang manusia biasa seperti yang lain lain kawula dan gusti itu sudah ada dalam diriku siang malam tidak dapat memisahkan diriku dari mereka tetapi hanya untuk saat ini nama kawula gusti itu berlaku yakni selama saya mati nanti kalau saya sudah hidup lagi gusti dan kawula lenyap yang tinggal hanya hidupku sendiri ketentraman langgeng dalam ada sendiri bila kau belum menyadari kebenaran kata kataku maka dengan tepat dapat dikatakan bahwa kau masih terbenam dalam masa kematian di sini memang terdapat banyak hiburan aneka warna lebih banyak lagi hal hal yang menimbulkan hawa nafsu tetapi kau tidak melihat bahwa itu hanya akibat pancaindera itu hanya impian yang sama sekali tidak mengandung kebenaran dan sebentar lagi akan cepat lenyap gilalah orang yang terikat padanya saya tidak merasa tertarik tak sudi tersesat dalam kerajaan kematian satu satunya yang kuusahakan ialah kembali kepada kehidupan
693485 syekh siti jenar berpendapat dan mengganggap dirinya bersifat muhammad yaitu sifat rasul yang sejati sifat muhammad yang kudus ia berpendapat juga bahwa hidup itu bersifat baru dan dilengkapi dengan pancaindera pancaindera ini merupakan barang pinjaman yang jika sudah diminta oleh empunya akan menjadi tanah dan membusuk hancur lebur bersifat najis oleh karena itu pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pedoman hidup
693486 demikian pula budi pikiran angan angan dan kesadaran berasal dari pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pegangan hidup akal dapat menjadi gila sedih bingung lupa tidur dan sering kali tidak jujur akal itu pula yang siang malam mengajak dengki bahkan merusak kebahagiaan orang lain dengki dapat pula menuju perbuatan jahat menimbulkan kesombongan untuk akhirnya jatuh dalam lembah kenistaan sehingga menodai nama dan citranya
693487 kalau kamu ingin berjumpa dengan dia saya pastikan kamu tidak akan menemuinya sebab kyai ageng berbadan sukma mengheningkan puja ghaib yang dipuja dan yang memuja yang dilihat dan melihat yang bersabda sedang bertutur gerak dan diam bersatu tunggal nah buyung yang sedang berkunjung lebih baik kembali saja
693488 bukan kehendak angan angan bukan ingatan pikir atau niat hawa nafsu pun bukan bukan juga kekosongan atau kehampaan
693489 adapun asalnya kehidupan itu berdasar kitab marifat aliman seperti dijelaskan di bawah ini terbebani 16 macam titipan
693490 kehilangan adalah kepedihan berbahagialah engkau wahai musafir papa yang tidak memiliki apa apa sebab engkau yang tidak memiliki apa apa maka tidak pernah kehilangan apa apa
693491 jika engkau kagum kepada seseorang yang engkau anggap wali allah janganlah engkau terpancang pada kekaguman akan sosok dan perilaku yang diperbuatnya sebab saat seseorang berada pada tahap kewalian maka keberadaan dirinya sebagai manusia telah lenyap tenggelam ke dalam al waly kewalian bersifat terus menerus hanya saja saat sang wali tenggelam dalam al waly berlangsungnya cuma beberapa saat dan saat tenggelam ke dalam al waly itulah sang wali benar benar menjadi pengejawantahan al waly lantaran itu sang wali memiliki kekeramatan yang tidak bisa diukur dengan akal pikiran manusia di mana karamah itu sendiri pada hakikatnya adalah pengejawantahan dari kekuasaan al waly dan lantaran itu pula yang dinamakan karamah adalah sesuatu di luar kehendak sang wali pribadi semua itu semata mata kehendak nya mutlak kekasih allah itu ibarat cahaya jika ia berada di kejauhan kelihatan sekali terangnya namun jika cahaya itu di dekatkan ke mata mata kita akan silau dan tidak bisa melihatnya dengan jelas semakin dekat cahaya itu ke mata maka kita akan semakin buta tidak bisa melihatnya engkau bisa melihat cahaya kewalian pada diri seseorang yang jauh darimu namun engkau tidak bisa melihat cahaya kewalian yang memancar dari diri orang orang yang terdekat denganmu
693492 di sini tidak ada syekh siti jenar yang ada hanya allah
693493 di sini tidak ada allah yang ada hanya siti jenar
693494 di sini tidak ada syekh siti jenar yang ada hanya allah
693495 di sini tidak ada allah yang ada hanya siti jenar
693496 kalau menurut wejangan guru saya orang sembahyang itu siang malam tiada putusnya ia lakukan hai bonang ketahuilah keluarnya napasku menjadi puji maksudnya napasku menjadi shalat karena tutur penglihatan dan pendengaran disuruh melepaskan dari angan angan jadi kalau kamu shalat masih mengiaskan kelanggengan dalam alam kematian ini maka sesungguhnyalah kamu ini orang kafir
693497 jika kamu bijaksana mengatur tindakanmu tanpa guna orang menyembah rabbul alamien tuhan sekalian alam sebab di dunia ini tidak ada hyang agung karena orang melekat pada bangkai meskipun dicat dilapisi emas akhirnya membusuk juga hancur lebur bercampur dengan tanah bagaimana saya dapat bersolek
693498 menurut wejangan syekh siti jenar orang sembahyang tidak memperoleh apa apa baik di sana maupun di sini nyatanya kalau ia sakit ia menjadi bingung jika tidur seperti budak disembarang tempat jika ia miskin mohon agar menjadi kaya tidak dikabulkan apalagi bila ia sakaratul maut matanya membelalak tiada kerohan karena ia segan meninggalkan dunia ini demikianlah wejangan guru saya yang bijaksana
693499 umumnya santri dungu hanya berdzikir dalam keadaan kosong dari kenyataan yang sesungguhnya membayangkan adanya rupa zat ullahu kemudian ada rupa dan inilah yang ia anggap hyang widi
693500 apakah ini bukan barang sesat buktinya kalau ia memohon untuk menjadi orang kaya tidak diluluskan sekalipun demikian saya disuruh meluhurkan dzatllahu yang rupanya ia lihat waktu ia berdzikir mengikuti syara sebagai syariat jika jumat ke mesjid berlenggang mengangguk angguk memuji pangeran yang sunyi senyap bukan yang di sana bukan yang di sini
693501 saya disuruh makbudullah meluhurkan tuhan itu serta akan ditipu diangkat menjadi wali berkeliling menjual tutur sambil mencari nasi gurih dengan lauknya ayam betina berbulu putih yang dimasak bumbu rujak pada selamatan meluhurkan rasulullah ia makan sangat lahap meskipun lagaknya seperti orang yang tidak suka makan hal itulah gambaran raja penipu
693502 bonang jangan berbuat yang demikian ketahuilah dunia ini alam kematian sedang akhirat alam kehidupan yang langgeng tiada mengenal waktu barang siapa senang pada alam kematian ini ia terjerat goda terlekat pada surga dan neraka menemui panas sedih haus dan lapar
693503 tiada usah merasa enggan menerima petuahku yang tiga buah jumlahnya pertama janganlah hendaknya kamu menjalankan penipuan yang keterlaluan agar supaya kamu tidak ditertawakan orang di kelak kemudian hari yang kedua jangan kamu merusak barang barang peninggalan purba misalnya lontar naskah sastra yang indah indah tulisan dan gambar gambar pada batu candhi demikian pula kayu dan batu yang merupakan peninggalan kebudayaan zaman dulu jangan kamu hancur leburkan ketahuilah bagi suku jawa sifat sifat hindu budha tidak dapat dihapus yang ketiga jika kamu setuju mesjid ini sebaiknya kamu buang saja musnahkan dengan api saya berbelas kasihan kepada keturunanmu sebab tidak urung mereka menuruti kamu mabuk doa tersesat mabuk tobat berangan angan lam yakunil
693504 orang menyembah nama yang tiada wujudnya harus dicegah maka dari itu jangan kamu terus teruskan sebab itu palsu
693505 banyak orang yang gemar dengan ksejatian tapi karena belum pernah berguru maka semua itu dipahami dalam konteks dualitas yang satu dianggap wjud lain sesungguhnya orang yng melihat sepeti ini akan kecewa apalagi yang ditemui akan menjadi hilang walaupun dia berkeliling mencari ia tidak akan menemukan yang dicari padahal yang dicari sesungguhnya telah ditimang dan dipegang bahkan sampai keberatan membawanya dan karena belum tahu kesejatiannya ciptanya tanpa guru menyepelekan tulisan dan kesejatian tuhan
693506 walaupun dituturkan sampai capai ditunjukkan jalannya sesungguhnya dia tidak memahaminya karena ia hanya sibuk menghitung dosa besar dan kecil yg diketahuinya tentang hal kufur kafir yang ditolaknya itu bukti bahwa ia adalah orang yang masih mentah pengetahuannya walaupun tidak pernah lupa sembahyang puasanya dapat dibangga banggakan tanpa sela tapi ia terjebak menaati yang sudah ditentukan tuhan sembah puji dan puasa yang ditekuni membuat orang justru lupa akan sangkan paran asal dan tujuan karena itu ia lebih konsentrasi melihat dosa besar kecil yang dikhawatirkan dan ajaran kufur kafir yang dijauhi justru membuat bingung sikapnya tidak ada dulu dinulu tidak merasa tidak menyentuh tidak saling mendekati sehingga buta orang itu takdir dianggap tidak akan terjadi salah salah menganggap ada dualisme antara maha pencipta dan maha memelihara jika aku punya pemikiran yang demikian lebih baik aku mati saja ketika masih bayi tidak terhitung tidak berfikir banyak orang yang merasa menggeluti tata lafal mengkaji sembahyang dan berletih letih berpuasa semua itu dianggap akan mampu mengantarkan padahal salah salah menjadikan celaka dan bahkan banyak yang menjadi berhala
693507 pemikiran saya sejak kecil islam tidak dengan sembahyang islam tidak dengan pakaian islam tidak dengan waktu islam tidak dengan baju dan islam tidak dengan bertapa dalam pemikiran saya yang dimaksud islam tidak karena menolak atau menerima yang halal atau haram adapun yang dimaksud orang islam itu mulia wisesa jati kemuliaan selamat sempurna sampai tempat tinggalnya besok seperti bulu selembar atau tepung segelintir hangus tak tersisa kehidupan di dunia seperti itu keberadaannya
693508 manusia sebelum tahu makna alif akan menjadi berantakan alif menjadi panutan sebab uintuk semua huruf alif adalah yang pertama alif itu badan idlafi sebagai anugerah dua duanya bukan allah alif merupakan takdir sedangkan yang tidak bersatu namanya alif lapat sebelum itu jagat ciptaan nya sudah ada lalu alif menjadi gantinya yang memiliki wujud tunggal ya tunggal rasa tunggal wujud ketunggalan ini harus dijaga betul sebab tidak ada yang mengaku tingkahnya alif wujud adalah yang agung ia menjadi wujud mutlak yang merupakan kesejatian rasa jenisnya ada lima yaitu alif mata wajah niat jati iman syariat
693509 allah itu penjabarannya adalah dzat yang maha mulia dan maha suci allah itu sebenarnya tidak ada lain karena kamu itu allah dan allah semua yang ada ini lahir batin kamu ini semua tulisan merupakan ganti dari alif allah itulah adanya
693510 alif penjabarannya adalah permulaan pada penglihatan melihat yang benar benar melihat adapun melihat dzat itu merupakan cermin ketunggalan sejati menurun kepada kesejatianmu cahaya yang keluar kepada otak keberadaan kita di dunia ini merupakan cahaya yang terang benderang itu memiliki seratus dua puluh tujuh kejadian menjadi penglihatan dan pendengaran napas yang tunggal napas kehidupan yang dinamakan panji panji bayangan dzat yang mewujud pada kebanyakkan imam semua menyebut dzikir sejati laa ilaaha illallah
693511 banyak orang yang salah menemui ajalnya mereka tersesat tidak menentu arahnya pancaindera masih tetap siap segala kesenangan sudah ditahan napas sudah tergulung dan angan angan sudah diikhlaskan tetapi ketika lepas tirta nirmayanya belum mau maka ia menemukan yang serba indah
693512 dan ia dianggap manusia yang luar biasa padahal sesungguhnya ia adalah orang yang tenggelam dalam angan angan yang menyesatkan dan tidak nyata budi dan daya hidupnya tidak mau mati ia masih senang di dunia ini dengan segala sesuatu yang hidup masih senang ia akan rasa dan pikirannya baginya hidup di dunia ini nikmat itulah pendapat manusia yang masih terpikat akan keduniawian pendapat gelandangan yang pergi ke mana mana tidak menentu dan tidak tahu bahwa besok ia akan hidup yang tiada kenal mati sesungguhnyalah dunia ini neraka
693513 maka pendapat kyai siti jenar betul saya setuju dan tuan benar benar seorang mukmin yang berpendapat tepat dan seyogyanya tuan jadi cermin suri tauladan bagi orang orang lain tarkumasiwalahu arab asli tarku ma siwa allahu di dunia ini hamba campur dengan kholiqbta hambanya di surga khaliknya di neraka agung
693514 menurut ajaran guruku syekh siti jenar di dunia ini alam kematian oleh karena itu dunia yang sunyi ini tidak ada hyang agung serta malaikat akan tetapi bila saya besok sudah ada di alam kehidupan saya akan berjumpa dan kadang kala saya menjadi allah nah di situ saya akan bersembahyang
693515 jika sekarang saya disuruh sholat di mesjid saya tidak mau meskipun saya bukan orang kafir boleh jadi saya orang terlantar akan pangeran tuhan kalau santri gundul tidak tahunya yang ada di sini atau di sana ia berpengangan kandhilullah mabuk akan allah buta lagi tuli
693516 lain halnya dengan saya murid syekh siti jenar saya tidak menghiraukan ujar para wali yang mengkukuhkan syariat palsu yang merugikan diri sendiri nah syekh dumba pikirkanlah semua yang saya katakan ini dalam dadamu ada sesuai atau tidak yang saya tuturkan itu kanda pasti tahu
693517 pertanyaan pertama pertanyaan bahwa allah menciptakan alam semesta itu adalah kebohongan belaka sebab alam semesta itu barang baru sedang allah tidak membuat barang yang berwujud menurut dalil layatikbiyu hilamuhdil artinya tiada berkehendak menciptakan barang yang berwujud adapun terjadinya alam semesta ini ibaratnya drikumahiyati artinya menemukan keadaan alam semesta ini la awali artinya tiada berawal panjang sekali kiranya kalau hamba menguraikan bahwa alam semesta ini merupakan barang baru berdasarkan yang ditulis dalam kuran
693518 pertanyaan yang kedua paduka bertanya di mana rumah hyang widi hal itu bukan merupakan hal yang sulit sebab allah sejiwa dengan semua zat zat wajibul wujud itulah tempat tinggalnya seumpamanya zat tanahlah rumahnya hal ini panjang sekali kalau hamba terangkan oleh karena itu hamba cukupkan sekian saja uraian hamba
693519 selanjutnya pertanyaan ketiga berkurangnya nyawa siang malam sampai habis ke manakah perginya nyawa itu nah itu sangat mudah untuk menjawabnya sebab nyawa tidak dapat berkurang maka nyawa itu bagaikan jasad berupa gundukan dapat aus rusak dimakan anai anai hal inipun akan panjang sekali untuk hamba uraikan meskipun hamba orang sudra asal desa akan tetapi tata bahasa kawi hamba mengetahui juga baik bahasa biasa maupun yang dapat dinyanyikan lagu tembang sansekerta pun hamba dapat menyanyikan juga dengan menguraikan arti kalimatnya sekaligus hamba bukan seorang empu atau pujangga melainkan seorang yang hanya tahu sedikit tentang ilmu
693520 itu semua disebabkan karena hamba berguru kepada syekh siti jenar di krendhasawa tekun mempelajari kesusasteraan dan menuruti perintah guru yang bijaksana semua murid syekh siti jenar menjadi orang yang cakap berkat kemampuan mereka untuk menerima ajaran guru mereka sepenuh hati
693521 adapun pertanyaan yang keempat paduka bertanya bagaimanakah rupa yang maha suci itu kitab ulumuddin sudah memberitahukan walahu lahir insan wabatinul insani baitu baytullahu arab asli wa allahu dzahir al insan wabathin al insanu baytullahu artinya lahiriah manusia itulah rupa hyang widi batiniah manusia itulah rumah hyang widi banyak sekali yang tertulis dalam kitab ulumuddin sehingga apabila hamba sampaikan kepada paduka kanjeng pangeran tembayat tentu bingung karena paduka tidak dapat menerima bahkan mungkin paduka mengira bahwa hamba seorang majenun demikianlah wejangan syekh siti jenar yang telah hamba terima
693522 guru hamba menguraikan asal usul manusia dengan jelas mudah diterima oleh para siswa sehingga mereka tidak menjadi bingung diwejang pula tentang ilmu yang utama yang menjelaskan tentang dan kegunaan budi dalam alam kematian di dunia ini sampai alam kehidupan di akhirat uraiannya jelas dapat dilihat dengan mata dan dibuktikan dengan nyata
693523 dalam memberikan pelajaran guru hamba syekh siti jenar tiada memakai tirai selubung tiada pula memakai lambang lambang semua penjelasan diberikan secara terbuka apa adanya dan tanpa mengharapkan apa apa sedikitpun dengan demikian musnah segala tipu muslihat kepalsuan dan segala perbuatan yang dipergunakan untuk melakukan kejahatan hal ini berbeda dengan apa yang dilakukan para guru lainnya mereka mengajarkan ilmunya secara diam diam dan berbisik bisik seolah olah menjual sesuatu yang gaib disertai dengan harapan untuk memperoleh sesuatu yang menguntungkan untuk dirinya
693524 hamba sudah berulang kali berguru serta diwejang oleh para wali mumin diberitahu akan adanya muhammad sebagai rosulullah serta allah sebagai pangeran hamba ajaran yang dituntunkan menuntun serta membuat hamba menjadi bingung dan menurut pendapat hamba ajaran mereka sukar dipahami merawak rambang tiada patokan yang dapat dijadikan dasar atau pegangan ilmu arab menjadi ilmu budha tetapi karena tidak sesuai kemudian mereka mengambil dasar dan pegangan kanjeng nabi mereka mematikan raga merantau kemana mana sambil menyiarkan agama padahal ilmu arab itu tiada kenal bertapa kecuali berpuasa pada bulan romadan yang dilakukan dengan mencegah makan tiada berharap apapun
693525 jadi jelas kalau para wali itu masih manganut agama budha buktinya mereka masih sering ketempat tempat sunyi gua gua hutan hutan gunung gunung atau tepi samudera dengan mengheningkan cipta sebagai laku demi terciptanya keinginan mereka agar dapat bertemu dengan hyang sukma itulah buktinya bahwa mereka masih dikuasai setan ijajil menurut cerita arab ambiya tiada orang yang dapat mencegah sandang pangan serta tiada untuk kuasa berjaga mencegah tidur kecuali orang budha yang mensucikan dirinya dengan jalan demikian nah silahkan memikirkan apa yang hamba katakan sebagai jawaban atas empat pertanyaan paduka
693526 syekh amongraga adalah salah seorang pewaris ajaran syekh siti jenar pada masa sultan agung hanyokusumo 1645 mengenai rincian kehidupan dan ajaran syekh amongraga dapat dibaca di serat centini
693527 saya mencari ilmu sejati yang berhubungan langsung dengan asal dan tujuan hidup dan itu saya pelajari melalui tanajjul tarki menurut saya untuk mengharapkan hidayah hanyalah bias didapat dengan kesejatian ilmu demi kesentausaan hati menggapai gejolak jiwa saya tidak ingin terjebak dalam syariat
693528 jika saya terjebak dalam syariat maka seperti burung sudah bergerak akan tetapi mendapatkan pikiran yang salah karena perbuatan salah dalam syariat adalah pada kesalahpahaman dalam memahami larangan bagi saya kesejatian ilmu itulah yang seharusnya dicari dan disesuaikan dengan ilmu kehidupan kebanyakan manusia itu jika sudah sampai pada janji maka hatinya menjadi khawatir wataknya selalu was was senantiasa takut gagal alam dibawah kolong langit diatas hamparan bumi dan semua isi didalamnya hanyalah ciptaan yang esa tidak ada keraguan lahir batin harus bulat mantap berpegang pada tekad
693529 yang membuat kita paham akan diri kita pertama tahu akan datang ajal karena itu tahu jalan kemuliaannya kedua tahu darimana asalnya ada kita ini sesungguhnya berasal dari tidak ada kehendak nya pasti jadi dan kejadian itu sendiri menjadi misal wujud mustahil pertandanya sebagai cermin yang bersih merata keseluruh alam yang pasti dzatnya kosong sekali dan tidak ada lagi dan janganlah menyombongkan diri bersikaplah menerima jika belum berhasil semua itu kehendak sang maha pencipta sebagai makhluk ciptaan manusia didunia ini hanya satu repotnya yaitu tidak berwenang berkehendak dan hanya pasrah kepada kehendak allah
693530 segala yang tercipta terdiri dari jasad dan sukma serta badan dan nyawa itulah sarana utama yakni cahaya roh dan jasad yang tidak tahu dua hal itu akan sangat menyesal hanya satu ilmunya melampaui sang utusan namun bagi yang ilmunya masih dangkal akan mustahil mencapai kebenaran dan manunggal dengan allah dalam hidup ini ia tidak bisa mengaku diri sebagai allah sukma yang maha hidup kufur jika menyebut diri sebagai allah kufur juga jika menyamakan hidupnya dengan hidup sang sukma karena sukmaitu adalah allah
693531 waktu shalat merupakan pilihan waktu yang sesungguhnya berangkat dari ilmu yang hebat mengertikah anda mengapa shalat dzuhur empat rakaat itu disebabkan kita manusia diciptakan dengan dua kaki dan dua tangan sedang shalat ashar empat rakaat juga adalah kejadian bersatunya dada dengan telaga al kautsar dengan punggung kanan dan kiri shalat maghrib itu tiga rakaat karena kita memiliki dua lubang hidung dan satu lubang mulut adapun shalat isya enjadi empat rakaat karena adanya dua telinga dan dua buah mata adapun shalat subuh mengapa dua rakaat adalah perlambang dari kejadian badan dan roh kehidupan sedangkan shalat tarawih adalah sunnah muakkad yang tidak boleh ditinggalkan dua rakaatnya oleh yang melakukan men jadi perlambang tumbuhnya alis kanan dan kiri
693532 adapun waktu yang lima bahwa masing masing berbeda beda yang memilikinya
693533 menurut pemahaman saya sesuai petunjuk syekh siti jenar dahulu anasir itu ada empat yang berupa anasir batin dan ansir lahir pertama anasir gusti perlu dipahami dengan baik dzat sifat asma dan afal perbuatan kedudukannya dalam rasa dzat maksudnya adalah bahwa diri manusia dan apapun yang kemerlap di dunia ini tidak ada yang memiliki kecuali tuhan yang maha tinggi yang besar atau yang kecil adalah milik allah semua ia tidak memiliki hidupnya sendiri hanya allah yang hidup yang tunggal adapun sifat sesungguhnya segala wujud yang kelihatan yang besar atau kecil seisi bumi dan langit tidak ada yang memiliki hanya allah tuhan yang maha agung adapun asma sesungguhnya nama semua ciptaan seluruh isi bumi adalah milik tuhan allah yang maha lebih yang maha memiliki nama sedangkan artinya afal adalah seluruh gerak dan perbuatan yang kelihatan dari seluruh makhluk isi bumi ini adalah tidak lain dari perbuatan allah yang maha tinggi demikian maksud anasir gusti
693534 anasir roh ada empat perinciannya yang berwujud ilmu yang dinamai cahaya persaksian nur syuhud maksudnya adalah sebagai berikut pertama yang disebut wujud sesungguhnya adalah hidup sejati atau amnusia sejati seperti pertempuran yang masih perawan itulah yang dimaksud badarullah yang sebenarnya kedua yang disebut ilmu adalah pengetahuan batin yang menjadi nur atau cahaya kehidupan atau roh idhafi cahaya terang menyilaukan seperti bintang kejora ketiga yang dimaksud syuhud adalah kehendak batin kejora ketiga yang dimaksud syuhud adalah kehendak batin tatkala memusatkan perhatian terutama ketika mengucapkan takbir demikianlah penjelasan tentang anasir roh percayalah kepada kecenderungan hati
693535 anasir manusia maksudnya hendaklah dipahami bahwa manusia itu terdiri dari bumi api angin dan air

693563 nicht immer f hlen sich die kleinsten in g rten wohl weil vergessen wird ihnen gartenteile abzugeben je st rker aber kinder bei kleinen wie gro en bauma nahmen oder der gartenarbeit mit eingebunden werden desto schneller wird das thema garten wichtig
693564 mit wenigen ideen ist es schon m glich kinder zu begeistern beliebt sind etwa kleine pflanznischen ob als hochbeet oder als k bel die nur von den kleinsten bepflanzt und bewirtschaftet werden hier eignen sich ganz hervorragend kleine obst oder gem sebeete auf die die nachwuchsg rtner besonders aufpassen m ssen belohnt werden sie dann mit einer reichen ernte
693565 zum beispiel kann sinnlich mit duftpflanzen die phantasie der ger che geweckt werden es gibt pflanzen die nach vanille riechen nach schokolade nach gummib ren oder mal legt einen klassischen kr utergarten an auch hier kann man ratespiele machen wichtig ist dass sich die erwachsenen vorher informieren es gibt immer auch pflanzen die nicht in kinderh nde geh ren
693566 bei wasser muss aber ganz dringend die sicherheit f r die kinder beachtet werden hier w rde ich auf die hilfe von landschaftsbauexperten setzen
693567 es k nnen auch pflanzen gepresst werden sp ter werden auch sie zu einem memory zusammengetragen man hat eine erinnerung an den ausflug und kann raten und spielen je n her man an der natur dran ist desto mehr ideen fallen einem ein ganz gleich ob als tastspiel oder beobachtungsspiel

693576 semua ajaran yang disampaikan ki ageng pengging meyakinkan jelas teratur dan terus terang tiada yang dirahasiakan tanpa tedeng aling aling tiada pula selamatan atau sajian kepada rosul bahkan kain putih saja tidak diperlukan siapa saja yang datang diberi pengetahuan ilmu tentang rahasia alam semesta tiada bersyahadat tiada berdzikir mengajarkan tentang kenyataan dari ajal hidup di dunia dipakai sebagai contoh perumpamaannya di dunia ini kepercayaan didesak oleh syahadat serta dipalsukan dengan perumpamaan ilmu gaib yang kosong berdzikir dan sembahyang dipakai sebagai kedok penipuan seperti yang diajarkan para sahabat waliullah
693577 manusia yang sejati itu ialah ia yang mempunyai hak dan kekuasaan tuhan yang maha kuasa serta berdiri mandiri diri pribadi sebagai hamba ia menjadi sukma sedang hyang sukma menjadi nyawa hilangnya nyawa bersatu padu dengan hampa dan kehampaan ini meliputi alam semesta
693578 adanya allah karena dzikir sebab dengan berdzikir orang menjadi tidak tahu akan adanya zat dan sifat sifatnya nama untuk menyebut hyang manon yaitu yang maha tahu menyatukan diri hingga lenyap dan terasa dalam pribadi ya dia ya saya maka di dalam hati timbul gagasan bahwa ia yang berdzikir menjadi zat yang mulia dalam alam kelanggengan yang masih di dunia ini di manapun sama saja hanya manusia yang ada allah yang dirasakan adanya waktu orang berdzikir tidak ada jadi gagasan yang palsu sebab pada hakikatnya adanya allah yang demikian itu hanya karena nama saja
693579 manusia yang melebihi sesamanya memiliki duapuluh sifat sehingga dalam hal ini antara agama hindu budha jawa dan islam sudah campur di samping itu rupa dan nama sudah bersatu jadi tiada kesukaran lagi untuk mengerti akan hal ini dan semuanya sangat mudah dipahami
693580 manusia hidup dalam alam dunia ini hanya menghadapi dua masalah yang saling berpasangan yaitu baik buruk berpasangan dengan kamu hidup berjodoh dengan mati tuhan berhadapan dengan hamba nya
693581 orang hidup tiada merasakan ajal orang berbuat baik tiada merasakan berbuat buruk dan jiwa luhur tiada bertempat tinggal demikianlah pengetahuan yang bijaksana yang meliputi cakrawala kehidupan yang tiada berusaha mencari kemuliaan kematian hidup terserah kehendak orang masing masing
693582 menurut ajaran siti jenar dulu keadaan hidup itu berupa bumi angkasa samudera dan gunung seisinya semua yang tumbuh di dunia udara dan angin yang tersebar di mana mana matahari dan bulan menyusup di langit dan keberadaan manusia sebagai makhluk yang terutama
693583 allah bukan johar manik yaitu ratna mutu manikam bukan jenazah dan bukan rahasia yang gaib syahadat itu kepalsuan
693584 akhirat itu di dunia ini tempatnya hidup dan matipun hanya di dunia ini
693585 bayi itu berasal dari desakan setelah menjadi tua menuruti kawan karena terbiasa waktu kanak kanak berkumpul dengan anak setelah tuapun berkumpul dengan orang orang tua berbincang bincanglah mereka tentang nama yang sunyi hampa saling bohong membohongi meskipun sifat sifat dan wujud mereka bicarakan itu tidak mereka ketahui
693586 saya di sini membuka hutan bercocok tanam di huma untuk penghidupan atas kehendak hyang manon yang maha tahu jika tanaman saya memberi hasil jagung kentang dan ketela saya makan bersama hyang agung yang maha agung yang memberi perintah kepada saya
693587 tatkala saya mencangkul saya bersama gusti tuhan ketika saya mengambil hasil cocok tanaman saya saya bersama pengeran tuhan sekarang ada sesama orang memanggil saya ke bintara di sini ada apa selain pangeran dengan nama nya yang serambutpun tiada terpisahkan
693588 jika saya dipanggil ke demak sesungguhnya saya menolak tidak mau jika tidak bersama dengan yang mengasuh jiwa raga saya sekalipun saya mau akan tetapi yang maha kuasa tidak mau bagaimana saya dapat berjalan
693589 takdir tiada kenal mundur sebab semuanya itu ada dalam kekuasaan yang murba wasesa yang menguasai segala kejadian
693590 orang mati tiada merasa sakit yang merasa sakit itu hidup yang masih mandiri dalam raga apabila jiwa saya selesai menjalankan tugasnya dia akan kembali ke alam aning anung alam yang tenteram bahagia aman damai dan abadi oleh karena itu saya tidak takut akan bahaya apapun
693591 menurut pendapat saya yang disebut ilmu itu ialah segala sesuatu yang tidak kelihatan oleh mata umpamanya demak dari sini tidak tampak akan tetapi demak itu ada itulah yang disebut ilmu adapun pernyataan yang kedua di mana tempat hidup itu jawabannya hidup itu uninong ananung pertanyaan yang ketiga siapa yang mengajak tidur jawabannya menurut saya yang mengajak tidur itu tirta nirmaya
693592 yaitu air hayat kata arabnya air hidup itulah yang dulu dicari sang sena dan disebut air prawita dalam bahasa hindu budha adapun tempatnya di uning unong uninong aning
693593 sesungguhnyalah saya ini orang mati setiap hari kematian saya berkurang berapa lamakah kiranya saya mati di dunia ini masih lama lagi hidup saya nanti saya tentu kembali hidup mati kaya akan dosa dan siksaan neraka yang banyak saya alami ini balik kalao besok apabila saya sudah hidup tiada terhitung kebahagiaan yang saya alami langgeng untuk selama lamanya
693594 yang mengatakan sekarang hidup besok disebut mati itu ucapan santri yang terkutuk ma buk tobat mengharap harapkan sesuatu yang belum pasti
693595 mana ada hyang mahasuci baik di dunia maupun di akhirat sunyi yang ada saya pribadi sesungguhnya besok saya hidup seorang diri tanpa kawan di situlah dzatullahu mesra bersatu menjadi saya
693596 karena saya di dunia ini mati luar dalam saya sekarang ini yang di dalam hidupku besok yang di luar kematianku sekarang
693597 orang yang ingin pulang ke alam kehidupan tidak sukar lebih lebih bagi murid syekh siti jenar sebab ia sudah paham dan menguasai sebelumnya di sini di tahu rasanya di sana di sana ia tahu rasanya di sini
693598 yang disebut mati itu keinginan pribadi perihal pulangnya syekh siti jenar ke alam kehidupan saya bermaksud menyusulnya hidup bersama dia dalam alam yang tiada terbayangkan sebentarlagi saya akan pulang
693599 tiada bimbang akan manunggalnya sukma sukma dalam keheningan tersimpan hati sanubari terbukalah tirai tal lain antara sadar dan tidur ibarat keluar dari mimpi menyusui rasa jati

693607 pernyataan roh yg bertemu hadapan dgn allah yg menyembah allah yg disembah allah yg meliputi segala sesuatu
693608 hidup itu bersifat baru dan dilengkapi dengan pancaindera pancaindera ini merupakan barang pinjaman yg jika sudah diminta oleh yg empunya akan menjadi tanah dan membusuk hancur lebur bersifat najis oleh karena itu pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pedoman hidup demikian pula budi pikiran angan angan dan kesadaran berasal dari pancaindera tidak dapat dipakai sebagai pegangan hidup akal dapat menjadi gila sedih bingung lupa tidur dan seringkali tidak jujur akal itu pula yg siang malam mengajak dengki bahkan merusak kebahagiaan orang lain dengki dapat pula menuju perbuatan jahat menimbulkan kesombongan untuk akhirnya jatuh dalam lembah kenistaan sehingga menodai nama dan citranya kalau sudah sampai sedemikian jauhnya baru orang menyesalkan perbuatannya
693609 apakah tidak tahu bahwa penampilan bentuk daging urat tulang sunsum bisa rusak dan bagaimana cara anda memperbaikinya biarpun bersembahyang seribu kali setiap harinya akhirnya mati juga meskipun badan anda anda tutupi akhirnya menjadi debu juga tetapi jika penampilan bentuknya seperti tuhan apakah para wali dapat membawa pulang dagingnya saya rasa tidak dapat alam semesta ini baru tuhan tidak akan membentuk dunia ini dua kali dan juga tidak akan membuat tatanan batu dalilnya layabtakiru hilamuhdil yg artinya tidak membuat sesuatu wujud lagi tentang terjadinya alam semesta sesudah dia membuat dunia
693610 segala sesuatu yg terjadi di alam semesta ini pada hakikatnya adalah afal perbuatan allah berbagai hal yg dinilai baik maupun buruk pada hakikatnya adalah dari allah juga jadi keliru dan sesat pandangan yg mengatakan bahwa yg baik dari allah dan yg buruk dari selain allah
693611 afal allah harus dipahami dari dalam dan dari luar diri
693612 di dunia ini kita merupakan mayat mayat yg cepat juga akan menjadi busuk dan bercampur tanah ketahuilah juga apa yg dinamakan kawula gusti tidak berkaitan dgn seorang manusia biasa seperti yg lain lain kawula dan gusti itu sudah ada dalam diriku siang dan malam tidak dapat memisahkan diriku dari mereka tetapi hanya untuk saat ini nama kawula gusti itu berlaku yakni selama saya mati nanti kalau saya sudah hidup lagi gusti dan kawula lenyap yg tinggal hanya hidupku sendiri ketentraman langgeng dalam ada sendiri bila kau belum menyadari kebenaran kata kataku maka dgn tepat dapat dikatakan bahwa kau masih terbenam dalam masa kematian di sini memang terdapat banyak hiburan aneka warna lebih banyak lagi hal hal yg menimbulkan hawa nafsu tetapi kau tidak melihat bahwa itu hanya akibat pancaindera itu hanya impian yg sama sekali tidak mengandung kebenaran dan sebentar lagi akan cepat lenyap gilalah orang yg terikat padanya saya tidak merasa tertarik tak sudi tersesat dalam kerajaan kematian satu satunya yg kuusahakan ialah kembali kepada kehidupan
693613 inna al janatu wa al naru qathun an al ana
693614 syahadat shalat dan puasa itu sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan jadi tidak perlu adapun zakat dan naik haji ke makah itu semua omong kosong palson kabeh itu seluruhnya kedurjanaan budi penipuan terhadap sesama manusia orang orang dungu yg menuruti aulia karena diberi harapan surga di kelak kemudian hari itu sesungguhnya keduanya orang yang tidak tahu lain halnya dengan saya siti jenar
693615 tiada pernah saya menuruti perintah budi bersujud sujud di mesjid mengenakan jubah pahalanya besok saja bila dahi sudah menjadi tebal kepala berbelulang sesungguhnya hal ini idak masuk akal di dunia ini semua manusia adalah sama mereka semua mengalami suka duka menderita sakit dan duka nestapa tiada beda satu dengan yang lain oleh karena itu saya siti jenar hanya setia pada satu hal saja yaitu gusti zat maulana
693616 itulah yang dianggap syekh siti jenar hyang widi ia berbuat baik dan menyembah atas kehendak nya tekad lahiriahnya dihapus tingkah lakunya mirip dengan pendapat yg ia lahirkan ia berketetapan hati untuk berkiblat dan setia teguh dalam pendiriannya kukuh menyucikan diri dari segala yg kotor untuk sampai menemui ajalnya tidak menyembah kepada budi dan cipta syekh siti jenar berpendapat dan menggangap dirinya bersifat muhammad yaitu sifat rasul yg sejati sifat muhammad yg kudus
693617 gusti zat maulana dialah yg luhur dan sangat sakti yg berkuasa maha besar lagipula memiliki dua puluh sifat kuasa atas kehendak nya dialah yg maha kuasa pangkal mula segala ilmu maha mulia maha indah maha sempurna maha kuasa rupa warna nya tanpa cacat seperti hamba nya di dalam raga manusia ia tiada nampak ia sangat sakti menguasai segala yg terjadi dan menjelajahi seluruh alam semesta ngidraloka
693618 hyang widi wujud yg tak nampak oleh mata mirip dengan ia sendiri sifat sifatnya mempunyai wujud seperti penampakan raga yg tiada tampak warnanya melambangkan keselamatan tetapi tanpa cahaya atau teja halus lurus terus menerus menggambarkan kenyataan tiada berdusta ibaratnya kekal tiada bermula sifat dahulu yg meniadakan permulaan karena asal dari diri pribadi
693619 sesungguhnya khidir as bukanlah sosok lain yg terpisah sama sekali dari keberadaan manusia rohani apa yg disaksikan sebagai tanah menjorok dgn lautan di sebelah kanan dan kiri itu bukanlah suatu tempat yg berada di luar diri manusia tanah itulah yg disebut perbatasan barzakh dua lautan itu adalah lautan makna bahr perlambang alam tidak kasatmata alam al ghaib dan lautan jisim bahr al ajsam perlambang alam kasatmata alam asy syahadat
693620 sedangkan kawanan udang adalah perlambang para pencari kebenaran yg sudah berenang di perbatasan alam kasatmata san alam tidak kasatmata kawanan udang perlambang para penempuh jalan rohani salik yg benar benar bertujuan mencari kebenaran sementara itu kawanan udang yg berenang di lautan sebelah kiri di antara batu batu merupakan perlambang para salik yg penuh diliputi hasrat hasrat dan pamrih pamrih duniawi
693621 sesungguhnya peristiwa yg dialami nabi musa as dgn khidir as sebagaimana termaktub di dalam al karim bukanlah hanya peristiwa sejarah seorang manusia bertemu manusia lain ia adalah peristiwa perjalanan rohani yg berlangsung di dalam diri nabi musa as sendiri sebagaimana yg telah saya jelaskan yg disebut dua lautan di dalam tidak lain dan tidak bukan adalah lautan makna bahr dan lautan jisim bahr al ajsam kedua lautan itu dipisahkan oleh wilayah perbatasan atau sekat barzakh
693622 ikan dan lautan dalam kisah qurani itu merupakan perlambang dunia kasatmata alam asy syahadat yg berbeda dengan wilayah perbatasan yg berdampingan dgn dunia gaib alam al ghaib maksudnya jika saat itu nabi musa as melihat ikan dan kehidupan yg melingkupi ikan tersebut dari tempatnya berdiri yaitu di wilayah perbatasan antara dua lautan maka nabi musa as akan melihat sang ikan berenang di dalalm alamnya yaiu lautan jika saat itu nabi musa as mencermati maka ia akan dapat menyaksikan bahwa sang ikan yg berenang itu dapat melihat segala sesuatu di dalam lautan kecuali air dilambangkan manusia juga sama maknanya sang ikan hidup di dalam air dan sekaligus di dalam tubuh ikan ada air tetapi ia tidak bisa melihat iar dan tidak sadar jika dirinya hidup di dalam air itulah sebabnya ikan tidak dapat hidup tanpa air yg meliputi bagian luar dan bagian dalam tubuhnya di mana pun ikan berada ia akan selalu diliputi air yg tak bisa dilihatnya
693623 sementara itu seandainya sang ikan di dalam lautan melihat nabi musa as dari tempat hidupnya di dalam air lautan maka sang ikan akan berkata bahwa musa as di dalam dunia yang diliputi udara kosong dapat menyaksikan segala sesuatu kecuali udara kosong yg meliputinya itu maknanya nabi musa as hidup di dalam liputan udara kosong yg ada di luar maupun di dalam tubuhnya tetapi ia tidak bisa melihat udara kosong dan tidak sadar jika dirinya hidup di dalam udara kosong itu sebabnya nabi musa as tidak dapat hidup tanpa udara kosong yg meliputi bagian luar dan dalam tubuhnya di mana pun nabi musa as berada ia akan selalu diliputi udara kosong yg tidak bisa dilihatnya
693624 sesungguhnya pemuda al fata yg mendampingi nabi musa as dan membawakan bekal makanan adalah perlambang dari terbukanya pintu alam tidak kasatmata sesungguhnya dibalik keberadaan pemuda al fata itu tersembunyi hakikat sang pembuka al fattah sebab hijab gaib yg menyelubungi manusia dari kebenaran sejati tidak akan bisa dibuka tanpa kehendak dia sang pembuka al fattah itu sebabnya saat nabi musa as bertemu dgn khidir as pemuda al fata itu disebut sebut lagi karena ia sejatinya merupakan perlambang keterbukaan hijab ghaib
693625 adapun bekal makanan yg berupa ikan adalah perlambang pahala perbuatan baik al amal ash shalih yg hanya berguna untuk bekal menuju ke taman surgawi al jannah namun bagi pencari kebenaran sejati pahala perbuatan baik itu justru mempertebal gumpalan kabut penutup hati ghain itu sebabnya sang pemuda mengaku dibuat lupa oleh setan hingga ikan bekalnya masuk ke dalam lautan
693626 andaikata saat itu nabi musa as memerintahkan si pemuda untuk mencari bekal yg lain apalagi sampai memburu bekal ikan yg telah masuk ke dalam laut niscaya nabi musa as dan si pemuda tentu akan masuk ke lautan jisim bahr al ajsam kembali dan jika itu terjadi maka setan berhasil memperdaya nabi musa as
693627 ternyata nabi musa as tidak peduli dgn bekal itu ia justru menyatakan bahwa tempat di mana ikan itu melompat ke lautan adalah tempat yg dicarinya sehingga tersingkaplah gumpalan kabut ghain dari kesadaran nabi musa as saat itulah purnama rohani zawaid berkilau dan nabi musa as dapat melihat khidir as hamba yg dilimpahi rahmat dan kasih sayang rahmah al khashshah yg memancar dari citra ar rahman dan ar rahim dan ilmu ilahi ilm ladunni yg memancar dari sang pengetahuan al alim
693628 anugerah ilahi dilimpahkan kepada khidir as karena dia merupakan hamba nya yg telah mereguk air kehidupan ma al hayat yg memancar dari sang hidup al hayy
693629 demikianlah saat sang salik melihat khidir as sesungguhnya ia telah menyaksikan ar roh al idhafi mursyid sejati di dalam diri manusia sendiri saat ia menyaksikan kawanan udang di lautan sebelah kanan sesungguhnya ia telah menyaksikan lautan makna yg merupakan hamparan permukaan lautan wujud bahr al wujud namun jika terputus penglihatan batiin bashirab itu pada titik ini berarti perjalanan menusia itu menuju ke kebenaran sejati masih akan berlanjut
693630 setelah berada di wilayah perbatasan khidir as dan nabi musa as digambarkan melanjutkan perjalanan memasuki lautan makna yaitu alam tidak kasatmata mereka kemudian digambarkan menumpang perahu sesungguhnya perahu yg mereka gunakan untuk menyeberang itu adalah perlambang dari wahana syariah yg lazimnya digunakan oleh kalangan awam untuk mencari ikan yakni perlambang perbuatan baik al amal ash shalih padahal perjalanan mengarungi lautan makna menuju kebenaran sejati adalah perjalanan yg sangat pribadi menuju lautan wujud itulah sebabnya perahu syariah itu harus dilubangi agar air dari lautan makna masuk ke dalam perahu dan penumpang perahu mengenal hakikat air yg mengalir dari lubang tersebut
693631 setelah penumpang perahu mengenal air yg mengalir dari lubang maka ia akan menjadi sadar bahwa lewat lubang itulah sesungguhnya ia akan bisa masuk ke dalam lautan makna yg merupakan permukaan lautan wujud andaikata perahu itu tidak dilubangi dan kemudian perahu diteruskan berlayar maka perahu itu tentu akan dirampas oleh sang maha raja malik al mulki sehingga penumpangnya akan menjadi tawanan jika sudah demikian maka untuk selamanya sang penumpang perahu tidak bisa melanjutkan perjalanan menuju dia yang maha ada al wujud yg bersemayam di segenap penjuru hamparan lautan wujud penumpang perahu itu mengalami nasib seperti penumpang perahu yg lain yakni akan dijadikan hamba sahaya oleh sang maha raja bahkan jika sang maha raja menyukai hamba sahaya nya itu maka ia akan diangkat sebagai penghuni taman jannah indah yg merupakan pengejawantahan yang maha indah al jamal
693632 adapun atas pernyataan kenapa wahana syariah harus dilubangi dan tidak lagi digunakan dalam perjalanan menembus alam ghaib manuju dia dapat dijelaskan sebagai berikut
693633 sebab wahana adalah kendaraan bagi manusia yg hidup di alam kasatmata untuk pedoman menuju ke taman surgawi sedangkan alam tidak kasatmata adalah alam yg tidak jelas batas batasnya alam yg tidak bisa dinalar karena segala kekuatan akal manusia mengikat itu tidak bisa berijtihad untuk menetapkan hukum yg berlaku di alam gaib itu sebabnya khidir as melarang nabi musa as bertanya sesuatu dgn akalnya dalam perjalanan tersebut dan apa yg disaksikan nabi musa as terdapat perbuatan yg dilakukan khidir as benar benar bertentangan dgn hukum suci syariat dan akal sehat yg berlaku di dunia yakni melubangi perahu tanpa alasan membunuh seorang anak kecil tak bersalah dan menegakkan tembok runtuh tanpa upah
693634 namun jika wahana syariah tidak lagi bisa dijadikan petunjuk sebenarnya pedomannya tetaplah sama yaitu kitabullah dan sunnah rasul tetapi pemahamannya bukan dgn akal aql melainkan dgn dzauq yaitu cita rasa rohani inilah yg disebut cara thariqah di sini sang salik selain harus berjuang keras juga harus pasrah kepada kehendak nya sebab telah termaktub dalam dalil araftu rabbi bi rabbi bahwa kita hanya mengenal dia dgn dia maksudnya jika tuhan tidak berkehendak kita mengenal nya maka kita pun tidak akan bisa mengenal nya dan kita mengenal nya pun maka hanya melalui dia walaupun kita tidak mau tetapi semua telah kehendak nya itu sebabnya di alam tidak kasatmata yg tidak jelas batas dan tanda tandanya itu kita tidak dapat berbuat sesuatu kecuali pasrah seutuhnya dan mengharap limpahan rahmat dan hidayah nya
693635 tentang makna di balik kisah khidir as membunuh seorang anak ghulam dapat saya jelaskan sebagai berikut
693636 anak adalah perlambang keakuan kerdil yg kekanak kanakan kedewasaan rohani seorang yg teguh imannya bisa runtuh akibat terseret cinta kepada keakuan kerdil yg kekanak kanakan tersebut itu sebabnya keakuan kerdil y kekanak kanakan itu harus dibunuh agar kedewasaan rohani tidak terganggu
693637 sesungguhnya di dalam perjalanan rohani menuju kebenaran sejati selalu terjadi keadaan di mana keakuan kerdil yg kekank kanakan ghulam dari salik cenderung mengikari kehambaan dirinya terhadap cahaya yang terpuji nur muhammad sebagai akibat ia belum fana ke dalam sang rasul fana fi rasul
693638 sesungguhnya keakuan kerdil yg kekanak kanakan adalah perlambang dari keberadaan nafsu manusia yg cenderung durhaka dan ingkar terhadap sumbernya sedangkan ghulam yg baik dan berbakti merupakan perlambang dari keberadaan roh manusia yg cenderung setia dan berbakti kepada sumbernya dan sesungguhnya perbuatan khidir as itu adalah perlambang yg sama saat nabi ibrahim as akan menyembelih nabi ismail as pembuhunan itu adalah perlambang puncak dari keimanan mereka yg beriman mumin
693639 adapun dinding yg ditinggikan khidir as adalah perlambang sekat tertinggi al barzakh al ala yg disebut juga dgn hijab yang maha pemurah hajib ar rahman dinding itu adalah pengejawantahan yang maha luhur al jalil lantaran itu dinding tersebut dinamakan dinding al jalal al jidar al jalal yg dibawahnya tersimpan khazanah perbendaharaan tahta al kanz yg ingin diketahui
693640 sedangkan dua anak yatim ghulamaini yatimaini pewaris dinding itu adalah perlambang jati diri nabi musa as yg keberadaannya terbentuk atas jasad ragwi al basyar dan rohani roh kegandaan jati diri manusia itu baru tersingkap jika seseorang sudah berada dalam keadaan tidak memiliki apa apa muflis terkucil sendiri mufrad dan telah berada di dalam waktu tak berwaktu ibn al waqt dua anak yatim itu adalah perlambang gambaran nabi musa as dan bayangannya di depan cermin memalukan
693641 adapun gambaran tentang ayah yg salih dari kedua anak yatim yakni ayah yg mewariskan khazanah perbendaharaan adalah perlambang diri dari abu halih sang pembuka hikmah al hikmah al futuhiyyah yakni pengejawantahan sang pembuka dengan demikian apa yg telah dialami nabi musa as dalam perjalanan bersama khidir as qs al kahfi 60 82 menurut penafsiran adalah perjalanan rohani nabi musa as ke dalam dirinya sendiri yg penuh dgn perlambang isyarat
693642 memang nabi musa as lahir hanya satu namun keberadaan jati dirinya sesungguhnya adalah dua yaitu pertama keberadaan sebagai al basyar anak adam as yg berasal dari anasir tanah yg tercipta dan keberadaannya sebagai roh anak cahaya yang terpuji nur muhammad yg berasal dari tiupan nafakhtu cahaya di atas cahaya nurun ala nurin maksudnya sebagai al basyar keberadaan jasad ragawi nabi musa as berasal dari yang mencipta al kha liq
693643 sehingga tidak akan pernah terjadi perseteruan dalam memperebutkan khazanah perbendaharaan warisan ayahnya yg shalih sebab saat keduanya berdiri berhadap hadapan di depan dinding al jalal al jidar al jalal dan mendapati dinding itu runtuh maka saat itu yg ada hanya satu anak yatim maksudnya saat itu keberadaan al basyar anak adam as akan terserap ke dalam roh anak nur muhammad saat itulah sang anak sadar bahwa ia sejatinya berasal dari cahaya di atas cahaya nurun ala nurin yg merupakan pancaran dari khazanah perbendaharaan sesungguhnya hal semacam itu tidak bisa diuraikan dgn kaidah kaidah nalar manusia karena akan membawa kesesatan jadi harus dijalani dan dialami sendiri sebagai sebuah pengalaman pribadi
693644 i am a lifelong fan of the nfl and became a patriots fan in 1960 when the team was founded and in 1971 i became a season ticket holder and have enjoyed attending nearly every patriots game with my family of all the players i watched and rooted for during that time i can say without a doubt that andre tippett was the most dominant defender the patriots have ever had and one of the greatest to ever play the game andre possessed the perfect combination of strength speed and athleticism in his prime andre was probably the most intimidating player in the game i cant think of a higher compliment for a linebacker

693712 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
693713 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
693714 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

693752 if i were in canada i would be hopping mad about the lack of ability to crack down on these corrupt people who are involved in this trade and on the farmers who are growing the opium
693753 they are clearly financing the people who are attacking your troops attacking the british troops in helmand province and attacking the americans throughout as well
693754 his power base is in helmand and kandahar provinces thats where 70 to 80 per cent of the opium is grown and he does not want to crack down on the people there because he needs their support for reelection
693755 look we cannot support your government anymore if youre protecting narco traffickers
693756 you karzai need to hit the trade at all levels
693757 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with the problem
693758 i know that canada is prepared to set up and be part of the solution does it necessarily mean going out and burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
693759 it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build democracy in afghanistan

693841 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
693842 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
693843 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
693844 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
693845 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
693846 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
693847 the class ix student identified as rituraj dixit 14 admitted of killing ram krishna yadav and vedant manmodhe in the hostels bathroom
693848 ram was killed on july 29 while vedant was murdered on july 31 by rituraj who after calling the minors to the toilet on the pretext of giving them chocolates took their lives by gagging them
693849 we prepared well for this game it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
693850 that happens when the tide turns and the pressure builds and they are prepared to take a bit of a risk to profit and it snowballed on us without a doubt
693851 you can poke a stick at a number of things for example you might suggest we made a sub too early but when you are under the hammer youve got to try to do something
693852 so you throw the rope and you give things a go it didnt work and it wont be the last time
693853 they were going forward often so they tended to thrive
693854 they fed off the excitement of going forward they grew an arm and a leg and they grew in confidence and they gave things a crack
693855 we did score first but we didnt build any pressure
693856 it was disappointing but do not dwell on it move on

693863 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
693864 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
693865 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
693866 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
693867 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

693879 debbie will you recommend a book that will tell me exactly what i need to do and say to set boundaries at home
693880 looking forward to it hope you will address relationships for singles too how do we find a companion who is worthy of our love without getting dud after dud and how do we stop abuse from going on too long how do we even know we are being abused in our relationships
693881 im interested in learning how to set boundaries around family members who may be engaging in behaviors that are unacceptable to me i would also benefit from advice on ways to calmly respond to upset responses to setting boundaries
693882 i am basically a people pleaser so setting boundaries has been a little difficult for me i am ready for peace in my life with boundaries
693883 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
693884 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
693885 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
693886 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
693887 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
693888 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
693889 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
693890 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
693891 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
693892 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
693893 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
693894 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
693895 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
693896 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
693897 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
693898 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
693899 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
693900 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
693901 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
693902 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
693903 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
693904 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
693905 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
693906 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
693907 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
693908 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
693909 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
693910 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
693911 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
693912 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
693913 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
693914 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
693915 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
693916 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
693917 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
693918 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
693919 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
693920 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
693921 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
693922 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

693926 our stance in the negotiations underway with the american side will be strong we will not accept any memorandum of understanding that doesnt have specific dates to withdraw foreign forces from iraq
693927 this is what the iraqi people want the parliament and other iraqi leaders
693928 not for the first time a court ruling in a copyright policy case has made privacy rights an afterthought last week u s district court judge louis l stanton ruled that
693929 and thats that thats what they will spend endless dollars on their secrecy their rights make no mistake
693930 judge stanton had no problem protecting googles own intellectual property rejecting viacoms demands for access to the source code behind much of youtubes operations but he blandly dismissed googles defense of youtube users privacy in a brief paragraph of

693943 i had to lift the lid to look inside and i just got walloped
693944 i could be dead its as simple as that if it was a little old lady i dont think they would have taken the shock
693945 she said she hadnt told me to touch it but how else could i find out
693946 then she said i accused her of trying to kill me and she hung up on me
693947 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
693948 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
693949 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
693950 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
693951 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past
693952 its time to take the handbrake off its time to turn the growth engine on
693953 as i said to you there will be modest changes to kiwisaver and well detail those quite soon
693954 we paid the bills for think big for a very long time
693955 i think its reckless and i think its gambling with the future i cannot think of anything crazier right now when world financial markets are in turmoil than to have a party like the national party go out to the people and say lets borrow more money
693956 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
693957 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
693958 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
693959 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
693960 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
693961 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
693962 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
693963 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
693964 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
693965 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
693966 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
693967 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
693968 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
693969 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
693970 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
693971 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
693972 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

693977 this regulatory change would encourage broad debate and participation in the directors elections by removing the current 10 000 spending restriction on advertising expenses in place for third party intervenors and allowing third parties to freely disseminate information during the election period
693978 it is good to see people getting interested in history and heritage
693979 the church of the assumption with its unique piped organ music playing and church bells ringing had enliven the hearts of the parishioners for ages
693980 certainly we feel proud that this church had been listed as one of unescos world heritage site
693981 it is my hope and desire that the state government will assist us to maintain the building and the public works department to conduct check on the building now and then
693982 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
693983 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
693984 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
693985 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
693986 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
693987 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
693988 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
693989 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
693990 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
693991 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
693992 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
693993 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
693994 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
693995 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
693996 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
693997 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
693998 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
693999 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
694000 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
694001 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is
694002 and then they should tell them with confidence that they have it if they want
694003 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
694004 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
694005 it was really tough to try to decide who was who and who should we hit
694006 i know at times we were ordered to strafe refugees in fact i pulled fighters off refugees at times
694007 that was a typical observation for a pilot and observer
694008 it was hell how could they not tell civilians from north korean troops
694009 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
694010 the u s military hardly took into consideration a risk that its massive bombing and incineration operations could take heavy tolls on civilians
694011 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
694012 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go
694013 and then the fire incinerated everything and spread into the cave
694014 his bowels spilled out his mother fell down and cried over his body in the shower of bullets
694015 for years when it rained water flooding out of the cave carried the bones away
694016 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
694017 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
694018 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
694019 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
694020 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
694021 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
694022 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
694023 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
694024 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
694025 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
694026 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
694027 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
694028 it undoes the past in the present and thus releases the future
694029 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
694030 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
694031 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
694032 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
694033 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
694034 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
694035 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
694036 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
694037 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
694038 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
694039 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
694040 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
694041 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
694042 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
694043 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
694044 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
694045 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others

694055 for the first time in about almost 30 years weve seen a large number of african countries that have begun to show sustained economic growth at rates that are similar to those in the rest of the developing world and actually today exceed the rate of growth in most of the advanced economies
694056 africa has learnt to trade more effectively with the rest of the world to rely more on the private sector and to avoid the very serious collapses in economic growth that characterized the 1970s 1980s and even the early 1990s
694057 perhaps the easiest illustration of that is in the resource rich economies where the resources often accrue to a small number of corporations and to government

694201 einige leute d rften gesagt haben dass sie nicht glauben dass ferrari heute das potenzial zum gewinnen hat aber felipe f hrte das rennen an und du stehst auf dem podium hattest du w hrend des wochenendes zuversicht versp rt
694202 wir hatten die ganze zeit ber ein ziemlich schnelles auto felipe hatte heute sehr viel pech f r mich selbst war es ein ziemlich entt uschendes wochenende aber schlussendlich erzielten wir ein ziemlich gutes ergebnis wir haben im rennen die geschwindigkeit aber wenn man sich nicht qualifizieren kann dann k nnen wir diese nicht nutzen das haben wir heute erneut gesehen
694203 den gro teil des rennens ber hing ich hinter alonso fest und als ich erst einmal alleine fuhr konnte ich um fast eine sekunde schneller fahren wir m ssen dieses problem beheben an die spitze kommen und dann k nnen wir mit sicherheit um siege k mpfen das auto scheint gut zu funktionieren wir m ssen einfach wieder ein gutes setup finden es war in den vergangenen paar rennen f r mich etwas schwierig aber wir befinden uns noch im kampf um die meisterschaft es ist also nicht allzu schlecht
694204 welche mitteilungen hast du vor dem letzten entscheidenden boxenstopp erhalten
694205 meiner meinung nach h tten wir zu beginn des rennens damit etwas besser umgehen k nnen aber wir dachten dass es eng werden w rde und wir wom glich in derselben runde an die box kommen und ich kam gerade vor dem boxenstopp etwas neben die strecke gl cklicherweise kam alonso eine runde fr her an die box und ich konnte in der runde an die box sehr schnell fahren
694206 das problem war jedoch dass ich etwas zur ck fiel als ich den fehler machte ich war jedoch schnell genug um vor ihn zu kommen wir hatten einen sehr guten boxenstopp das war der gro e schl sselmoment und dann war ich schnell genug um auf timo aufzuholen musste dann jedoch langsamer machen
694207 es war die ganze zeit ber gut aber wie es auf den harten reifen war ist schwierig zu sagen die runde an die box war sehr gut aber ich lag die ganze zeit ber rund eine sekunde hinter alonso man bekommt also eine falsche vorstellung vom auto und kann die geschwindigkeit nicht nutzen als ich alleine fuhr war das auto schnell wir m ssen also einfach an die spitze auf den ersten platz kommen um die geschwindigkeit zu nutzen
694208 ich sah wie er leider auf der geraden anhielt ich wei nicht was passierte aber sie sagten mir dass es wom glich etwas mit dem motor zu tun hat sie sagten aus diesem grund zu mir dass ich es ein wenig lockerer angehen soll
694209 hat die extreme hitze heute die leistung der strecke gest rt
694210 es war in ordnung f r die autos ist es h rter f r alle aber das war kein problem
694211 gab es eine warnung vor einem spezifischen risiko an deinem auto dass etwas nicht richtig funktioniert oder hast du dich entschieden einfach als vorsichtsma nahme langsamer zu machen
694212 lass es mich so sagen ich habe einfach langsamer gemacht
694213 mit sicherheit war dies kein wochenende wie ich es mir erhofft hatte
694214 wie f hlst du dich denn bis 20 runden vor dem ende war es ein schlechtes wochenende nun bist du der kerl der ersten drei in der gesamtwertung der mehr punkte geholt hat als die anderen beiden
694215 mit sicherheit war dies kein wochenende wie ich es mir erhofft hatte wir hatten im rennen eine gute geschwindigkeit aber ich leistete mir im qualifying einen fehler und ohne diesen h tten wir uns zun chst einmal in einer anderen position befunden aber das problem scheint im qualifying zu liegen
694216 die geschwindigkeit ist vorhanden wenn wir erst einmal an die spitze kommen aber wenn wir nicht dort liegen dann k nnen wir sie nicht nutzen als ich alleine fuhr war es sofort gut aber wenn man sich alles anschaut die ganzen probleme dass ich das ganze rennen ber hinter anderen autos hing und nun dritter wurde und mehr punkte geholt habe als die jungs vor mir dann ist das kein schlechtes ergebnis ich nehme es so wie es kommt
694217 es sind noch viele rennen zu fahren wir sind in der meisterschaft bei der musik
694218 wir werden sehen wie wir die probleme f r das kommende rennen in den griff bekommen werden und werden sehen ob wir st rker sind und um den sieg k mpfen k nnen es sind noch viele rennen zu fahren wir sind in der meisterschaft bei der musik ich mache mir also nicht allzu viele sorgen es wird sch n sein in ferien zu gehen
694219 und das mechanische problem das du am ende des rennen hattest k nnte dies das kommende rennen behindern
694220 wie entscheidend ist deiner meinung nach das qualifying problem im hinblick auf die meisterschaft
694221 es hat mich heute wirklich nicht allzu sehr beeinflusst mit sicherheit h tten wir um den sieg k mpfen k nnen aber zumindest haben wir heute ein paar ordentliche punkte geholt es geht haupts chlich darum das auto dort hinzubekommen wo wir es haben wollen
694222 man kann gut sehen dass es im rennen kein problem ist aber mit den neuen reifen ist es ein wenig dasselbe problem wie im vergangenen jahr dass es schwierig zu sein scheint eine runde aus ihnen heraus zu holen und auf dem kurs zu bleiben ich denke dass es rennen geben wird die mir besser liegen werden und manche nicht wir werden sehen was im kommenden rennen passiert
694223 du scheinst einen ziemlich guten start gehabt zu haben aber kamst ziemlich weit auf die rechte seite wurdest von kubica weg gedr ckt kannst du beschreiben was dort passierte und war es auf dieser seite sehr schmutzig
694224 ja der erste teil war sehr gut aber ich entschied mich auf die innenseite zu gehen und er dr ckte mich etwas auf die innenseite und ich verlor einen platz es war schlussendlich also kein sehr guter start ungl cklicherweise blieb ich hinter alonso h ngen aber so ist das leben
694225 wo gehst du in ferien hin und welchen sport wirst du dir bei den olympischen spielen anschauen

694271 whoever the zimbabwean negotiators agree on we will be happy to sit down with we can only boycott the forthcoming sadc summit if we feel the democratic process of setting up a new zimbabwean government was questionable
694272 to us as the botswana government it does not matter who the two negotiating parties agree on as the head of a new zimbabwean government
694273 if they agree on mugabe or tsvangarai before the august 16 sadc summit we will receive that leader with both hands
694274 some people think we hate mugabe as a person no to us it is not the candidature that matters but the political process

694277 the suspect produced a knife and also threatened to kill the two girls he the ordered one them to life face down the other was told to lie on her back and allegedly raped her
694278 truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense
694279 the presidency has noted todays sunday front page article of the sunday times headlined mbeki took r30 million and gave some to anc president jacob zuma
694280 the report which purports to be a result of a six months investigation is but a hotch potch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
694281 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain ie president thabo mbeki received a bribe of r30 million from man ferrostaal
694282 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
694283 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
694284 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
694285 there are therefore no grounds to suggest that the governments contracting position is flawed
694286 by the way the mystique attached to this information starts to ring hollow given that information about these competitors is easily available on the internet
694287 in other words what is meant to be a six months investigation by the sunday times turns out to be peddling of information among competing companies including in its own words a number of arms dealers who were involved in bidding for the south african contracts
694288 its grotesque allegation that zuma acted as mbekis front man during the arms deal negotiations particularly in the context of the court process currently under way
694289 whereas the article acknowledges that it is based on allegations the papers editorial the arms deal truth must out once and for all openly attaches truth to the allegations
694290 the unstated premise of the editorial is that the allegations are truthful because the sunday times says so
694291 by readily regurgitating known and spurious allegations supposedly after six months of a laborious investigation while at the same time concealing easy to find information which casts doubt on the credibility of its article the paper appears to be pursuing an agenda that it only can explain
694292 the danger exists that journalism which plays an important role in any democracy may ultimately become a rumour industry in which any and every allegation finds its way in the pages of newspapers thus stripping the profession of the legitimacy that it must enjoy in pursuit of its role
694293 if the president facilitated a r2 million bribe for jacob zuma and r28 million for the anc it would show that the anc is rotten to the core
694294 president mbeki must now explain himself to the nation in a televised address without delay we have the right to hear his side of the story
694295 whether he admits or denies the allegation the president must appoint a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a judge of impeccable reputation and with full powers of subpoena to fully investigate every aspect of the arms deal
694296 but we are not surprised can we trust the anc leadership both mbeki and zuma mbeki and the anc have been asked many times to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry
694297 it explains why the newly elected lynch mob that controls the anc is reluctant to trust the judiciary because they are aware of these shady dealings and schemes
694298 the dollar goes much further for both the student and the taxpayer
694299 given todays economic pressures and the need to retrain workforces business leaders are discovering community colleges as a solution to the skills gap
694300 our small classes of 11 to 12 students the emphasis on teaching and our lower costs make us an attractive alternative to a large university
694301 i am proud that our students who transfer to four year universities have higher gpas than the students who started at that university
694302 i wanted to buff up my gpa have my core requirements completed in smaller classes save money and develop the study skills to succeed at a large university
694303 my experience has definitely given me a leg up with a better chance to transfer to the university of maryland
694304 if you are looking for a large university with student activities and sports then community colleges are not your choice

694318 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
694319 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
694320 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
694321 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
694322 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
694323 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
694324 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
694325 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
694326 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
694327 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
694328 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
694329 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
694330 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
694331 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
694332 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
694333 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
694334 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
694335 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews

694337 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways

694354 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
694355 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward
694356 because of those two things the market has turned into an emotional rollercoaster
694357 we think that in june there will be a last gasp boost to income from the remainder of the stimulus cheques
694358 as a result personal income and spending are likely to be subdued

694362 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
694363 i think i drove well i didnt make any mistakes its just that i had a puncture
694364 i brought the car home as safe as possible scored as many points as i could so theres not much more you can ask for
694365 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again
694366 i had it three times last year or whatever and thats what lost me the championship
694367 it can be very very costly but the fact kimi didnt win heikki did and timo glock was second means im quite happy because they have taken points off everyone else
694368 above all its been a great day for heikki i know what it feels like to get your first grand prix win its a very special day for him
694369 i had one of my best ever starts but felipe had an even better one
694370 i covered my ground on the inside he locked up and then turned so i thought we were going to touch so i slowed down even more

694372 ferrari were strong although if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different

694374 when i was then told about what happened to massa i didnt think much of it other than it was an extra place for me which is good
694375 why do we buy all the new stuff that doesnt even make us any happier

694431 we are very happy with the weekend we knew beforehand that a one off entry into wtcc would not be easy partly because we would race on a completely new tyre for us and partly because we would have a total of 42 45 kilos of extra weight as a debutant with ethanol in the tank but this only spurred us even more
694432 we came here to evaluate and learn the job was completed as planned and gave us a taste for more to jump in to wtcc and be in the top ten straight off with a completely new car is good the crash itself has to be considered as a compliment if a top ranked factory driver has to crash in to you to get past then you know you are doing a good job

694454 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
694455 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either

694457 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
694458 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
694459 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet

694464 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe
694465 seven years after anthrax laced letters terrorized an already frightened nation a new suspect suddenly emerged in the public eye this week but he was gone just as quickly committing suicide before he could be charged with murder and adding another dramatic twist to the bizarre episode the governments working theory that brilliant but troubled army scientist bruce e ivins released the anthrax to test his cure for the toxin answers some of the questions perhaps but many details remain unclear i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure said former senate democratic leader tom daschle of south dakota whose office received a letter containing the deadly white powder in 2001 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today ivins unexpected emergence as the top and perhaps only suspect in the anthrax attacks follows on the heels of the governments exoneration of another army scientist in the case last month the justice department cleared ivins colleague steven hatfill who had been wrongly suspected in the case and paid him 5 8 million
694466 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
694467 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity

694470 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
694471 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
694472 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
694473 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
694474 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
694475 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
694476 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the army let the injured enter
694477 in my opinion hamas will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity that will be difficult to resolve
694478 there are plans to evacuate all children whose parents give their consent

694480 the door is open they just need to step through it by suspending their enrichment of uranium
694481 i am not mediating and i dont carry any message from any western country
694482 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
694483 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
694484 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
694485 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
694486 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
694487 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
694488 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
694489 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine

694494 it comes down to a simple choice for all of us if you like the direction the country is going you should vote for mccain but if you want a candidate who rejects those policies but has a vision then obamas your guy
694495 the end of the south how obama vs mccain is unsettling the old confederacy
694496 the south i saw was troubled by changes that go well beyond this change election a generation is growing up with traumas more immediate than those of the 1860s or the 1960s jobs are disappearing to places that are truly foreign not mock strange states like california new immigrants are introducing brown into a color map that has long been dominated by black and white there is a sense that a world is ending maybe not this year but inevitably
694497 youthful insouciance that for many years has helped mccain charm reporters like me is now channeled into an ad that one gop strategist labeled juvenile another termed childish and mccains own mother called stupid the obama campaigns new mantra is that mccain is an honorable man running a dishonorable campaign lame is more like it

694503 we enjoyed the moment but now weve got to move on the important thing for us is that we back this up on friday against southland
694504 we got behind on the scoreboard against canterbury but the boys showed some composure to get in front and then hang on
694505 but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then weve got a big show
694506 whenever you win and you win well you always take confidence tactically we got it right but we cant get too carried away because a week ago wed been thumped australia will come back
694507 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
694508 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
694509 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
694510 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
694511 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past
694512 those roads have always been our lifeline but we were cut off
694513 opening the floodgates has damaged the stopbanks which will come at a cost to the ratepayers

694522 youre always as good as the guy next to you so when the guy next to you starts playing good it makes you better you start picking some things up on why that guy is playing good or whats going good for him you learn from each other
694523 i didnt know how many innings i feel like as long as i throw the ball good thats all i can really ask hopefully the rest takes care of itself
694524 things just werent going my way plus i dug a hole by walking the leadoff guy
694525 thats never going to be good i didnt make too many mistakes last night
694526 gary came in and had a perfect double play ball
694527 it just kicked up on brandon you couldnt ask for anything more thats the guy you want it hit to if you had a choice it was just some bad luck
694528 that wasnt the first time i screwed up a game and it wont be the last time i screw up
694529 its a whole new game that was a different situation different setting you go out there you make your pitches and see if it works out
694530 what do we have fifty one games left this season
694531 if we give the ball to gregg say 35 times were winning this division
694532 i love the fact that when the eighth inning ended 10 seconds later there was a phone call and it was youre in
694533 as a closer its a tough situation because yeah you want ricky to finish the game but you dont want to be coming into a mess that you didnt create he would rather start his own inning its a lot easier for him
694534 felt good swinging the bat running i dont know i was happy with how it went
694535 i just felt good i know that i was happy when i finished up the rehab assignment i figured id know and id have a good feeling about when in my head i have nothing but positive reviews for myself i was real happy about how it went
694536 really dont have an answer havent talked to them yet
694537 he looks healthy its a great look hes got going on im still waiting to discuss this with him and andrew friedman rays executive vice president of baseball operations theres nothing physical he has to do today to insure us that hes fine i just need to talk to him specifically about how he feels hear it from his mouth
694538 i wasnt playing every day which is something i have to do now i dont think its really realistic for me to be out there every day but im ok with that im happy with whatever role i have if and when i get back with the team
694539 i was used sparingly for the entire rehab assignment i mean i could do it here and it was pretty hot in montgomery that didnt help the situation i was able to get through it it was a good experience
694540 i dont think the doctors have complete knowledge of it because i think everybodys case is different so i think you just stick with the treatments they give you and see where it goes theres no real way to know what its going to mean five or 10 years from now its something i try not to dwell on
694541 its somehting ive waited for the entire time ive been here with this organization
694542 its not something i was going to just let pass me by without a fight
694543 when a guy needs a day off you have to give it to him
694544 vlads played a lot i dont know how many days he has played in a row but its a lot itll be good for him to get off his feet for a day
694545 with torii out obviously your preference isnt to take two big bats out of your lineup for a day but we dont want to stretch it with vlad
694546 hitting ninth hopefully hell connect with tex in the third spot and feed the middle of our lineup
694547 with the day off he can recharge a bit then get out there tomorrow
694548 hes gotten treatment on the knee for four years thats routine everythings fine its no different than any player whos got 100 games under his belt
694549 its a good sign our lineup can stay this deep we feel good about some groupings we have today
694550 the last year of yankee stadium and im able to get some photos of myself with reggie jackson
694551 tims been wanting me to meet him but i havent had the guts to walk up to him so when i saw him there with tim by the batting cage before friday nights game i walked over and introduced myself to him i told him i was named after him how my dad was a big fan of his
694552 he was real cool down to earth it was great posing for a few pictures with him thats something ill always have
694553 i dont think ill hit it quite like he did
694554 but ill definitely try my best im glad im in there today and get a chance to play in this stadium before they move over to the new park theres a lot of history here
694555 sometimes you have to weigh the benefits you dont necessarily want to leave him out of the lineup ever but if it gets him back to being productive like he was before its worth it
694556 robbie obviously is an outstanding player but wilson did a nice job yesterday
694557 by having him wait all the way to tomorrow night hell feel really good
694558 obrigado aang maso senhor do foco esta em outro castelo

694624 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
694625 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
694626 a disappointing race unfortunately we just werent fast enough and it was a circuit that didnt play to our strengths our nearest rivals both had respectable scores today but well be pushing hard to recover lost ground in the remaining races
694627 were disappointed not to score any points this weekend well continue working hard to find more performance in our package and will fight hard to come back soon
694628 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
694629 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
694630 todays result is a solid and encouraging one for the whole team our two drivers did a great job and we are now ready to continue pushing hard in the second half of the season to finish in fourth place in the constructors championship
694631 its a great result for the team and probably our best race of the year both cars had to race hard and we had to think our way carefully through to the end of the race the results and points achieved today are a good reward for lots of hard work in the team and at the factories
694632 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
694633 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
694634 we were completely off the pace during the race neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds the reason for that is currently not clear but we shall analyse everything congratulations to timo glock for his strong weekend crowned by finishing second
694635 of course we are very disappointed with todays performance now we need to analyse why we were not able to match our qualifying performance during the race we shall do this in the factories in hinwil and munich because due to the testing break we are not able to test before the next race in valencia in three weeks
694636 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
694637 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
694638 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish
694639 lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
694640 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
694641 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
694642 being a track like budapest its extremely difficult to overtake especially when everyone gets stacked up behind one another
694643 difficult race but well look forward to the next one during the break before the next couple of grands prix even though were in a balancing act of developing the 2009 car with improving this years car well still be working hard on the fw30 in order to make progress in the remaining races
694644 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here
694645 i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
694646 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me
694647 after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
694648 todays race was never going to be easy from our grid positions from the first lap both drivers were held up by heidfeld who was running on a different strategy and this prevented them from using their true pace the new developments that we brought to hungary have definitely helped us to improve the performance of the car as is always the case though the rest of the field isnt standing still and we do not yet have the pace to score points on our own merit
694649 far from it its true that the break will give the race team members some well earned respite from what is a fairly gruelling schedule however the staff at our bases in brackley bracknell and tochigi will all be pushing on to help us improve our competitiveness for valencia
694650 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying
694651 it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
694652 i didnt have a very good pit stop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon i made a mistake in running wide at the last corner on the first lap and lost a lot of places i was stuck behind barrichello and it was impossible to overtake this hasnt been a good weekend and that goes back to friday when i suffered reliability problems and then came the disappointment this afternoon
694653 there can be no excuses this was a bad weekend for the whole team
694654 then at his first pit stop on lap 32 we had a problem with the fuel system which caught fire fortunately it was extinguished in time but the problem reoccurred at his second stop on this occasion he had to make a further stop to have the extinguisher foam removed from his visor as he could not see we must now carry out a full investigation of all the problems on both cars after what was a very disappointing weekend for the whole team
694655 i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
694656 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship
694657 i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
694658 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season
694659 jarno was quick as well and pushed hard but he was blocked for most of the race he couldnt show his pace until briefly in the last stint so this is a stunning performance and my thanks go out to the whole team and everyone working in the factory im very appreciative of all their hard work and next we will aim for the centre of the podium
694660 my start was normal i was on the outside going into turn one but then i had to go a little bit wide and dropped back a place
694661 considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
694662 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1min 22 6 which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
694663 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances
694664 adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend
694665 i think we can be pleased with the teams performance this weekend on a track where qualifying often determines the finishing position giancarlo was able to improve three positions on his starting position through a combination of a bold strategy and his own very polished overtaking maneouvres
694666 adrian also looked to be racing competitively despite the problems that started very early on for him while its disappointing to not get two cars to the finish again we raced very well and finished in front of cars yet again were looking forward to the european grand prix now where i hope the introduction of the seamless shift gearbox will move us ever closer to the midfield
694667 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever
694668 i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
694669 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way
694670 its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
694671 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
694672 kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
694673 it hurts to see a car stop with a failure just a few laps from the end when you are solidly in the lead
694674 today we showed our package is up to the job in terms of performance but we lacked the necessary reliability we must continue to work to improve still further as indeed our competitors are doing we can expect some weeks of hard work ahead of the next race where we want to achieve what slipped from our grasp today in the very last moments

694682 we dont have any choice we have to reduce the gap between us and the hamas movement
694683 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
694684 hamas raided our family burnt our houses and terrified our children thats why we ran from gaza
694685 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
694686 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
694687 gue suka banget musik jazz mungkin karena umur juga jadinya
694688 hahaha gini di umur tertentu elo gak bisa lagi dengerin musik yang berat berat hidup kita sendiri sudah cukup berat tiap hari harus mikirin bayar ini gimana bayar itu gimana masa mau dijejeli musik yang nge jeng jeng jeng jeng gitu tambah pusing kan karena itu gue suka jazz karena jazz itu liar jazz itu menyenangkan ada klasiknya ada bluesnya dia gak seluruhnya modern tapi juga gak seluruhnya tua permainannya lebih luas gitu
694689 tadinya gue sering mikir jazz ini hanya untuk kalangan tertentu saja tapi di sisi lain kalau gue mikir kaya gitu kog kayaknya kita seperti meng underestimate orang lain siapa tahu orang lain yang tadinya memang gak tahu musik jazz juga bisa meng apriciate dengan bagus yang pasti kalau yang nonton mk surabaya nanti memang suka entertainment dan keindahan mereka pasti akan suka musik musiknya

694708 with the exception of a tiny minority of muslims who would like shariah law adopted in england immigrants arent trying to change england into another version of their birthplace
694709 why should people throw off their cultural identity just because they are in a new place
694710 i hate the way that in some places its unusual to see a non white face
694711 in fact if we hadnt had the influx of immigrants following the world war ii this country would have gone completely under
694712 it would be awful if immigrants renounced their language and heritage as a price for living somewhere with free healthcare and opportunities for work people should have a right to live wherever in the world they want to without having to live up to certain specifications we dont own this land it isnt ours to distribute to those we approve of and fence off from those we dont
694713 the unskilled uneducated generally take minimum wage jobs that our native english people are too proud to do
694714 england hasnt lost its culture because of foreigners diluting it we have lost it because we arent interested in it
694715 i brought up teenage mothers and mcdonalds employees in a specific context as you will see if you reread it saying that i might expect uninformed bigoted opinions from them
694716 i dont have the time energy to find you statistics essays books that demonstrate the extent to which immigrants helped the uk stay afloat
694717 im of the opinion that everyone is entitled to medicine and care whether or not they have money
694718 how is someone wearing a sari or speaking polish to other poles effecting you
694719 immigrants arent coming here and demanding managerial positions while an english born person goes without a job immigrants tend to come in right at the bottom rung earning terrible money they arent cheating anyone out of a job
694720 i suggest you go away and head to a library so that you can realise how unbearably stupid your right wing attitudes are
694721 a huge cathedral has someone rebuilt the blue mosque next to st pauls without me realising has anyone proposed that
694722 you go on a rant about all middle class people
694723 you know what i would like to see british people having to make way for others
694724 in my experience and probably that of many others immigrants work harder than native brits
694725 islam is not an evangelical religion in nature unlike christianity which is pretty much the most vile religion that ever existed
694726 hurray for england and its selfishness greed intolerance and stupidity i feel so proud

694728 nationally in 2006 07 police reported 5 619 hate crimes in which someone was injured 4 350 hate crimes without injury and 28 485 cases of racially or religiously motivated harassment there were also 3 565 cases of criminal damage related to hate crimes the typical hate offender is a young white male most homophobic offenders are aged 16 20 and most race hate offenders under 30
694729 they put the fanaticism right back into the word fan
694730 theyre so dedicated i mean theyre loyal and they get so excited you wouldnt think its about books that always surprises me you know thats how i felt about books as a kid
694731 but it was a really nice childhood my parents were good parents
694732 so did you ever think during that time that there was a writer buried in there somewhere
694733 no i never dreamed of being a writer and i know that just sounds horrible because so many people do and they dont get this opportunity but that to me was such a i mean how vulnerable is that to do that and try for that because you know youre gonna fail you know everybody tries for that
694734 i had this completely amazing dream that was just you know about first love
694735 when i woke up i was so mad you know because it was right in the middle i wanted it to continue and i didnt wanna call up somebody and be like oh let me tell you about this dream everybody
694736 so i wrote it down i had made my dream into a real existence and i was hooked on writing from that day
694737 i was writing this story i dont really know how i thought of it myself it was just this thing i was doing
694738 so while im making breakfast for the kids and my husband was getting them off i was thinking about you know whats going to happen and what are they going to say now it was coming so fast the problem was not being able to type fast enough
694739 and when every time the kids needed something i was pretty bad
694740 i sent out i think 15 queries total i got nine rejections five no responses and one assistant who pretended to be acting on behalf of an agent who asked to see it october i got my agent and november i had a deal with little brown my publisher that was not quite six months
694741 one day im just staying up writing a story for fun and the next day i have a career
694742 in my head you know j k rowling and some of the other authors that ive always loved are in this other place you know so this put me up there with the real authors and that was you know a lot
694743 i like to sort of see what people are saying and how theyre saying it i wanna know peoples reactions sometimes thats not always a good thing you know there are reactions im not expecting but i just like to know what people are thinking
694744 before i ever thought of twilight as a book or something i would publish i was casting it in my head
694745 does it ever make you anxious at all thinking oh my gosh im all the way up here
694746 and you know when youre on top its always a long way down
694747 i think you have to be afraid of the fall
694748 so if everything goes away tomorrow and no one ever picks up another one of my books and no other movies are made and i just stay in my house im gonna be ok with that so im not afraid of anything
694749 i got on a bus going the same route whats the difference

694752 the storm that hit auckland on saturday wasnt that severe in waitakere
694753 sure we had some trees fall down and some slips but it wasnt the major cause of power outages those were due to the infrastructure
694754 why should anyone have to wait three days to have their power restored
694755 look at some of the power poles around the city they were put up last century
694756 we are asking them to come to the next council meeting and explain to the council and the people of waitakere city why they have failed to deliver a service its unacceptable
694757 during the storm more than 90 000 customers were without power
694758 vector is extremely appreciative of the patience and support shown by customers in these areas while field crews worked 24 7 to get the power back on
694759 at times it was unsafe for the crews to work above ground but they continued to monitor the network and assess the damage
694760 during storms it is vectors priority to restore power to as many customers as possible as quickly as possible by repairing the backbone of the network first
694761 to get to our camp we had to go through hiroshima

694769 we have people ringing up and saying we have to go to the finance company before we can pay for this job
694770 ive got people who want to take petrol out of cars after theyve been written off

694788 i always recorded sounds since my pa gave me a cassette recorder when i was about 15 i think with derek jarman i liked to record the sounds from the filming because often we had no official sound recordist and he used to think the italian way and record mute anyway from caravaggio 1986 on i was always on location with him if possible derek had a habit of super 8 mm filming whenever he could because it was cheap fun and easy ish to organise
694789 james mckay the producer had organised a weekend shoot down at prospect cottage
694790 mrs oyler lived next door to prospect cottage and derek suggested we went to see her and her daughter sylvia because she was the oldest resident of the beach community and dereks neighbour so we trundled about 15 yards across the shingle next door now mrs oyler was rather deaf but not stupid and she was filled with extraordinary stories about living on the shingle as a young woman during the second world war after moving there with her husband as a newlywed couple shed previously been in service in london tea and cakes please yes we only went to see her twice i think we felt a little guilty because im not sure why we were asking her to tell her stories for us social history dereks own thirst for knowledge who knows but i knew that id use some of her voice in one of dereks films one day or other and so we did i think perhaps in the garden a few years later she was a sweety bless her im sure the oylers still live there now but ill have to check with keith
694791 this was recorded for the soundtrack of the film the last of england we used parts of the recording in the film but this is the unedited version the gentleman in the recording is selling stolen cheap jewelry i first started to record the sunday morning market when derek asked me to get extras for caravaggio the wall at the beginning of the market was best i got the two beautifull old ladies from italy there they were my finest east end find but one morning i heard this amazing ranting and what a guy i couldnt figure out how to record him without being seen always a problem when theft is involved a few weeks later i went to see if he was still around oh yeah there he was not far from the doc martin shoe shop easy i did the normal microphone up the arm job pretending to listen i never monitor recording out in the street no earphones or such just straight top level no overload setting and recorded straight onto a sony walkman pro with condenser mic
694792 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
694793 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
694794 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less
694795 you could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this the s amp p 500 was down around 1 200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1 250 or so i think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market
694796 overall the us banks reported weak but not disastrous second quarter results and the markets breathed a sigh of relief
694797 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

694801 ive heard that there is support growing for including coaches in consideration for the hall of fame in the future
694802 obviously im not going to be too objective about this but theres no question that two names immediately come to mind when you talk about great coaches of the last 25 years in terms of batting coaches you have charlie lau and in terms of pitching coaches you have dunc
694803 whenever over the years ive been asked where i might manage next i always answer that if you find out where dave duncan is coaching thats where ill be managing
694804 to me hes the complete pitching coach it doesnt matter if its a left hander or right hander young or old starter or reliever quiet guy or loud guy mechanics or preparation how to attack a hitter or how pitch to the defense the bottom line is that he does it all that he always has something that can help a pitcher improve
694805 working with dunc gives you confidence in what youre doing because you always know that hes worked out the best plan for you you never have to wonder about his advice because you know its always right on
694806 if you do the things dunc outlines for you you know you have the best chance for succeeding
694807 its a total thing its not just stuff with your delivery or going over scouting reports or pitch sequences its everything dunc prepares you to be at your best
694808 hes hit everything pitches at every location whether its because hes from here and he gets fired up to play us i dont know but hes been very very good against us

694816 if i were in canada i would be hopping mad about the lack of ability to crack down on these corrupt people who are involved in this trade and on the farmers who are growing the opium
694817 they are clearly financing the people who are attacking your troops attacking the british troops in helmand province and attacking the americans throughout as well
694818 his power base is in helmand and kandahar provinces thats where 70 to 80 per cent of the opium is grown and he does not want to crack down on the people there because he needs their support for reelection
694819 look we cannot support your government anymore if youre protecting narco traffickers
694820 you karzai need to hit the trade at all levels
694821 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with the problem
694822 i know that canada is prepared to set up and be part of the solution does it necessarily mean going out and burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
694823 it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build democracy in afghanistan

694852 you had a kebab in the middle of basra thats marvellous news brilliant
694853 and this was one of them as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually they had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
694854 it came back on track very quickly and it became abundantly clear that maliki had judged the mood in basra exactly right that people were fed up with jam actually i was rather proud how quickly our chaps reacted
694855 but the jobs just kept getting more and more interesting
694856 you have to look at iraq as a continuum and it has got us where we are which is good there have been all sorts of steps along the way its like the today programme endlessly asking about the disbanding of the iraqi army i mean how far back do you want to go
694857 hes less a battlefield general than the sort of guy who can put together a team more an eisenhower than a montgomery maybe he is a big man there are no ego problems with him he just lets people get on with what they are good at
694858 the people have seen what its like and they hate it
694859 people want ordinary politics not religious politics even in hiyyaniya which is a very poor area where people desperate for cash would be hired by the hour to fire rockets they bitterly resent what they were made to go through by jam what i think you will see is some pretty violent extremists and notice im not using the term jam ie those people who were trying to dominate i think you will see the extremists trying to launch attacks against the iraqi government and the coalition
694860 iran has the same interests as the iraqis do in a peaceful democratic iraq
694861 its going to be a rich country whether you like it or not unless we all find alternative fuel sources
694862 i think the security gains here are going to sustain because theyre going to bring in the investment for the oil to be exploited economically iraq cannot fail to be a key player in the middle east and the iraqis are an able lot held down until recently by a pretty brutal regime
694863 the people need a stake they need to have aspirations we want to get a political process that will enfranchise them
694864 it isnt doing missions so much that puts people off staying in the army

694866 change needs to be psychologically ingrained so they dont even notice us leaving
694867 i am confident my advice will be heard this has to be an iraqi decision it is now a bilateral relationship and that is a huge measure of progress the british ministers do listen they have to really
694868 you had a kebab in the middle of basra thats marvellous news brilliant
694869 and this was one of them as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually they had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
694870 it came back on track very quickly and it became abundantly clear that maliki had judged the mood in basra exactly right that people were fed up with jam actually i was rather proud how quickly our chaps reacted
694871 but the jobs just kept getting more and more interesting
694872 you have to look at iraq as a continuum and it has got us where we are which is good there have been all sorts of steps along the way its like the today programme endlessly asking about the disbanding of the iraqi army i mean how far back do you want to go
694873 hes less a battlefield general than the sort of guy who can put together a team more an eisenhower than a montgomery maybe he is a big man there are no ego problems with him he just lets people get on with what they are good at
694874 the people have seen what its like and they hate it
694875 people want ordinary politics not religious politics even in hiyyaniya which is a very poor area where people desperate for cash would be hired by the hour to fire rockets they bitterly resent what they were made to go through by jam what i think you will see is some pretty violent extremists and notice im not using the term jam ie those people who were trying to dominate i think you will see the extremists trying to launch attacks against the iraqi government and the coalition
694876 iran has the same interests as the iraqis do in a peaceful democratic iraq
694877 its going to be a rich country whether you like it or not unless we all find alternative fuel sources
694878 i think the security gains here are going to sustain because theyre going to bring in the investment for the oil to be exploited economically iraq cannot fail to be a key player in the middle east and the iraqis are an able lot held down until recently by a pretty brutal regime
694879 the people need a stake they need to have aspirations we want to get a political process that will enfranchise them
694880 it isnt doing missions so much that puts people off staying in the army
694881 people actually enjoy and value this what takes people out is the pay the condition of the housing all the things they have to do in the middle the boys arent well paid but doing something like this is what you join the army for
694882 change needs to be psychologically ingrained so they dont even notice us leaving

694948 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
694949 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
694950 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed about what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
694951 it hurts to see a car stop with a failure just a few laps from the end when you are solidly in the lead its a real shame because felipe drove an extraordinary race a perfect start always a fast pace and a great management of the situation in the final stages kimi was behind alonso for two thirds of the race and only when he had a free track ahead of him was he able to show what he can do today we showed our package is up to the job in terms of performance but we lacked the necessary reliability we must continue to work to improve still further as indeed our competitors are doing we can expect some weeks of hard work ahead of the next race where we want to achieve what slipped from our grasp today in the very last moments
694952 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
694953 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
694954 we were completely off the pace during the race neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds the reason for that is currently not clear but we shall analyse everything congratulations to heikki kovalainen for his maiden win in f1 and of course timo glock for his strong weekend crowned by finishing second
694955 of course we are very disappointed with todays performance now we need to analyse why we were not able to match our qualifying performance during the race we shall do this in the factories in hinwil and munich because due to the testing break we are not able to test before the next race in valencia in three weeks
694956 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
694957 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
694958 its a great result for the team and probably our best race of the year both cars had to race hard and we had to think our way carefully through to the end of the race the results and points achieved today are a good reward for lots of hard work in the team and at the factories
694959 todays result is a solid and encouraging one for the whole team our two drivers did a great job and we are now ready to continue pushing hard in the second half of the season to finish in fourth place in the constructors championship
694960 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
694961 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
694962 being a track like budapest its extremely difficult to overtake especially when everyone gets stacked up behind one another we didnt have a good first lap with both cars losing positions we also had a problem with the fuel rig on nicos car which dropped him behind kazuki whose strategy we had changed difficult race but well look forward to the next one during the break before the next couple of grands prix even though were in a balancing act of developing the 2009 car with improving this years car well still be working hard on the fw30 in order to make progress in the remaining races
694963 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
694964 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
694965 a disappointing race unfortunately we just werent fast enough and it was a circuit that didnt play to our strengths our nearest rivals both had respectable scores today but well be pushing hard to recover lost ground in the remaining races
694966 were disappointed not to score any points this weekend well continue working hard to find more performance in our package and will fight hard to come back soon
694967 what an incredible feeling i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
694968 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship im glad for timo because he has had a very good weekend and fully deserves this result this could have been better for me too despite my problems in qualifying i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
694969 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season we had a few difficulties in practice but during qualifying the drivers pushed themselves to the limit and things got better and better today timo did a fantastic race we saw immediately that his car was quick and and his third stint was almost perfect he was under threat from kimi but he was quick in the third sector and he was able to fend him off jarno was quick as well and pushed hard but he was blocked for most of the race he couldnt show his pace until briefly in the last stint so this is a stunning performance and my thanks go out to the whole team and everyone working in the factory im very appreciative of all their hard work and next we will aim for the centre of the podium
694970 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying the race also started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
694971 i didnt have a very good pit stop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon i made a mistake in running wide at the last corner on the first lap and lost a lot of places i was stuck behind barrichello and it was impossible to overtake this hasnt been a good weekend and that goes back to friday when i suffered reliability problems and then came the disappointment this afternoon
694972 there can be no excuses this was a bad weekend for the whole team it seems that budapest is not vettels place as we had technical problems on friday and this continued in the race as he had to retire at this time we are not exactly sure what the failure was but we suspect it was due to overheating as for bourdais he made a good start moving up from 19th on the grid to 16th then at his first pit stop on lap 32 we had a problem with the fuel system which caught fire fortunately it was extinguished in time but the problem reoccurred at his second stop on this occasion he had to make a further stop to have the extinguisher foam removed from his visor as he could not see we must now carry out a full investigation of all the problems on both cars after what was a very disappointing weekend for the whole team
694973 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
694974 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
694975 todays race was never going to be easy from our grid positions from the first lap both drivers were held up by heidfeld who was running on a different strategy and this prevented them from using their true pace the new developments that we brought to hungary have definitely helped us to improve the performance of the car as is always the case though the rest of the field isnt standing still and we do not yet have the pace to score points on our own merit the break will give the race team members some well earned respite from what is a fairly gruelling schedule however the staff at our bases in brackley bracknell and tochigi will all be pushing on to help us improve our competitiveness for valencia
694976 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1min 22 6 which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
694977 my start was normal i was on the outside going into turn one but then i had to go a little bit wide and dropped back a place then the problems started on the third lap when my brakes started to overheat particularly the rear ones and i had to move my brake balance forward from that point on i had problems with lots of locking on the front and understeer and it was difficult to handle the car considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
694978 i think we can be pleased with the teams performance this weekend on a track where qualifying often determines the finishing position giancarlo was able to improve three positions on his starting position through a combination of a bold strategy and his own very polished overtaking manoeuvres adrian also looked to be racing competitively despite the problems that started very early on for him while its disappointing to not get two cars to the finish again we raced very well and finished in front of cars yet again were looking forward to the european grand prix now where i hope the introduction of the seamless shift gearbox will move us ever closer to the midfield
694979 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances giancarlo lost a position at the start but both drove good first stints we put them on slightly different strategies with a short middle stint for adrian and a longer one for giancarlo we were able to jump some people in the pit stops with giancarlo and although he just wasnt able to hold it in the final pit stop at least we were able to race with the group in front adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend
694980 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
694981 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
694982 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish hackneyed it may be but its true nonetheless even so you have to feel sorry for felipe who did a very good job but heikki drove superbly scoring his first grand prix victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
694983 im sorry for felipe and ferrari lewis had bad luck with the tyre felipe with the engine heikkis first win is sensational and he deserves it we are obviously successful with our finns first mika then kimi and now heikki without the damaged tyre lewis also had a chance of victory until then his race went according to plan and his strategy with a later second stop could have put him ahead of felipe congratulations to timo and toyota on their second place today timo kept the world champion behind him the podium showed again that the fight for the world championship will remain very exciting during the so called summer break we will continue to work hard to be well prepared for the next race on valencias street circuit which will be new for everybody

695048 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
695049 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
695050 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
695051 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
695052 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
695053 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
695054 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
695055 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
695056 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
695057 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
695058 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
695059 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
695060 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
695061 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
695062 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
695063 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
695064 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
695065 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
695066 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
695067 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
695068 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
695069 gas prices are not coming down in the near future

695078 shes at that point where she can call me and say hey dad whats up
695079 its hard for me to be the tough guy with my daughter
695080 maybe i should work on the discipline stuff but i could leave her mother to do that
695081 so last night we just wanted it to be quiet and you know have a nice quiet evening together
695082 we sneaked in and got to sit in the audience and see other people be nervous
695083 she does these workshops around the country with teen girls and gets them to really open up about self esteem and body issues

695090 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
695091 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
695092 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
695093 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
695094 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
695095 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
695096 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
695097 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
695098 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
695099 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
695100 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
695101 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
695102 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy

695108 que constata que incapaz de cultivar a terra e que tem vergonha de mendigar
695109 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
695110 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
695111 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
695112 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
695113 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
695114 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
695115 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
695116 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
695117 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
695118 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
695119 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
695120 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd

695128 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
695129 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand

695134 the resistance is now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake
695135 if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war
695136 we are stronger than before and when hizbullah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war
695137 close to adopting practical measures that will force israel to cease the overflights
695138 we wont make a big fuss over the delayed response to our nuke offer what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the coming days
695139 deeply embarrassing for those who claim there is no extremism in british universities
695140 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
695141 they believe the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
695142 the jews gt should have offered themselves to the butchers knife

695146 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
695147 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
695148 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
695149 because thats the only neighborhood the cops will let them burn down
695150 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
695151 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
695152 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
695153 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
695154 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
695155 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
695156 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
695157 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
695158 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
695159 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
695160 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
695161 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
695162 if the vice president says its do able i believe
695163 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
695164 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
695165 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
695166 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
695167 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
695168 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
695169 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
695170 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
695171 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
695172 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
695173 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
695174 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
695175 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
695176 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
695177 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
695178 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
695179 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
695180 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
695181 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
695182 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
695183 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
695184 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
695185 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
695186 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
695187 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
695188 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
695189 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
695190 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
695191 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
695192 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
695193 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
695194 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
695195 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
695196 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
695197 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
695198 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
695199 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
695200 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
695201 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
695202 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
695203 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
695204 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
695205 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
695206 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
695207 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
695208 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
695209 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
695210 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
695211 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

695214 the largest field operation in the history of american politics
695215 the climate has made millions of americans who havent been involved in a political campaign ever in their lifetimes very active
695216 we estimate that 70 percent of our grass roots volunteers havent worked in a campaign before were somewhere just shy of 2 million volunteers and we think we can potentially triple that on election day
695217 we think the turnout will be beyond record turnout and if were effective we will have done two additional things brought in millions of new people who are registered to vote and we will increase the percentage of registered voters who will turn out
695218 this allows us to increase the volume of voters were talking to and have it be done with people who live in their community
695219 people tend to believe information delivered by people they know and who live in their neighborhood more than an ad they see on television or what some third party from out of their state is telling them

695225 for those of us who despair about christianity and judaism having gone astray the notion that islam might be the spark that generates a new religious revival based on mutual respect and spiritual intensity could dramatically expand our understanding of the endless potential for god to surprise us
695226 islam is a moderate culture and we are determined to prevent extremists from hijacking islam

695230 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
695231 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
695232 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
695233 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
695234 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
695235 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
695236 you gotta be out of your freaking mind who would want to buy a perishable item because it looks like something

695238 call me crazy but im getting tired of having to pay 10 percent of our federal budget just to service the national debt
695239 it will instead complement the three tier security in place for a peaceful conduct of the polls
695240 and for that the government did not have to re enforce the emergency rules with notification

695243 i am not a pessimist i cant sit around thinking about what other people could not achieve i dont believe in that we will do our best tac has been created with a mission of realizing a vision
695244 corruption has hit our country on such a large scale that it will be time consuming if you want to catch all of them trials will continue without an end and at one point a half of the capital will have to be turned into jails

695250 this is the first time i have come across such a limited number of animals and birds in these forests this is unbelievable
695251 most animals have lost their hiding places cover from which they could hunt preys nesting and resting places
695252 the process of clear felling has also resulted in large scale removal of the so called indigenous minor species of plants and animals which supported the growth of larger showy animals such as tigers leopard rhinos buffalos spotted deer hoolock gibbon peacocks and pheasants hornbills burmese brown and other tortoises pythons and king cobras etc
695253 thus the present day forest as we see as far as our eyes go do not i repeat do not represent the evergreen or mixed evergreen forest we had about two centuries back when the british first started commercial forestry or consumption of natural forest for their own benefit and replaced the same with the commercially important species
695254 bangladesh embassy in kuwait is keeping continuous contact with kuwaits labour department to ensure minimum wages of workers and their rejoining work
695255 it is said that kuwait is a friendly nation to bangladesh bangladesh during the iraqi war in kuwait fought with kuwaiti soldiers but kuwait today is torturing and deporting bangladeshis this is not acceptable
695256 actually in the name of sending workers agencies are trading visas and laundering money
695257 if needed it should declare that it would bring back the workers from kuwait if that country cannot respect our people
695258 to avoid such incidents in future the government should set the minimum wage ensure good working conditions health and other facilities by signing bilateral agreements with the countries concerned
695259 we do not support the act of taking the law into ones hand but we guess there might have been many incidents of hardship and exploitation that forced the workers to demonstrate
695260 we are observing with deep concern that the ministry of foreign affairs and bangladeshi embassy in kuwait are not taking proper pro active measures to tackle the situation
695261 we cannot be a part to legalise the unconstitutional government by participating in the stage managed elections
695262 the election commission did not take any action against those who violated electoral rules encouraging corrupt incompetent and dishonest aspirants to go ahead
695263 we made a few mistakes in the past but i can assure that those mistakes would not be repeated in future

695267 how can i go on without her now why didnt allah take my life instead of hers
695268 shilas scarf was blown away by a strong wind and the scarf got tangled in the high voltage electric lines that runs by the roof of the house

695276 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
695277 stressed that across the board in pakistan all political parties want improved relations
695278 the two sides agreed to coordinate their efforts to stop cross border terrorism
695279 to prepare grounds for a framework for close and constructive engagement between the two countries to build confidence and develop a common strategy at the political military and intelligence levels
695280 weve arrested people for the slightest violations so theyve slowed down gradually
695281 weve created a list of suspicious individuals but at least 95 percent are unlikely to create a lot of trouble so were only monitoring them
695282 a lot of people were confined in a small area
695283 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
695284 the chance to perform at the cricket game in front of lots of famous faces is absolutely termendous i couldnt believe it i was fortunate to recieve some money from the princes trust to break in to the music business it is an amazing charity that does so much to give young people a chance in life

695287 i would have wanted to see serious progress by the chinese government before i make a commitment to attend the opening ceremonies in the absence of some sense of progress in the absence of some sense from the dalai lama that there was progress i would not have gone
695288 we were not aggressive in encouraging the chinese government to make serious concessions in its talks with the dalai lama
695289 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
695290 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
695291 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
695292 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
695293 du bist mein homie du da mit der baseballm tze du bist mein homie du hast ne kamera schick monta den film und wenn du das machst dann werden wir du auf meinen schultern durch dein heimatdorf reiten und ich werde deinen namen schreien
695294 anfangs war ich eigentlich nur perplex dass er mich direkt angesprochen hat nachdem ich meine kamera gez ckt hatte
695295 so etwas ist mir in diesen 15 jahren noch nie passiert
695296 jetzt ist neapel wieder eine abendl ndische stadt in der kein m ll mehr herumliegt
695297 den rest kann ihnen dann ja der herr weidmann erl utern
695298 meine aufgabe ist es allein die themen so aufzubereiten dass sie eine entscheidungsgrundlage hat
695299 ich lege das f r und wider dar und mache deutlich welche argumente aus meiner sicht schwerer wiegen
695300 ein heller kopf kann die kompromissfindung und kontaktpflege eher lernen als ein politischer taktierer das klare denken
695301 nat rlich hat man es in einem akademischen institut oder im sachverst ndigenrat leichter die reine lehre zu vertreten
695302 f r einen politischen berater aber reicht das nicht er muss nach pragmatischen politisch durchsetzbaren l sungen suchen
695303 meine erfahrung ist dass nicht alle schritte im beruflichen leben planbar sind und auch zuf lle und gl cksf lle eine nicht unerhebliche rolle spielen
695304 es geht doch nicht darum dass ich da mal irgendwo einen kommentar geschrieben habe
695305 parteisch digenden aufrufe zur nichtwahl der spd in zukunft zu unterlassen
695306 dann h tte ich zur ckgefeuert und den oder die zur rede gestellt und mich auseinandergesetzt
695307 die angemessene und demokratischste m glichkeit zu einer sachlichen er rterung zu kommen
695308 niemand in der spd das recht dazu aufzurufen die spd nicht zu w hlen
695309 ich glaube wir sollten dabei bleiben dass die landesverb nde das selbst entscheiden
695310 ich rede dem herrn gabriel und der frau kraft auch nicht rein
695311 der letzte versuch m sste allen beteiligten klargemacht haben auf solche abenteuer sollte man sich nicht einlassen
695312 nicht erkennen dass sich die situation seit dem letzten versuch grundlegend ge ndert hat
695313 para que se practique un desalojo es necesario una orden judicial instrumento legal con el cual no cont para realizar dicho desalojo
695314 acciones de este tipo manifiestan una irracionalidad por parte de las autoridades municipales al avasallar impunemente a una dependencia perteneciente al estado bonaerense como el registro civil ente que cumple una funci n tan b sica e indispensable como administrar el otorgamiento de los dni partidas de nacimientos denuncias matrimonios entre otras tr mites
695315 bregamos para que esta situaci n sin sentido pueda arribar a un acuerdo positivo entre la provincia y municipio en beneficio de los vecinos y los empleados de la delegaci n

695317 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
695318 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
695319 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
695320 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
695321 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
695322 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
695323 if solich pulls out a winning record ill give him my vote for mac coach of the year

695325 it was hell how could they not tell civilians from north korean troops
695326 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
695327 the u s military hardly took into consideration a risk that its massive bombing and incineration operations could take heavy tolls on civilians
695328 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
695329 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go
695330 and then the fire incinerated everything and spread into the cave
695331 his bowels spilled out his mother fell down and cried over his body in the shower of bullets
695332 for years when it rained water flooding out of the cave carried the bones away
695333 our goal from the very start is to get people using these resources so they appreciate them and are interested in conserving them
695334 in some conditions it would be for experienced paddlers only
695335 i had one customer who wanted 14 cords of tree length wood
695336 peak buying is normally in march and april and this year the panic started in june
695337 this is a different dynamic and sellers werent ready they have a sort of rhythm and this year it just got blown out of the water
695338 theres no question this is going to be a hard winter for people because of the demand
695339 its not even a question of how much it costs for wood pellets or firewood so much as if theyre even available
695340 it was more just for the beauty of it and the atmosphere
695341 but this year im going to be much more diligent
695342 i think people who wait until september or october are going to have an unpleasant surprise
695343 if you had a primary source of heat and you were burning one cord of wood a winter it certainly would be advisable for a person like that to spend a little time and up that to two cords
695344 that i think is defensible from an economic standpoint and also an environmental standpoint
695345 more rooms its a fully finished attic but i use it for storage nowadays
695346 oh more storage it used to be a servants apartment back in the old days but it hasnt been lived in for quite some time decades i suppose

695348 nonsense im only asking that you cover the utilities and help keep the place up which means helping with the housekeeping its a big house but with the four us i believe we should be able to manage quite nicely
695349 now there are a couple of other items which youll have to agree to

695351 two this is my house which means youll live by my rules you must tell me in advance if youre going to have a guest and no boys upstairs you can visit with them in one of the sitting rooms on the first floor
695352 three no loud music no loud conversations in the living room ive been living on my own for some time now and im used to my peace and quiet and four no hard liquor an occasional glass of wine in the evening or with dinner is fine but liquor is the devils tool i hope you can abide by these simple rules
695353 excellent ill leave it up to you to pick out your rooms
695354 maybe aunt cecie is just lonely or it could be
695355 shes one of those psycho grannies who take in borders only to chop them to bits after poisoning them

695372 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand
695373 on suggestion i do have to offer is to give some kind of training to new teachers and substitutes as well on what kind of real life situations one can expect and practical ways to deal with them i know this would have been extremely helpful for me especially that first week

695399 id like to ask you not to require your collegues to be perceptive
695400 lets beat them down with guns and batons and trample them under our feet we must be ready to drown the whole country in blood if only there is the slightest chance of preserving white supremacy
695401 there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountain tops of our desires
695402 dangers and difficulties have not deterred us in the past they will not frighten us now but we must be prepared for them like men in business who do not waste energy in vain talk and idle action the way of preparation for action lies in our rooting out all impurity and indiscipline from our organisation and making it the bright and shining instrument that will cleave its way to freedom
695403 change date time month year i forgot the exact name for it change the time to the future for something interesting set it to the past log on any account and it should be super old

695405 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
695406 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
695407 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
695408 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
695409 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
695410 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
695411 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
695412 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
695413 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
695414 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
695415 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
695416 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
695417 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
695418 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
695419 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
695420 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
695421 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
695422 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
695423 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
695424 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
695425 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
695426 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
695427 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
695428 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
695429 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
695430 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
695431 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
695432 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
695433 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
695434 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
695435 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
695436 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
695437 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
695438 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
695439 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
695440 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
695441 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
695442 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
695443 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
695444 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
695445 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
695446 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
695447 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
695448 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
695449 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
695450 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
695451 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
695452 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
695453 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
695454 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
695455 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
695456 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
695457 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
695458 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
695459 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
695460 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
695461 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
695462 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
695463 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
695464 m s mother came to pick her up then the other two stuck even closer even going to the bathroom
695465 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
695466 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
695467 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
695468 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
695469 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
695470 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
695471 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
695472 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
695473 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
695474 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
695475 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
695476 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
695477 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote

695489 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
695490 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
695491 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
695492 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
695493 while dealing with a stranger common courtesy you use but the family you love you seem to abuse go and look on the kitchen floor youll find some flowers there by the door those are the flowers he brought for you he picked them himself pink yellow and blue he stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes

695496 son i love you too and i do like the flowers especially the blue

695498 if lesbians are simply women with a particular sexual identity who look and act like all women then the major difference in living out a lesbian sexual identity as opposed to a heterosexual identity is that as lesbians we live in a homophobic world that threatens and imposes damaging loss on us for being who we are for choosing to live whole lives homophobic people often assert that homosexuals that is we dont have to act out our sexual identity in that case i want to hear heterosexuals talk about their willingness not to act out their sexual identity including not just sexual activity but heterosexual social interconnections and heterosexual privilege

695542 this isnt a book in which the author has thrown in a grab bag of his experiences together and presented them with splashy graphics instead kalbach breaks out concepts often presenting conflicting points of view he mentions alan coopers call to dispense with navigation entirely and embellishes it with research from the fields of usability and human factors this approach makes the book feel academic but it doesnt take away from the readability of the text at all congratulations to oreilly and the books design team
695543 this handsome volume will help web designers learn how to analyze their business needs and translate them into a workable navigation system for their users unlike some other design books james kalbach doesnt shove his own design principals down the readers throat instead he cites use cases and usability studies that will help readers figure out which design approach will best suit their needs

695662 last sunday jim david adkisson 58 walked into the sanctuary of the tennessee valley unitarian universalist church carrying a sawed off shotgun concealed in a violin case
695663 unitarian universalism is the most unabashedly liberal denomination in america
695664 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied the countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of the major media outlets
695665 could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement he would then target those that voted them in office
695666 here in the united states unitarians believe that we actually invented american democracy
695667 thomas jefferson considered himself a unitarian and john adams and john quincy adams were two other early unitarian presidents
695668 and unitarian universalists have always been prominent in all of the social movements in this country we were prominent in the abolitionist movement and unitarian leaders both men and women were very prominent in the struggle for womens empowerment womens right to vote and so it has continued on to the present day we support the struggle of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons so we have been a part of the american democratic tradition since there was one

695676 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances
695677 giancarlo lost a position at the start but both drove good first stints
695678 we put them on slightly different strategies with a short middle stint for adrian and a longer one for giancarlo
695679 we were able to jump some people in the pit stops with giancarlo and although he just wasnt able to hold it in the final pit stop at least we were able to race with the group in front
695680 adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure
695681 while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend
695682 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot
695683 we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me
695684 in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace
695685 even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1m22 6s which is a good lap time
695686 that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
695687 i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions
695688 then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind giancarlo fisichella
695689 we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that
695690 after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace
695691 i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop
695692 that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
695693 being a track like budapest its extremely difficult to overtake especially when everyone gets stacked up behind one another
695694 we didnt have a good first lap with both cars losing positions
695695 we also had a problem with the fuel rig on nicos car which dropped him behind kazuki whose strategy we had changed
695696 difficult race but well look forward to the next one
695697 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here
695698 however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
695699 i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners
695700 i got boxed in at turn one and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside
695701 i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld
695702 he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy
695703 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me
695704 we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint
695705 then at my first pit stop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig
695706 after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress
695707 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
695708 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
695709 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
695710 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
695711 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
695712 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
695713 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
695714 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
695715 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
695716 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
695717 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time

695732 you have to be very careful because youre invading their space
695733 it has to have entertainment value and its less commercial in that venue than we would be in our newspaper inserts which are aggressively promotional
695734 he was a hairy bear he was a scary bear

695749 its the hardest decision i ever had to make but also the easiest
695750 i expect important progress to be achieved by the end of this year and a solution by the beginning of 2009
695751 however we at this stage have agreed on our positions details will be discussed during the negotiations process
695752 some say the decision can be perceived as the allusive recognition of the trnc by fifa and the union of european football associations uefa
695753 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
695754 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
695755 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal

695793 were at war our economy is in turmoil and weve got so many challenges that the people of this country deserve a serious discourse and it shouldnt be limited necessarily to three kind of very regimented debates in the fall

695800 thanks to a steeply progressive federal income tax states with higher incomes pay vastly higher federal taxes payments that are unlikely ever to be matched by federal spending directed to those states ironically most of these high paying states are the so called blue states that have generally elected politicians who support a more steeply progressive tax system even though their own constituents bear a greater share of the burden as the code gets more progressive
695801 police and intelligence agencies rather than the military should be the tip of the spear against al qaida in most of the world and the united states should abandon the use of the phrase war on terrorism
695802 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end

695809 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
695810 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
695811 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
695812 we may not have put an end to all our problems
695813 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
695814 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
695815 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
695816 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
695817 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
695818 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
695819 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
695820 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
695821 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
695822 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
695823 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
695824 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
695825 i believe he is much better now than he was then
695826 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
695827 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
695828 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
695829 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
695830 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
695831 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
695832 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others

695835 one of the most important books i have read in recent years
695836 video killed the spirit and showmanship that movies was all about and turned the mob mentality of a theatrical screened movie into a solitary consumer experience that plays into the arrested development
695837 for the past three and a half years it has been my privilege to represent chivas usa and its passionate fanbase as my very first professional club chivas usa will always have a special place in my heart

695839 she is smart sexy funny and knows the stripper business from all sides heather will be the color commentator for the competition and i dont think there was a better choice on all of planet earth
695840 besides vegas is my home strippers are my sisters and these guys produce hot shows labor day weekend my favorite place what could be better
695841 this sounded like such a great gig the moment i heard about it no way i was turning this down
695842 hell would have to freeze over for us to sell dean to a major rival it would be no surprise to us if there are certain clubs who would be interested in him but we worked very hard to put together a deal to keep dean at the club and he remains a massive part of our ambitious plans
695843 i am saddened that the house leadership has chosen the washington style path of partisanship by rejecting a good and capable man the secretary of the commonwealth has no i repeat no role in the enforcement of virginias right to work law a law i strongly support
695844 once the blonde starts doing her little apocalyptic roller derby jig around 1 30 things are really just getting started
695845 well that old crook is out of the white house finally thank god
695846 if youre in the penalty area and dont know what to do with the ball put it in the net and well discuss the options later
695847 id kick my own brother if necessary its what being a professional footballer is all about
695848 of course i didnt take my wife to see rochdale as an anniversary present it was her birthday would i have got married in the football season anyway it was rochdale reserves
695849 if you are first you are first if you are second you are nothing
695850 just go out and drop a few hand grenades all over the place son
695851 at a football club theres a holy trinity the players the manager and the supporters directors dont come into it they are only there to sign the cheques
695852 if a player is not interfering with play or seeking to gain an advantage then he should be
695853 take that bandage off and what do you mean about your knee its liverpools knee
695854 remember grobbelaar and the rubbery legs of 84 and do the same dance do anything put them off
695855 we were sitting in the dressing room and we could clearly hear thousands of fans singing youll never walk alone can you imagine how that felt we were 3 0 down in the champions league final and all we could hear were 45 000 people letting us know they still believed in us
695856 the problem with you son is that all your brains are in your head
695857 i was the best manager in britain because i was never devious or cheated anyone id break my wifes legs if i played against her but i d never cheat her
695858 football is a simple game based on the giving and taking of passes of controlling the ball and of making yourself available to receive a pass it is terribly simple
695859 in my time at anfield we always said we had the best two teams on merseyside liverpool and liverpool reserves
695860 for a player to be good enough to play for liverpool he must be prepared to run through a brick wall for me then come out fighting on the other side
695861 a football team is like a piano you need eight men to carry it and three who can play the damn thing
695862 when you need someone to stand up and be counted to pull an absolute rabbit from a hat steven gerrard has done just that we know the name son
695863 some people believe football is a matter of life and death i am very disappointed with that attitude i can assure you it is much much more important than that
695864 how could i leave after a night like that it was the greatest night of my life
695865 si parla solo e sempre di questo argomento e mai della squadra e dei campioni che ci sono ora ha dichiarato van nistelrooy a skysports ormai tutti ci aspettiamo una nuova chiacchiera senza che ci sia poi mai nulla di concreto leggendo attentamente le dichiarazioni dello united non credo proprio che abbiano intenzione di lasciar partire ronaldo
695866 i can only say that inclusion is a reality in our diocese and will continue to be for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
695867 that would be ultimate dream to play for nine inch nails
695868 just the way he pieces the music together is just amazing the guitars the drums its just amazing this is my first time seeing em i cant wait
695869 i always say it i love this club and today you can see i have a big smile on my face yes im at arsenal im very happy at this club
695870 when i was holidaying a lot of people were talking on my behalf which is not me i have never said i will leave the club
695871 so now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract im feeling very good here and my heart is with arsenal
695872 this club gave me a chance to be who i am today so i have to thank them and i think the boss understands that as well
695873 now we have to work hard together as a family and deliver better than we did last season
695874 my relationship with arsene wenger is always strong when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving and he knew my desire my desire was to stay so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it
695875 im very happy that weve found a solution to stay here i thank all the fans all the people who support me to make my dreams come true
695876 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me
695877 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league but at the moment the most important thing is to get through because we have a qualifying game in the champions league
695878 we have to just keep our heads on our shoulders and keep playing our football we have a great manager great squad good players
695879 its true were young but we know if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something thats for sure
695880 i know some english players did criticise me after the game with birmingham trying to make of me responsible for this defeat 2 2 draw and i thought they exaggerated
695881 the only thing i can say is that we could have won there and when you want to be champion you have to keep in mind that those games make the difference
695882 i said i will change the way i speak to the players because they are one year older and are more conscious of what they have to do
695883 then i hope this season will be the good one

695886 i dont know the reply of the army there is no reply i dont know what the excuse they will come up there is no excuse whatever the child was doing throwing stones or whatever there is no excuse and there is no right to kill a nine years old child or seventeen years old child when they are in a protest the question is like the question is why these children they are in the protest because theyre aware of whats happening and whats going on in their village theyre protesting against stealing their lands killing their brothers shooting at their houses invading their village
695887 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
695888 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

695900 corporate raider and oilman t boone pickens has been buying up water rights in the texas panhandle in the belief that water is going to become scarce and salable this follows the logic that climate change shrinking lakes and rivers and population growth will make increasing portions of the world susceptible to water shortages
695901 water is a resource yet in some respects it is a commodity its as essential to human life as air that puts water in a different class
695902 each and every year a few go out of state

695913 you know if theres one thing that would make my virtual life complete its a rideable bear and it would be even better if the bear wore some cool steampunk goggles and to make it perfect if it had a cute juvenile fishbaby to ride it with me that would be over the top
695914 well the point of this ad is energy policy is a serious deficiency in this country vis a vis an energy policy weve been waiting 20 or 30 years to get one john mccain has suggested that we have an all above approach lets talk nuclear lets talk drilling lets talk biofuels lets talk biofuels in a way thats smart and doesnt disrupt the agricultural community but lets get it all on the table and senator obama said no nuclear no drilling
695915 he seems open to drilling right now as part of a comprehensive package
695916 well now he said that in the morning and later on in the afternoon he clarified his position he said i am opposed to drilling he is opposed to drilling
695917 but he said he would accept it as a part of a comprehensive package
695918 that he clarified later in the day i mean its typical you know every once in a while we see him playing basketball and hes obviously a pretty good athlete and probably has a pretty good head fake so the head fake is well ill deal with a compromise but later on depending on the audience too hes saying i dont favor drilling and he doesnt favor nuclear so at the end of the day you say to yourself this is a competitive issue short term and long term at the end of the day i think members of both parties are moving closer and closer to senator mccains position by saying look we need to put it all on the table lets figure it out we need both a short and long term energy policy and by the way the windfall profits tax that senator obama feels is pretty popular politically popular doesnt reduce the price at the pump doesnt reduce our dependency on foreign oil and doesnt increase produ ction so that ad was about energy and lets get serious lets recognize who he is very charismatic gives great speeches but its substance time ninety days left to go lets talk issues

696024 i came from a country where i was able to exercise and run outdoors every day
696025 i moved to canada where the winter makes it very tough to maintain that sort of outdoor exercise routine i tried persisting for a year or two but then i realized that i had to get myself into an exercise and training program in order to be able to train indoors without necessarily going out to a gym i knew that i was not alone in this need and thats how i got started on the idea of selling home fitness equipment
696026 i will be providing information about exercise and health both physical and mental
696027 i want to help people find the balance in their lives for exercise working toward motivation and the benefits received ill be discussing exercise programs that work for particular groups as well as helping people find their motivation to maintain that program the equipment will be discussed at length helping people discover which items are best for use in different applications so that they dont spend money on something they will not use
696028 i feel that exercise is very important for your health and wellness because theres a direct balance between physical fitness and mental health and wellness
696029 as a person becomes older its even more important to stick to a healthy self care program i am into the middle age group and because of that ive realized how important it is to stay healthy and fit maintaining all of the benefits that come from good fitness if you stay healthy the way you experience life in general is more healthy

696095 one of my goals when i joined the tour was to win an event and i wasnt sure if it was going to happen since ill be stepping away after this season
696096 but the waves pumped this event this is what the dream tour should be like all the time im definitely stepping away from the asp tour at the end of this year but im not retiring im still planning on competing at pipeline and teahupoo and at venues that i can get into
696097 i was tripping out in the water when they kept announcing fred patacchia and i in the final you never hear that
696098 it was all business though this is only the second time ive ever made one on tour and i wasnt about to let it go i was trying my hardest out there
696099 my brother has won this event twice and all i could think about in the final is how i wanted that trophy
696100 the thing is sick it was a great event and were going to have a huge party tonight
696101 bruce irons and i are good friends but we were super competitive in that final
696102 both of us wanted to win and we were hassling and trash talking and everything i had one wave at the start but bruce got two bombs towards the end and i could tell he was really gunning for it
696103 it feels great to come back after a slow start to the year
696104 the waves were so good for this event and im bummed i didnt win but to have bruce irons there and since hes stepping away it feels good that we kept the title within hawaii
696105 if i had come out of that one barrel then i would have been in the final but ive had a great day and a 3rd place finish really helps me this year the next event is in my backyard lower trestles and im pretty confident out there ill be spending a lot of time preparing for that event but first i am going to enjoy this magical island and all the beautiful waves it has to offer
696106 this is the best result of my career and it takes the pressure off of me to get a 3rd at the halfway point this season
696107 i dont know what it will do to the ratings but it should help me and give me a better seed going into lower trestles i have a pretty busy summer i am doing all the asp wqs events in europe so it is a lot of surfing for me coming up

696218 sabia que s iria perder por um problema e infelizmente foi o que houve quando quebrou eu n o acreditava no que estava acontecendo foi um momento frustrante um dos piores momentos momentos da minha carreira
696219 assim que me avisaram do pneu furado do hamilton eu reduzi o giro do motor pensando em salvar o m ximo do carro de uma volta para outra passei a ficar um segundo mais lento mas tendo consci ncia de que tinha 23 segundos na frente do kovalainen

696275 democratic presidential candidate barack obama will stop in indiana this wednesday at concord high school in elkhart setting hoosier political observers aflutter with renewed veepstakes speculation
696276 the event in elkhart would draw media coverage in nearby michigan a choice this week would come days before the beginning of the beijing olympics an event during which a vice presidential selection is thought to be unlikely the democratic national convention will begin august 25 the day after the close of august 8 24 olympic games
696277 portman for vp pluses minuses mccains looking for a buddy can he be it
696278 m any in the republican partys base of social conservatives think portman makes perfect sense a solidly anti abortion pro family republican teamed up with a presidential candidate who has sometimes bumped heads with party social conservatives
696279 the low road warrior mudslinging will damage mccains brand but it may be the only way he can win
696280 the strategy behind all this isnt hard to discern drive up obamas negatives and render him unacceptable to pivotal voting blocs thus the depiction of him as too young too feckless and too pampered to be president in almost every shot in the mccain ads obama is smiling flashily whereas mccain is pictured as weathered sober staring hard into the distance a clever bit of jujitsu using obamas pretty mug against him e ven if obama stays above the fray he might still pull this thing off because as unwilling as he is to get down and dirty mccain may simply be unable to drive a consistent negative message
696281 mccain has clearly figured that if he emerges victorious in an election that is obamas to lose he will have his entire presidency to repair whatever damage is done to his reputation he has also determined that his current strategy is his only chance of winning hes probably right on both counts
696282 i kind of enjoy em you gotta have a sense of humor in this you know a few days ago senator obama said he challenged me to a duel im for the light sabers as weapons of choice
696283 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues it is of a piece with the britney paris ad or the most recent website or the allegation that somewhat i wouldnt go visit the troops unless i had reporters were with me
696284 senator obama has designated congressman rahm emanuel as our representative to meet with the commission and the mccain campaign to review the specifics of the commissions proposal discuss any requested changes to that proposal and resolve any issues left open by the commissions framework

696288 hillary clintons dead enders some of whom mutter darkly that they will not only not vote for him they will never vote for a man again
696289 perhaps it is because feminists are still so busy cataloging past slights to hillary that they have failed to mount a vivid defense of michelle obama who has taken over from hillary as the one conservatives like to paint as a harridan
696290 clinton embraces return to ambassador role after the bitter primaries he calls charity my life
696291 with a negligible relationship with sen barack obama he has spoken to him just once since the primaries clinton has been shut out of the obama campaign almost entirely and does not know even basic things such as the role he will play at the democratic convention
696292 in his first extended interview since his wife exited the campaign in defeat clinton said he was glad to be back doing international foundation work
696293 clinton volunteered very little praise of obama beyond describing him as smart and a good politician when asked about him toward the end of the interview clinton appeared at ease in a yellow button down shirt and green khakis an unlighted cigar in his hand after a long day in which he had visited a remote town in eastern rwanda to meet with local farmers growing cassava a sturdy root plant with assistance from his foundation
696294 the end of the south how obama vs mccain is unsettling the old confederacy
696295 chris set off with irish photographer seamus murphy on a trail through the old confederacy that roughly traced shermans march to the sea what chris found was that this change election is unsettling dixie as well as throwing light on a much altered political and social landscape obamas candidacy at least in the short term may serve to reinforce old divisions of race and class but it is also revealing new storylines including generational divides and the assimilation of south asians and hispanics into southern life
696296 i found whites frustrated and indecisive about the campaign families at odds generations divided many who thought themselves beyond prejudice were surprised by their suspicions of the young black man from up north meanwhile many slave descended blacks hugely supportive of the half kenyan half kansan hawaii reared obama seemed afraid to hope too much never in the last century and a half has the south been home to so many people who were born and who continue to live outside its history
696297 just aint that different anymore the south tends to exemplify if sometimes in an exaggerated way much of what the nation thinks and feels
696298 w atch the map in the coming 90 days if history is any guide the south of 2008 or at least a part of it will determine the election not in defiance of the rest of the country but in concert with it
696299 too thin to win skinny obama see poll lead vanish as race gets personal

696306 barack obamas lost years the senators tenure as a state legislator reveals him to be an old fashioned big government race conscious liberal
696307 fundamentally he is a big government redistributionist who wants above all to aid the poor particularly the african american poor
696308 im amused to hear the mccain camps deep sense of grievance over any suggestion that mccain is running a xenophobic and often race tinged campaign against barack obama its amazing how you can be pushing a message that your opponent is in league with foreign terrorists and comparing him to twenty something white women best known for their behind the music episodes and so many people can get the wrong idea

696325 some of it is good you get little snippets that you might not otherwise get but they dont rise to the level of news
696326 message control how news is made on the presidential campaign trail
696327 on the other hand my concern is when that stuff becomes news whether you twitter it or put it on an im or whatever to some degree it still influences the mainstream media it starts to be what people pay attention to
696328 it steals peoples time of course and they could be spending that time reading some serious journalism but my guess is that i spend about as much time reading the interesting thoughtful pieces people twitter about as i do my twitter feed
696329 we cant come to any conclusions on what it is
696330 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
696331 whether its human or not we will have to wait and see
696332 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
696333 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
696334 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
696335 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
696336 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
696337 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
696338 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
696339 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
696340 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something graham said in an appearance on
696341 to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible
696342 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist daschle said in his appearance on
696343 hes never said anything that that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
696344 now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
696345 why wont you go to a town hall stand in front of normal people and answer their questions the whole thing is very disturbing why wont you allow the american people to look under the hood and test your tires on your ideas but you say your opponent has no ideas
696346 sen obama did something no one has ever done that i know of go overseas and have a rally in front of 200 000 adoring fans and talk like youre the embodiment of america that he is in fact living off celebrity not ideas and one of the campaign issues is credibility
696347 all i can tell you is that thank god that senator obama wasnt making policy on iraq he doesnt understand to this day tom that if you lose in iraq its a big loss in the greater war if youd lost in iraq the biggest winner would have been iran the topic were talking about
696348 but heres what john mccain understands dont elevate the tyrant he would never sit down with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad without preconditions because that is the worst thing you could do barack obamas judgment on iran has been terrible he would empower the very forces were trying to control by elevating them in the worlds eye so theres a huge difference here
696349 well obama has been consistent from the very beginning on this
696350 we have offered counter offered john had suggested some ideas for town hall meetings
696351 at this point at this point were really down to convention time and weve got two months so you cant there really isnt a lot of time for additional debates now
696352 est claro que ir n no le presta atenci n a las negociaciones
696353 but its chief ingredient is portland cement which is heated to 5 000 degrees during manufacturing and lets off high carbon emissions
696354 consumers are looking for easy answers and when i shop i prefer to see a logo on something and just buy it
696355 but the biggest piece of advice i have is dont buy a product because it has some green dot on it unless you understand exactly what that green dot means
696356 we have clients who buy a new house and want to remodel it and will throw away a perfectly good toilet and bathtub because its the wrong color if we cant change their mind we try to salvage it
696357 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy

696371 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
696372 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
696373 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
696374 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
696375 we currently have over 95 percent of all the vehicles running which is a tall order under these conditions
696376 in the old shop we had to rack and stack vehicles
696377 we worked on two vehicles in the shop and others outside in the hot sun it was like musical trucks the mechanics recently moved to a new indoor motor pool which allows them to service nine vehicles simultaneously we have more space so safety has improved the new shop is also air conditioned so the danger from heat injury is minimized
696378 we are always working on ball joints brakes and a c units there is a lot of work going on here
696379 by working shoulder to shoulder and being willing to help any unit in need weve earned some respect
696380 i want people to have confidence in the work we do
696381 there is nothing that you can give us that we cant fix
696382 my biggest fear is that someone will get hurt because i didnt do my job properly
696383 the mechanics of prt konar are just one of the many vital parts of the team
696384 they have gone astray and have followed the path of balaam who loved the wages of unrighteousness
696385 give me christ on any terms let god propound whatever articles he will i will subscribe to them would he have me deny myself would he have me mortify sin i am content to do anything just so that i may have christ
696386 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
696387 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it

696407 this study tells us that a rationally dosed growth hormone regimen does a pretty good job of improving several risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients who develop this syndrome while taking antiretroviral drugs but growth hormone therapy may be limited by its effects on glucose levels
696408 low dose growth hormone may be an effective and safe treatment for those whose glucose tolerance is normal and not for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
696409 in an earlier study our group showed that treatment with a drug that induces the release of growth hormone significantly decreases abdominal fat without increasing glucose levels more work needs to be done to determine which strategy is appropriate for particular patients as well as clarifying the role of lifestyle changes and eventually identifying new antiretroviral drugs that do not cause these metabolic abnormalities
696410 if you want to move the world move a congregation
696411 like any programme there are plenty that weve got hassles with but currently shes doing really really well im exceptionally proud of her
696412 if its what it takes to get her back engaged in school then thats great its really really good
696413 and then theres a knock on the door by the police who serve a letter
696414 theres an informal conference held at the school where some of the agencies get together along with the school and discuss what the issues are
696415 we dont want to prosecute parents for not having their kids at school but we also want them to buy in to the process to get their kids ultimately re engaged back in to school
696416 shes not a bad kid its just she hadnt been turning up to school
696417 sometimes the tough love approach is the best way because it is a shock to students when mum or dad is going to get prosecuted because theyre not going to school
696418 they havent just dumped her i knew he was doing that and its great

696422 thank you again i thought my iphone was dead thanks to this supposed unlocking service you saved the day
696423 just a quick note to say you are a lifesaver i still see the guys ad on cl who did the 1st unlock and when i call he hangs up go figure
696424 i cant believe you dropped what you were doing and came right to our office i couldnt even get some of those other ads on the phone we will strongly recommend you and feel free to use us as a reference
696425 it took this other dude on craigs list a whole day to tell me he could not do it you knocked it out in 15 minutes wow you really are the man
696426 there is no compelling evidence that this infection was contracted anywhere else
696427 i regret the failure of the original investigation to reach what now appears a reasonable conclusion and apologise for any distress this may have caused
696428 those roads have always been our lifeline but we were cut off
696429 opening the floodgates has damaged the stopbanks which will come at a cost to the ratepayers
696430 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
696431 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
696432 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
696433 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
696434 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past
696435 the oldest trick in the book with a new twist
696436 there is a risk to the employee that they will be found to have committed a dishonesty offence if they use fraudulent documents
696437 a lot of people have flooded lawns i know my one at home is pretty flooded
696438 the worst thing about this for us has been the road closure affecting the restaurant because cars cant get in
696439 sheep have been pulling the wool over our eyes for years
696440 they are like woolly dolphins affectionate and interested in things around them
696441 it has become really important and relevant to reduce the amount of money you spend on fuel
696442 it is relevant to plan how you can reduce your electricity bill having an insulated house thats cheaper to heat has become really relevant
696443 at the classes people share their experiences and share ideas and we have found that people do make substantial changes to their lifestyle after going
696444 its not something just academic they do this and they put it into action
696445 i cycle instead of taking the car i compost all my scraps and try to conserve water
696446 a lot of it is really good financially because we have got a young child and i am trying to survive on a limited income
696447 it sounded kind of like thunder in the distance shaking the windows but when i got up i saw it about a third of our lawn the whole patio area and the barbecue wed built was just gone
696448 but you cant get too depressed about these things no ones injured thats the most important thing
696449 i used to have it parked further up the road but thought it would get clipped by passing traffic
696450 if this had happened during the week my wife wouldve been putting our kids in the car
696451 i had to lift the lid to look inside and i just got walloped
696452 i could be dead its as simple as that if it was a little old lady i dont think they would have taken the shock
696453 she said she hadnt told me to touch it but how else could i find out
696454 then she said i accused her of trying to kill me and she hung up on me

696458 searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon
696459 the key thing for them to do is to rebalance the economy and move more toward consumption
696460 this is a very poisonous relationship in the long run for the world economy
696461 it has become a big player globally while it is still very low income per capita its the only country in history in that position
696462 which country is going to be the next economic superpower the candidate is china
696463 these guys have global aspirations and thousands of years of philosophical background saying theyre the best given the reforms china has successfully completed and the smart moves theyve been making to fund infrastructure they will overtake the u s economy in 30 years
696464 eighty percent of people live in the countryside many on less than 2 a day
696465 it will take a long time for them to get to the same level as people in the coastal areas
696466 take nike shoes they are designed in oregon manufactured in china from raw materials imported from malaysia and sold in american and german stores

696469 i heart the cookbook that my mom help put together for her church when i was a little girl its full of yummy recipes thanks
696470 we were playing all of our line so we gave everyone a run all four lines played pretty well
696471 but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then weve got a big show
696472 whenever you win and you win well you always take confidence tactically we got it right but we cant get too carried away because a week ago wed been thumped australia will come back
696473 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
696474 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
696475 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
696476 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
696477 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
696478 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
696479 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
696480 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
696481 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
696482 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
696483 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
696484 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
696485 it was a big day for new zealand rugby wasnt it
696486 there were a lot of people under a lot of pressure and they are pretty relieved
696487 weve been under a lot of pressure and we had to respond and the boys did so
696488 last saturday created the edge just sitting in the dressing shed after the game was like a morgue they just needed to think back on that
696489 it was just a matter of getting the tactics right to play the game well and the guys did that
696490 the game was a mirror of last week they didnt allow us to build pressure and as a consequence we were unable to get into the game it was one of those days when you try to create pressure and intensity and nothing works
696491 ive been under a bit of pressure you lose two in a row and it makes a huge difference to your life
696492 the way the guys played and the way they approached the game was very special
696493 i was probably showing a bit of emotion and a bit of relief as well
696494 it was a special day weve had a bit of a roll for the last four years but we are developing a new team and new zealand rugby is under a bit of pressure created by the world cup loss
696495 just in the right place at the right time i think
696496 i dont wont to know what the combination of metres made for my tries are but its not much
696497 we thought there was a chance to score from it and there was
696498 we enjoyed the moment but now weve got to move on the important thing for us is that we back this up on friday against southland
696499 we got behind on the scoreboard against canterbury but the boys showed some composure to get in front and then hang on
696500 it sure was a battle over the last 400m and it was tough with the boys surging a dozen times i was fortunate to be able to go with them and it was never in the bag till i crossed the finish line
696501 its great for the fans and melbourne are a quality side
696502 we approached the sydney match as just another tough game but i guess we knew if we won wed be in a final and that was motivating
696503 it was a big challenge for the young man hed only trained twice with us but i thought he did okay
696504 the research projects and studies conducted by our department generate an exorbitant amount of data from our mri scanners which require high performance and reliability we looked at several other vendors and they didnt compare to the high performance and utilization rates from pillar
696505 we were looking for a solution that combined density speed and ease of management pillar is one of the only companies that is able to accomplish that combination
696506 in using the axiom the human neuroimaging laboratory has already increased its usable disk capacity by 60 terabytes

696509 creo que hay una gran seriedad en el gobierno el gobierno quiere ganar la batalla y la nica manera de hacerlo es elevar la escala de las acciones y hacer visible el tema para todos

696514 we want everyone treated equally we have said rather than spend 60 000 on one paid position why not look at reimbursing all the volunteers for their on road time only
696515 given the support they gave for the new paid position at the july 16 meeting and their acceptance of st johns offer to pay them for lost earnings while on call outs
696516 this is probably the hardest thing i have ever done it was the head games battling two lots of two lines when there was only one
696517 i have got one hill to climb for my family members who havent been able to climb their own because they have passed on
696518 that frickin hurt jeez my back hurt but i wanted to keep walking and finish it for my family
696519 i pointed out many members had suffered considerable financial loss
696520 a lot of people in that age group have sacrificed a lot to save for their retirement only to find because of the negligence of directors ond managers of companies that have folded they have little chance of getting it back
696521 if these directors still have millions of dollars they should give it back if its been hard on mum and dad investors then it should be hard on them as well
696522 in 1982 we got our first bit of firefighting equipment which was a fuller trailer and that was based at blackmount station
696523 by this time we were having serious fire training a pager system was introduced we were on the call out emergency 111 system and one year ago we got our first response unit included in the blackmount fire team

696527 while it might seem like a practical joke or a harmless furtive glance e mail snooping could land you in more hot water than youd ever expect
696528 i dont think people are of the understanding that this type of conduct is a crime
696529 the deliberate withholding and or opening of us mail that is addressed to another party is a violation of federal law the penalty for tampering with us mail is a maximum of 5 years in a federal facility and or a 250 000 fine
696530 while it might seem like a practical joke or a harmless furtive glance e mail snooping could land you in more hot water than youd ever expect you could be charged with a federal crime
696531 said the dimly lit chamber is a vision of the future by the democrat party the lights are out theres no power and the air conditioning is gonna go off soon
696532 we so desperately need more help and the new numbers show it
696533 the poorest get hit the hardest our main goal in funding is medical care but there are a lot of ancillary services you need to make the medical care work out
696534 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
696535 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
696536 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
696537 were taking care of those folks and we have for years but those numbers dont count in determining the money
696538 part of our problem is to challenge the gay leaders in this state to challenge those who are already infected to use the best methods to not spread the virus
696539 to those in the black and latino communities continue to get tested
696540 if this celebrity framework is successfully imposed on obama the entire repertoire of obamania the mass rallies the soaring eloquence the picturesque cool of the candidate himself risks becoming a liability
696541 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
696542 when letterman is doing top ten lists about something it has officially entered the public consciousness
696543 and it usually stays there for a long long time
696544 there have been very few cases where weve had a situation as difficult as this
696545 lets do this now before it presents itself as an issue
696546 we so desperately need more help and the new numbers show it
696547 the poorest get hit the hardest our main goal in funding is medical care but there are a lot of ancillary services you need to make the medical care work out
696548 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while

696557 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
696558 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
696559 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
696560 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
696561 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
696562 dude a nice piece of real estate in exchange for sleeping with a guy youd sleep with anyway why are you thinking about this
696563 weve asked for two years in a row and the need has not gone away
696564 at some point we have to step up and say well support the schools
696565 when they decided to spend 40 000 that they didnt have so they could campaign by just calling 6 000 teachers and parents with no advertising and try to sneak it in i knew i had to get involved
696566 its a more honest approach in spite of what people are saying
696567 well know here in a week if it was successful
696568 i went to the hannah montana concert on wednsday november 14 2007

696685 fue un partido dif cil creo que nosotros mismos lo regalamos bamos bien y creo que no supimos manejarlo en el segundo tiempo en media cancha perdimos muchos balones y tambi n tuvimos una serie de desatenciones y ellos no las perdonaron
696686 tuve algunas oportunidades en ocasiones entrar n y otras no en lo personal me voy triste en este partido y con ganas de revancha para revertir esta situaci n
696687 hay muchos tipos de presiones lo nico que quiero hacer es las cosas bien en lo personal no me salieron esta noche pero ya saldr n con base en el trabajo
696688 cometidos muchos errores es para felicitar al rival que los aprovech pero tambi n lo tenemos que asumir que fueron errores nuestros que el partido no lo supimos liquidar cuando bamos dos a uno tuvimos dos opciones clar simas para convertir el tercero tuvimos accidentes en el segundo gol errores y lo pagamos muy caro cruz azul es un equipo letal lo sab amos teniendo estas oportunidades como las tuvimos no se puede perdonar en futbol no se puede perdonar m s all de las lesiones la expulsi n es decir nos pas todo en 15 minutos recorrimos todo pero fundamentalmente creo que a esas oportunidades de sacar dos goles de ventaja y pr cticamente cerrar el partido
696689 es el mismo portero que fue reconocido ante boca junior cuando entr de cambio el que jug el partido ante san luis tuvo accidentes y qu se le va a hacer ven a bien tambi n jug bien en la gira por eso le toc jugar lo que pasa es que en esa posici n un error se paga caro porque tambi n en la definici n de empujarla al tercer gol ah no pasa nada pero si es en el otro lado se paga muy caro
696690 pr cticamente s ha perdido a sus tres delanteros para el siguiente partido pero por eso digo que recorrimos todo en 15 minutos bogado ariel trat de probar a ver si pod a jugar en el segundo tiempo pero apenas pis el campo ya no pod a nos preocupa la lesi n de vargas gonzalo que ser evaluado con una resonancia el d a lunes esperemos que sea lo m s leve posible pero si no son los tres dos son seguros uno como vargas y el otro por suspensi n vamos a ver lo de bogado ya que es el tobillo y en esos casos es una lesi n m s accesible de recuperarse

696725 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
696726 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts

696927 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world
696928 even though its going to be very useful to have better more reliable figures its also disappointing and very sad that we found out that the epidemic has been worse than we thought for the last 17 years
696929 its like shifting from standard view to wide screen high definition television
696930 in fact the separate historical trends analyses suggested the number of new infections was never as low as 40 000
696931 the fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected in the united states every year therefore these findings should be a wake up call that the epidemic in the united states is far from over
696932 until you engage the department of justice on this issue as part of an overall comprehensive strategy youre going to miss a major source of infection for the african american community that then goes on to infect women and children
696933 the best programming books are timeless they transcend choice of language ide or platform they do not explain how but why if you feel compelled to clean house on your bookshelf every five years trust me on this youre buying the wrong programming books
696934 i just heard him keep saying my brother hes dead
696935 i just wish we could have been there 30 seconds earlier
696936 i kept thinking all day this is a horrible day to have kids down here
696937 oh well i guess i cant get this stuff today then
696938 make too much to qualify dont make enough to make ends meet
696939 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
696940 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
696941 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
696942 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
696943 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
696944 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
696945 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
696946 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
696947 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
696948 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
696949 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
696950 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
696951 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
696952 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
696953 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
696954 hi mama hi walid weeeee im doing great in here
696955 a holy man was walking through a desert as it was hot he was geting more and more thirsty until he raised his prayer to his god my lord if you want me to die here in this desert then i let it be so just after that he heard the cockcrow his heart jumped in happiness as he knew it meant there was a village very near he found inside himself the strength to run to this village but when he arrived to this village the people received him with rocks they threw to him he had no choice but to run and leave this village back into the desert and still thirsty he raised again his prayer to his god what is that my lord he asked when youre trusting in me answered the holy voice im here to protect you but when youre trusting in a cockcrow youre receiving only what you deserve
696956 this is a deserted place and it is already late dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
696957 there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves
696958 five loaves and two fish are all we have here
696959 because of the artistic aspect of it how like its like drawing a perfect circle you know what im sayin manually
696960 same goes for artistic integrity just the way it came together i really wish like ten million people could hear that mixtape know what im sayin and then just kinda reflect on it i feel like i did a real good job of just putting things together and conveying a message
696961 because im telling a story about crack city d c where crack really became popular over a classic hip hop beat
696962 thats a real sleeper the flow is just so conversational and it was like the first time of me really really stepping outside of my real flow and coming up with something different i aint really hear anyone else rap on that beat
696963 the 100 american is 99 idiot the trouble with her is that she lacks the power of conversation but not the power of speech
696964 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
696965 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
696966 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
696967 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
696968 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him

697010 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
697011 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
697012 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
697013 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
697014 im in a very strong position in terms of me so i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
697015 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
697016 hes very strong for sure this kind of race if youre able mentally to manage after the disappointment you have you will only get stronger
697017 and this is what were going to do together because that is the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
697018 when the track is clear we showed that we have the speed when there is traffic we cant take advantage
697019 it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result
697020 we had good speed in the race and without the mistake in qualifying it would be better
697021 national believes building better infrastructure is essential to fuelling higher levels of non inflationary economic growth for years to come
697022 new zealanders will have to assess the relative merits of what we are supporting and what we are not
697023 nikt nigdy przez tego pana ycia pozbawiony nie b dzie
697024 i think so i bring a range of different skills new zealanders know those its certainly a very heavy economic focus from my 18 years in the private sector
697025 i think at a time when new zealand is facing significant economic challenges those skills can be put to work
697026 its time to take the handbrake off its time to start the growth engine
697027 after nine years in opposition to devise its vision for new zealand it is a black farce that when the national party gets round to outlining its economic programme it amounts to nothing more than four words more borrowing from foreigners
697028 were borrowing for infrastructure were not borrowing for tax cuts
697029 if in theory were doing that then shes doing that its pretty straightforward and simple to understand we are not supporting some things the current government is and we are supporting a bigger tax cut programme

697035 the racial undertones of this assault are subtle but undeniable obamas calling out of the racial component of his opponents attacks though justified opened the door to the mccain countercharge that its he who is slapping down the race card a claim that however ludicrous puts obama in the position of denying in effect that hes a smoother calmer version of jesse jackson al sharpton and his former pastor wright

697037 we have a lot of dogs that are sleeping in beds riding in cars and living the good life
697038 our campaigns are always geared towards children and they always will be
697039 even if animal research resulted in a cure for aids we would be against it
697040 in 2003 peta euthanized over 85 percent of the animals it took in
697041 finding adoptive homes for just 14 percent by comparison the norfolk va spca found adoptive homes for 73 percent of its animals and virginia beach spca adopted out 66 percent
697042 peta has enough money in the bank to care for every unwanted animal in virginia where it has its headquarters and north carolina
697043 peta has provided euthanasia services to various counties in that state to prevent animals from being shot with a 22 behind a shed or gassed in windowless metal boxes both practices that were carried out until peta volunteered to provide painless death for the animals
697044 i would go to work early before anyone got there and i would just kill the animals myself because i couldnt stand to let them go through other workers abusing the animals i must have killed a thousand of them sometimes dozens every day
697045 we thought that peta just cared for animals more than they cared for humans but now it seems they dont care much for either

697073 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
697074 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
697075 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
697076 it was a combination of things financial and emotional my caregiving role all heaped themselves on me at the wrong time
697077 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
697078 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
697079 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
697080 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
697081 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees

697088 i saw an old women who lost two legs and a hand she was bleeding and later died before our eyes but we could do nothing as we ourselves needed help
697089 we do not have enough doctors and enough operational theatres it takes some time before all patients get access to emergency treatment
697090 they are lying in the corridors and some bled to death
697091 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
697092 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
697093 there is no theological defence for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
697094 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
697095 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
697096 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
697097 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
697098 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
697099 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything
697100 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind

697108 hey billy im going to burn this building down because it is named after you
697109 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
697110 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
697111 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
697112 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
697113 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
697114 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
697115 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
697116 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
697117 dieter der zweite platz ist doch etwas ganz besonderes zumal kimi r ikk nen auf p3 gelandet ist
697118 ja klar das ganze rennen war unglaublich schwierig wir mussten uns sowohl nach vorne als auch nach hinten orientieren um die beste strategie zu w hlen den zweiten stopp haben wir etwas vorgezogen aber das war wirklich ein unglaubliches rennen
697119 wir waren das ganze wochenende solide unterwegs insbesondere mit timo er war von anfang an schnell dabei und konstant was man auch schon gestern im qualifying gesehen hat und dann kommt nat rlich auch noch ein bisschen gl ck dazu
697120 habt ihr heute viel mehr per funk kommuniziert als sonst weil da vielleicht ein tick mehr nervosit t da war
697121 nein nervosit t war das nicht wir haben uns blo sorgen dar ber gemacht wo er nach seinem stopp wieder auf die strecke kommen w rde als felipe massa vor uns lag da hat timo pro runde 1 5 sekunden verloren
697122 zu diesem zeitpunkt war timo in einer phase wo er sehr schnell unterwegs war und so mussten wir abw gen ob wir mit einem fr hen stopp unter umst nden besser dastehen w rden also haben wir noch zwei runden abgewartet um das zu beobachten und haben dann den stopp tats chlich vorgezogen das lief aber alles im rahmen der blichen kommunikation
697123 hat der kampf gegen kimi r ikk nen auch an ihren nerven gezerrt
697124 ja klar kimi kam mit siebenmeilenstiefeln n her man hat hier deutlich den einfluss der reifen gesehen denn kimi war auf den option reifen sehr schnell auf prime eher weniger
697125 bei timo war das genau umgekehrt weshalb er gegen rennende mehr in schwierigkeiten steckte wir hatten aber einen sehr starken letzten sektor wo es vor allem darauf ankommt schnell aus der letzten kurve zu kommen das wiederum macht einen berholvorgang am ende der geraden recht schwierig das hat also gut gepasst
697126 war das jetzt so etwas wie der durchbruch f r timo glock
697127 haga hat im zweiten rennen sehr viel druck gemacht aber es war ein perfektes wochenende mit dem ersten sieg der trainingsbestzeit am freitag und dem startplatz in der ersten reihe
697128 okay from my list of speakers i want a session where the sessions key matches sessionkey now let me grab some fields i need first the key then the title which i need to trim off excess whitespace then lets make a short version of that title since steves title is so long love that title though ill need an link tag for the session set the href and title attributes and then add the speakers name in a div tag so i get a cheap line break im really in xml not html so ill need a root node and a span tag will work without affecting layout and ill add the link and div tags as children
697129 tive a oportunidade de estar com eles h um tempo atr s no afeganist o e da parte das autoridades militares os elogios nossa for a foram extremamente gratificantes

697140 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
697141 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
697142 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign

697152 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
697153 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
697154 first you help inject race into the campaign and raise its focus as an issue as the mccain campaign did yesterday with a little door opening from obama himself
697155 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
697156 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
697157 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
697158 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
697159 john mccain not serious silly ads silly attacks trivial like his choice of two female celebrities hes not to be taken seriously sings silly songs about bombing whines when criticized denies his own wrongdoing john mccain unserious in serious times
697160 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
697161 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
697162 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
697163 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

697185 mobile phones arent soulless devices theyre personal expressions and our lifeline to the people that matter to us as we navigate through all of lifes moments
697186 playing such a significant role in our lives mobile phones should reflect our individual style t mobile clearly understands this and were very excited about what the new sidekick will offer consumers
697187 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
697188 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
697189 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
697190 he has promised he would veto every bill that has them barack obama has voted for bills that are laden with pork whether its the 2005 bush cheney energy bill the 2008 agricultural subsidy bill both of those john mccain voted against because they were laden with pork both of those barack obama voted for
697191 john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes particularly because they impact small businesses and sole proprietorships more greatly than any other part of our economy
697192 his record is very clear on that and he has a number of economists who support his assertion that we can solve the social security and medicare crisis but particularly social security without raising payroll taxes
697193 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely to continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
697194 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
697195 i certainly agree with him that the situation could get worse
697196 and there are a couple of things that will make it worse one is to raise taxes which is what senator obama proposes to do another is to massively increase government spending which is what senator obama would propose to do over 1 5 trillion in increased government spending and the third is to become isolationist and protectionist which senator obama would also propose to do
697197 what senator obama said is that hell have a middle class tax cut and that tax cut will go to roughly 95 percent of all the people whose incomes are under 250 000
697198 for people whose incomes are in excess of 250 000 their income tax rates will go back to the rates we had under president clinton their capital gains rate will go up to some rate less than the rate we had during most of the time president clinton was in office taxes on dividends will go up to the rate that will apply to capital gains and that will be substantially below the rate that was in place when president clinton was elected
697199 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board
697200 on the other hand youre referring to the proposal that came up friday in which offshore drilling was a piece of a much larger piece of legislation
697201 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive
697202 and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy
697203 mad comic books had the term mad in the title for a reason they would overload the picture panels so that you had this feeling of uncontrollable chaos there had never been anything like that maybe hieronymous bosch
697204 college attendance is commonly associated with self improvement and upward mobility yet this research suggests that college may actually encourage rather than deter social deviance and risk taking
697205 knowledge of perceived barriers among employees can assist food and nutrition professionals in facilitating employees in overcoming these barriers and ultimately improve compliance with
697206 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
697207 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
697208 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
697209 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
697210 information on family history and the dietary and exercise habits in infancy
697211 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend
697212 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
697213 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
697214 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
697215 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
697216 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
697217 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
697218 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
697219 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients
697220 the lack of awareness of the current dietary recommendations related to fruits and vegetables is alarming and implores health experts to rethink how messages about diet and nutrition can reach this population
697221 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
697222 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
697223 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
697224 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
697225 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
697226 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications
697227 parents across the country want their teens to have a mobile phone to stay in contact but also want that phone to be used responsibly
697228 with family allowances parents get peace of mind knowing they can reach their sons and daughters without having to worry about surprise bills they can also reward their teens for responsible phone use by increasing their allowance

697340 for a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin real life
697341 i believe the simple act of making something anything with your hands is a quiet political ripple in a world dominated by mass production and people choosing to make something themselves will turn those small ripples into giant waves faythe levine
697342 craft is political were not just trying to sell stuff were trying to change the world we want everyone to rethink corporate culture and consumerism
697343 to remind people a little of their own childhood when we all thought it was possible that objects had feelings and thoughts
697344 i spoke to my mom about it shes a quaker who lives very simply and i really look up to her
697345 i thought she would say yes you are making things for the elite but instead she told me it was ok to make money for something i spent a lot of time on she said its not that we shouldnt have nice things its that we shouldnt have as many things i decided i could participate in the model of making things intensely with consideration and making things that will last
697346 while i want to give the viewer a feeling that something about it is unacceptable i also want my work to be visually pleasing
697347 there are makers who include political themes in the name of their business or taglines as well as make objects that express a political viewpoint with the imagery or text then there are the people who are less loud about it and work exclusively with recycled materials donate a percentage of their profit to a cause or only work with organic products
697348 completely about community not politics its about a lifestyle that is political but in a fairly apolitical way i think a lot of people involved in craft fair craft are good at making things they wanted to make some extra money and then they met other crafty people and got involved in a self feeding community they kind of got sucked into the community something that wasnt a political statement becomes political in that the people are all relying on each other to create something sort of off the grid
697349 i believe the simple act of making something anything with your hands is a quiet political ripple in a world dominated by mass production consumerism and commercialism and that people choosing to make something themselves will turn those small ripples into giant waves the power of doing something yourself is contagious
697350 the emphasis on commerce as opposed to ethics is taking over now

697506 chinese sport is like the military its a big hierarchy the athlete is the lowest in the hierarchy
697507 in other countries the first step is to enjoy the sport and step by step you get better
697508 but here from the beginning they say you must do sports
697509 we are at the same level or even better in terms of our facilities
697510 statistics show that 95 percent of good athletes gold medalists and world champions are from sports schools like ours
697511 all the resources and provide medical and training services to all these athletes
697512 if you are supported by your sport you have the luxury of training all day long
697513 there are many disciplines of sport where its not possible in three or four years to go from nothing to 100 you need eight or 10 years
697514 it is our countrys project on sports where we lag behind those sports categories that focus a lot on physique or body strength

697537 our laws make illegal drug abuse a priority but not legal prescription drug abuse
697538 we dont take it seriously because these drugs are legal
697539 i think i had a reputation for not being a difficult doctor in prescribing medicine
697540 if somebody comes complaining about chronic pain and they need medicine to work are you going to control it to the point where they still have a lot of pain and the ability to work is limited a lot of doctors do that and i have a more flexible view
697541 theres a definite need for doctors to treat chronic pain
697542 if we went away people would be more dependent on buying drugs off the street and illicit activity would probably get worse the problem is that people dont know they can go to legitimate doctors and have pain treated instead of buying medication off the street
697543 she was a patient for four years she had all the records and she was obviously in pain
697544 i had no idea she was selling and it typifies what we have to go through to identify what patients are legitimate
697545 if you take an entire bottle of methadone do five to six lines of cocaine take 80 milligrams of oxycontins drink two quarts of tequila and start doing amphetamines and crystal meth you might overdose
697546 when you take methadone the way doctors prescribe it its so safe its used on pregnant women
697547 he could go around and get any prescription he wanted and no matter how much money he earned he used it for prescription drugs
697548 they have pain clinics right next to probation offices why is that allowed
697549 you dont have to spend a lot of time with each patient youre not doing surgery and youre talking about a very specific group of systems is the pain in your back shoulder etc and then you write a prescription for some pain pills or muscle relaxers
697550 people that lose a loved one are always looking for a reason other than the real reason why the person overdosed
697551 its usually because of personality disorders conflicts unresolved issues arguments
697552 we have to be able to trust the system sometimes within the system people fall down parents dont keep on eye on kids they havent raised their kids right they let them run rampant they dont take them to church or teach them morals they put coca cola in their bottles they enable kids to hang out and not do homework and then the kid turns out to be a drug addict and its the doctors fault
697553 you have to be able to demonstrate that they did this with intent to break a law and thats not an easy thing to do

697590 houston is home to the johnson space center obama has said he wants to postpone nasas constellation program for five years should that happen the gap between the end of the shuttle program and flight testing of a new spacecraft would exceed 10 years years with no u s ability to fly humans in space would obama really force such a gap deterring americans from pursuing careers in space science and crippling the u s space program for a generation
697591 i think the constellation project is a bold vision but we havent thought through all the steps to get there and what the funding sources are
697592 barack obama is planning to unveil an education plan today that would make affordable pre school programs more widely available and offer pay incentive programs for effective teachers
697593 though obama called for a renewed investment in math and science education his plan would actually pull money from the federal governments greatest investments and achievements in math and science obama would delay funding for the nasa constellation program for five years though he would maintain the 500 million in funding the program would receive for its manufacturing and technology base in order to help fund his education policy the campaign did not say how much money delaying the program would provide

697659 the nature of the first generation of stars in the universe remains largely unknown observations imply the existence of massive primordial stars early in the history of the universe and the standard theory for the growth of cosmic structure predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability we have developed an ab initio computer simulation of the formation of primordial stars that follows the relevant atomic and molecular processes in a primordial gas in an expanding universe the results show that primeval density fluctuations left over from the big bang can drive the formation of a tiny protostar with a mass of just one percent that of the sun the protostar is a seed for the subsequent formation of a massive primordial star

697666 the arizona senator who has been a strong supporter of the surge echoed the misgivings of the us military about the british move telling reporters he

697669 overall democrats were the focus of 46 of the election stories last week while republicans were close behind at 42
697670 i have just logged here a third occurrence in about 24 hours of the phrase
697671 i am a republican because like you i want to relieve the american people of the heavy hand of a government
697672 i am a republican because like you i believe government must defend our nations security wisely and effectively i am a republican because i believe like you that government should tax us no more than necessary spend no more than necessary i am a republican because i believe the judges we appoint to the federal bench must understand that enforcing our laws not making them is their only responsibility
697673 mccain wins over romney as the second choice of huckabee voters by more than a 2 to 1 margin 64 to 28 indeed mccain beats romney 42 to 24 with huckabee in the race huckabee gets 18 of the vote ron paul gets 5 and alan keyes gets 2 with a narrowed down ballot focused just on mccain and romney forcing huckabee voters to choose between the two front runners mccain wins 53 to 30 a slightly expanded margin
697674 both senators hillary clinton and barack obama have seductively hinted that they would withdraw almost all u s troops within 12 to 16 months but if either of them actually did that he or she would instantly make iraq the consuming partisan fight of their presidency
697675 and you pull out according to that time table regardless of the situation even if theres serious sectarian violence
697676 no i always reserve as commander in chief the right to assess the situation
697677 a light will shine through that window a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
697678 be not afraid for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people for there is born to you this day in the city of chicago a savior who is barack the democrat
697679 getting increasingly weirded out by some of obamas supporters on listservs im on some people who should know better hard bitten not so young cynics even are gushing about barack
697680 excuse me but this sounds more like a cult than a political campaign
697681 depressing the private sector depresses the well being of all
697682 cannot allow the next president to retreat in the face of evil extremism
697683 if i believe the country will suffer with either hillary obama or mccain i would just as soon the democrats take the hit rather than a republican causing the debacle
697684 and i would prefer not to have conservative republicans in the congress paralyzed by having to support out of party loyalty a republican president who is not conservative
697685 i am deeply disappointed the republican party seems poised to select a nominee who did not support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage voted for embryonic stem cell research to kill nascent human beings opposed tax cuts that ended the marriage penalty has little regard for freedom of speech organized the gang of 14 to preserve filibusters in judicial hearings and has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language
697686 whether we like it or not democrats are closer to the majority view on iraq the success of the surge has reduced the salience of iraq as an issue damaging the gop but that has not made it an issue that wins votes for the gop so it did no damage for hillary and obama to discuss it endlessly and their disagreement who is most reliably determined to leave will not anger their supporters or most uncommitted voters
697687 i wouldnt pretend otherwise and you wouldnt let me forget
697688 whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice neither in my opinion is safe
697689 the true danger is when liberty is nibbled away for expedience and by parts

697698 the clintons themselves are street fighters trained in the tough school of alabama politics but they do not fight dirty unless they have to they were fighting dirty because they were fighting scared

697700 the future of the transatlantic relationship lies in confronting the challenges of the twenty first century worldwide developing a common energy policy creating a transatlantic common market tying our economies more closely together and institutionalizing our cooperation on issues such as climate change foreign assistance and democracy promotion
697701 25 of the uk is suppose to be on the dole is that true
697702 the guy is brave a hero in war and captivity he has demonstrated the courage of his convictions in peacetime as well on iraq he was right when donald rumsfeld and president bush were wrong if the war ends well it will be john mccain as much as general petraeus who will deserve the credit he has devoted his political career to readying himself for the job of commander in chief his judgments on war and peace have been vindicated no american understands better the sacrifices that are asked of fighting soldiers no american has a better right to ask in his turn for the devotion that he offered in his time of all the remaining candidates only john mccain is running as a war leader and a war leader is what is most sorely needed by a nation at war
697703 if you get endorsed by the new york times youre probably not a conservative
697704 has this ever happened before this is kind of amazing im looking at cnn exit polls at the numbers for self identified republicans mccain lost self identified republicans by a point in new hampshire oddly he won registered republicans he lost self identified republicans by 14 points in michigan and he tied among self identified republicans in south carolina and florida in other words mccain is close to the presumptive nominee gop nominee without having won self identified republican voters anywhere what an extraordinary and utterly unlikely path to the nomination presumably with his front runner status enhanced mccain will now begin to win self identified republicans but he has pulled the political equivalent of an inside straight to get here
697705 they need a presidential candidate who is willing support an attack on iran and mccain will do nicely
697706 its an excellent movie and its got information in it i didnt know before

697724 wir haben einen anderen hinterreifen gew hlt und es ist dann ganz gut gelaufen
697725 ich bin mit dem zweiten rang zufrieden kiyo war heute sehr stark aber ich will wieder gewinnen es war gut f r das team dass wir wieder einmal beide auf dem podium stehen konnten
697726 man konnte fast den eindruck haben wir waren gar nicht dabei
697727 herr theissen wie w rden sie das heutige rennen zusammenfassen
697728 das rennen ist komplett an uns vorbeigelaufen man konnte fast den eindruck haben wir waren gar nicht dabei wir waren einfach langsam zu keinem zeitpunkt konnte einer der beiden fahrer die rundenzeiten fahren die wir von gestern her kennen und f r normal halten und erwarten konnten sowohl auf den harten als auch auf den weichen reifen die ursache ist f r uns derzeit nicht klar wir werden jetzt die n chsten tage das thema analysieren
697729 das heute war das schlechteste resultat seit zwei jahren glaube ich stimmt das
697730 ja es war wirklich weit weg von der pace robert ist sogar zeitweise die langsamsten runden im feld gefahren nat rlich ist das v llig unerwartet und passt mit dem was wir noch gestern gesehen haben berhaupt nicht zusammen
697731 robert sagt die erste runde war schon schlimm aber dann wurde es nur noch schlimmer
697732 der f nfte startplatz ist besser als der vierte weil er auf der sauberen seite ist
697733 da haben wir uns gestern schon sorgen gemacht denn hier ist der unterschied zwischen der sauberen und der schmutzigen fahrbahnseite recht gro der f nfte startplatz ist besser als der vierte weil er auf der sauberen seite ist wir wussten dass es sehr schwierig werden w rden die position gegen timo in der ersten kurve zu verteidigen ich wei nicht ob robert wheelspin hatte aber sein start war nicht perfekt
697734 das kann man nicht sagen wir sind hier in den letzten zwei jahren auf dem podium gewesen also muss es schon etwas anderes sein wir gehen davon aus dass es im wechselspiel zwischen reifen strecke und fahrzeug liegt es war nicht nur so dass wir langsam waren sondern wir waren auch nicht konstant wir haben bei anderen gesehen zum beispiel bei ferrari dass der eine viel besser vorankam als der andere irgendwas ist da was wir noch nicht verstehen
697735 k nnte es ein vergleichbares problem wie in magny cours gewesen sein wo es spezielle streckenbedingungen gegeben hat oder war es etwas ganz anderes
697736 es k nnte eine verbindung zu dem geben was wir in magny cours gesehen haben aber daf r ist es noch zu fr h offensichtlich hatte es in beiden f llen mit den reifen zu tun damit wie wir sie zum arbeiten bringen ob es das gleiche problem war wie in magny cours kann ich jetzt aber noch nicht sagen in magny cours waren wir wenigstens konstant da wussten wir am samstag was am sonntag m glich sein w rde das war hier anders
697737 sie haben den zweiten platz in der konstrukteurs wm an mclaren mercedes verloren kann man den zur ckerobern
697738 mit der heutigen leistung und punkteausbeute sicher nicht aber nat rlich werden wir jetzt nicht das gas aus der saison rausnehmen wir haben noch einige entwicklungen im rohr und die werden auch kommen aber nach einem rennen wie dem heutigen k nnen wir nicht sagen dass wir die beiden topteams herausfordern werden
697739 so wie heute kann die situation nicht bleiben was planen sie f r die n chsten wochen
697740 wir haben noch einige entwicklungen in der pipeline sowohl auf aerodynamischer seite wie auch bei der mechanik die werden wir bringen wir werden nicht wegen eines solchen ergebnisses die weiterentwicklung des diesj hrigen autos zur ckfahren
697741 was wir heute gesehen haben hat definitiv nichts mit den fahrern zu tun
697742 vorher hatte zumindest ein fahrer gewisse probleme nun scheint es das auto zu sein
697743 naja gestern war das qualifying bei nick auch nicht das was er erwartet hat das hat im prinzip schon daf r gesorgt dass er heute keine punkte holen konnte was wir heute gesehen haben hat aber definitiv nichts mit den fahrern zu tun
697744 robert war auf einem stopp nick auf zwei hat das in keinster weise irgendetwas positives bewirkt
697745 das w rde ich so nicht sagen der zweistopper war f r robert die absolut richtige strategie das war f r mich klar bei nick war es so dass wir mit einem zweistopper auf jeden fall da hinten geblieben w ren aber mit dem einstopper hatten wir die chance dass wir nach vorne kommen falls ein safety car kommt wir haben also diese einstoppstrategie gezielt in richtung safety car aufgesetzt weil klar war wenn es nicht kommt kann er sowieso nicht in die punkte fahren
697746 das n chste rennen in valencia ist f r alle neuland wie bereiten sie sich darauf vor
697747 dank eines gro artigen starts bist du an robert kubica vorbeigekommen erz hle uns etwas dar ber
697748 ich musste mich selbst etwas in bezug auf den start verbessern denn meine reaktionszeit war in den ersten paar rennen nicht perfekt ich habe mich diesbez glich einfach selbst verbessert die start zeit war wirklich wirklich gut und ich konnte robert ausbeschleunigen und hatte eine gute erste kurve
697749 im letzten abschnitt des rennens sah ich dass ich neun sekunden vor kimi liege und eine ordentliche geschwindigkeit habe aber sie sagten mir dass er um f nf zehntelsekunden pro runde schneller war ich versuchte einfach mehr und mehr druck zu machen und zerst rte mir dabei die reifen jedes mal ich musste mich also wirklich auf die reifen konzentrieren und es einfach locker angehen ruhig bleiben und mich durch kimi nicht zu sehr unter druck setzen lassen
697750 h ttest du dir dieses ergebnis jemals vorstellen k nnen
697751 als ich sah dass ich um neun sekunden vor kimi liege da dachte ich mir okay ich kann etwas schneller fahren 21 8 oder 21 9 und vielleicht kann ich ihn hinter mir halten aber ich kann keine 21 fahren ich fuhr 22 2 oder 22 mitte
697752 ich war f r kimi einfach zu langsam und er holte in riesigen schritten auf mich auf aber ich wusste dass es hier wirklich schwierig sein w rde zu berholen ich versuchte aus diesem grund einfach keine fehler zu machen und vor ihm zu bleiben am ende ist der zweite platz f r das team einfach perfekt und f r die konstrukteurswertung wirklich wichtig das ist wirklich gut
697753 du hast im mittleren abschnitt des rennens auf heikki aufgeholt hatte dies etwas mit verkehr zu tun
697754 der mittlere abschnitt des rennens war ziemlich gut mit den h rteren reifen hatten wir das gesamte wochenende ber eine wirklich gute geschwindigkeit als heikki in verkehr kam ich denke das war ein paar runden sp ter hatte ich dasselbe problem es ist wirklich schwierig dicht genug heranzukommen so dass sie die blauen flaggen sehen und zur seite gehen das ist f r diese strecke charakteristisch und das gestaltete es etwas schwieriger
697755 was hat sich f r dich deiner meinung nach ver ndert dass es pl tzlich so gut l uft
697756 in hockenheim hatten wir in bezug auf das tempo im rennen ein wirklich gutes auto ich mag kein auto das untersteuert und es war in dieser saison manchmal ein problem dass das auto zu sehr untersteuert hat in hockenheim und hier ging es einfach mehr und mehr in meine richtung ich kann das auto so in die kurve bringen wie ich das m chte und es passt mehr zu meinem fahrstil das habe ich hier im qualifying und auch im rennen gezeigt
697757 dein stopp dauerte 13 sekunden oder so hattest du geplant dass er so lange dauert oder gab es ein problem
697758 ich fragte was das problem war ich hatte das gef hl dass der tank schlauch nicht richtig sa aber ich erhielt keine antwort mir wurde gesagt dass wir dies nach dem rennen besprechen vielleicht hielt ich etwas zu fr h an und sie konnten den tank schlauch nicht ansetzen das m ssen wir diskutieren und analysieren es kostete uns drei oder vier sekunden

697766 luis alberto jim nez an illegal immigrant injured in a car accident in florida was treated at a community hospital which eventually sent him back to guatemala he spends most of his days inside a one room house only the presence of visitors who can help him into his wheelchair gives him the rare chance to get out of bed
697767 the cartoon issue really really hurt muslims around the world
697768 een lege plek om te blijven ga nu maar liggen liefste in de tuin de lege plekken in het hoge gras ik heb altijd gewild dat ik dat was
697769 if men can run the world why cant they stop wearing neckties how intelligent is it to start the day by tying a little noose around your neck
697770 does my ex still love me can i ask them
697771 cest comme une petite balle avec des petits points qui est en moi qui nage en quelque sorte en moi
697772 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
697773 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
697774 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
697775 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
697776 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
697777 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
697778 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
697779 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
697780 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
697781 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
697782 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
697783 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
697784 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
697785 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
697786 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
697787 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time
697788 more and more of these drones and reduce the manned fighters and bombers overhead
697789 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
697790 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
697791 the earth is the lords and everything in it the world and all its people belong to him for he laid the earths foundation on the seas and built it on the ocean depths
697792 who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that jesus is the son of god
697793 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you id suggest we could start with aragorn
697794 the earth is the lords and everything in it the world and all its people belong to him for he laid the earths foundation on the seas and built it on the ocean depths
697795 with a premise that sweeping and stupid sounding i need to state some caveats of course
697796 everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom
697797 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
697798 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
697799 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
697800 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
697801 at least 15 militants were killed and many injured in an exchange of fire with security forces near sij bund in matta district
697802 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
697803 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
697804 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
697805 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
697806 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
697807 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
697808 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
697809 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less
697810 the fire is continuing while being generally brought under control
697811 the weather was on our side last night but the wind began blowing again this morning still we aim to bring the fire under control today
697812 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
697813 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
697814 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
697815 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
697816 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues
697817 but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
697818 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
697819 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
697820 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
697821 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
697822 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
697823 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
697824 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
697825 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
697826 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
697827 i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards and i hope he will be the nominee
697828 for senator mccain to demean the race for the presidency in this way is not i think humorous i think its silly
697829 but i will say this lets take it back to the american people
697830 i have no idea what hes saying or what he means soaring rhetoric feel good persona ever changing positions
697831 the reason were not in town hall meetings testing these two candidates is because barack obama doesnt want to be tested
697832 has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
697833 with a southern lilt and a talent for raw politics cantor is one of the nations most prominent jewish republicans he has impressed the mccain team by becoming a prolific fundraiser for the campaign
697834 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
697835 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
697836 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
697837 we may not have put an end to all our problems
697838 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
697839 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
697840 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
697841 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that make up the feathers
697842 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
697843 if the study results are good then we will apply for a patent and publish the study
697844 the next step would be to form a partnership with a company that can maximise this technology perhaps local food giant san miguel corp which has purefoods as a subsidiary company and through purefoods operates large poultry farms nationwide
697845 proud to be involved in such an exciting and ecologically relevant project
697846 our support for this endeavour underscores our commitment to finding sustainable solutions in protecting and maintaining our environment
697847 poverty and despair are the forgotten issues in americass presidential race
697848 la pobreza y la desesperaci n son los grandes olvidados en la carrera presidencial norteamericana
697849 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
697850 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
697851 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
697852 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
697853 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
697854 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
697855 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
697856 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
697857 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
697858 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
697859 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
697860 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
697861 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
697862 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
697863 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
697864 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
697865 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
697866 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
697867 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
697868 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
697869 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
697870 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
697871 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
697872 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
697873 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
697874 we will raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
697875 im running for this office because i want to make life better i dont think has done a good enough job
697876 anybody who goes to congress can bring home the dollars
697877 its her son but its got nothing to do with her
697878 is part of a larger political machine that will be able to turn out primary voters
697879 hey baby let me show you the sixth lion in my pants
697880 time sharing will now be used again this is an attempt by the courts to make sure that both parents play a larger or more equal role in a childs life
697881 un gran n mero de gente estaba confinada en una zona peque a
697882 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
697883 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
697884 qualunque cosa succeda ci diceva nostro padre noi dobbiamo superarla
697885 and have the odds in your favor of being successful in catching something
697886 even during the peak seasons when other places are increasing rates by 25 or more by karen lovendahl premier beach vacations
697887 youll have some lazy traders thatll be unusually disturbed by things that maybe wouldnt have the same kind of exaggerated effect on prices
697888 it leaves the market vulnerable to some unusual moves and sometimes the moves cant be justified other than the fact that a lot of the participants have gone away
697889 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
697890 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward
697891 because of those two things the market has turned into an emotional rollercoaster
697892 we think that in june there will be a last gasp boost to income from the remainder of the stimulus cheques
697893 as a result personal income and spending are likely to be subdued
697894 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
697895 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
697896 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less
697897 im not even sure actors are directable i think the more you know the less you try to direct them the more you just try to not impede
697898 ya est en internet el sitio de noticias del gobierno
697899 con el lanzamiento de la p gina de noticias tambi n estamos cumpliendo con un acuerdo al que hemos llegado con el sindicato de prensa de r o grande en el sentido de concentrar la informaci n en un sitio web y tender a la eliminaci n de las gacetillas de prensa
697900 no nos interesa en este punto cr tico de la provincia y de la relaci n entre el gobierno y la prensa detenernos en desmentidas pero s dejar claro ante ud la posici n del sindicato en todo momento constructiva y con la intenci n de encauzar una pr ctica que inici en 2004 con la gesti n del fup a partir de la distribuci n de notas period sticas con fotograf as en las que se filtraba propaganda partidaria cr ticas a sectores de oposici n utilizando medios del estado con fines partidarios cobertura de informaci n ajena al mbito gubernamental hasta lleg a distribuirse por medios un parte policial por lo cual las denominadas gacetillas o notas de prensa se desvirtuaron como tales y oportunamente ameritaron una presentaci n ante el fiscal de estado por parte de este gremio
697901 la revisi n del contenido y la forma en que se distribuyen las gacetillas como tambi n de la cantidad de mensajes que se env an con reiteraci n de conceptos en detrimento de la falta de informaci n sobre otras reas del gobierno cuyas actividades son de relevancia p blica a la fecha y en cantidad creciente en cuatro meses llevamos recopilados 1 330 mensajes enviados por mail por la secretar a de comunicaci n institucional a un promedio de una docena diaria de comunicaciones que en m nima proporci n son informaci n a la comunidad sobre actos de gobierno y casi en su totalidad reflejan opiniones de funcionarios sobre la coyuntura en general sobre conflictos sindicales
697902 revisi n sobre cantidad y calidad de ninguna manera es eliminaci n
697903 la correcci n de malas pr cticas es lo que en otras reas se comprometi a realizar el ari y medios es una en las que persiste en el error que intentamos se alar y que a la luz de las declaraciones del secretario ramonet no fue comprendido
697904 eliminar datos in tiles o redundantes informaci n sobre otras ideas o personas ajenos al tema central del comunicado
697905 what it does is it takes a very difficult and confusing process and makes it easier for people to understand
697906 theyre really providing a value to people to understand whats going on even though its not the prettiest site to look at it seems to meet the needs of its users and thats what it comes done to meeting customers needs
697907 theyve done a good job in understanding what the people who visit the fbi are looking for
697908 it comes down to knowing what your users want and getting it to them in an easy straightforward fashion
697909 e government has stopped the bleeding for now in terms of citizen satisfaction but it remains to be seen if this is a blip or the beginning of a positive trend
697910 what is evidently clear however is that improving online satisfaction can drive traffic to the web channel investment in the online channel will pay itself off and result in increased efficiency and happy citizens
697911 how big is your cauc ass its not the size that matters but how you use it
697912 the iranian nation will bloody the enemys nose if they want to violate an iota of our rights
697913 wir haben jetzt die best tigung dass 145 menschen get tet wurden
697914 weve just not discharged as many as we would because of how unwell they are
697915 that has not been a success as people are unwell and unable to be discharged
697916 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
697917 the chinese are not here as investors theyre here as invaders
697918 la parola d ordine una sola categorica e impegnativa per tutti
697919 youll catch more flies with honey than you will with shite
697920 if you listen to your fears you will die never knowing what a great person you might have been

697924 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
697925 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
697926 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
697927 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
697928 the statement which follows cannot hope to capture the mood and experience of the lambeth conference 2008
697929 cold words are inadequate to express the quality and passion of the journey we have shared we have listened intently to one another we have laughed together and wept together we have discovered in our bible study and indaba groups the kind of friendship and fellowship which is life changing
697930 this statement represents a distillation of insights and opinions not from a single group but from 16 indaba groups and it therefore takes the form of a patchwork which no editorial process can make seamless without creating a garment that never existed
697931 in order to read this document with appreciation you must allow yourself to imagine that you are in a safe space with others whom you have come to love and whose opinions you have grown to respect at the deepest level only the reader can breathe love humor tears admiration urgency and imagination into this document so that it can truly live and so that the experiences that gave it birth can be seen to have animated our renewed relationships
697932 the record is called departure for a number of reasons
697933 there have been departures in my career in my personal life ive learned a lot since doing my first couple of records i think ive landed in the most comfortable place ive ever been musically as the style of music my vocals and the lyrical content of the songs on this album i co wrote several songs on the new album and learned a lot from the producers i worked with in the process of writing for my own project i wound up writing bleeding love with ryan tedder for leona lewis departure has a little more of mature sound than what my fans previously heard from me but this is the road that im on right now and its the road that i believe theyll join with me
697934 this is a special version with no junk stuffs installed
697935 basically opencl lets you use graphics processors to do computation
697936 have different architectures pin outs and mechanical electrical and thermal characteristics
697937 top 2 primary system now voters can vote for whoever they want on the primary ballot regardless of party preference the top 2 vote getters in each partisan position then go on to the actual election
697938 it is absolutely critical to state at this point that if marketing is permitted we fully expect that additional cases of pml many likely to be fatal will occur
697939 est na parte traseira do nibus cortando peda os e os comendo
697940 junto com um passageiro que estava dormindo escutando m sica

697960 a id ia foi recriar o universo de nara le o que abrangia muito mais do que a bossa nova e inclui o samba o chorinho e as ra zes da mpb mas este assumidamente um disco pop
697961 a id ia foi do nelson motta a gente nem se conhecia ele j tinha elogiado o trabalho do pato fu e achou que eu tinha um jeito de cantar e levar a carreira muito parecido com a nara le o e curioso que ele n o sabia que eu ouvia em pequena nara le o e tinha os discos dela
697962 a produ o deste disco foi algo peculiar disse fernanda takai a gente come ou fazendo este disco trocando e mail telefonemas pois ele mora no rio de janeiro e eu em belo horizonte fomos escolhendo as m sicas eu gravei no meu est dio mandei em mp3 para ele ouvir e quando a gente deu por isso tinha um monte de m sicas as faixas todas para fazer um disco
697963 e depois de sair o disco do pato fu em julho prosseguiu estava mais a vontade para fazer o disco

697965 o grande trabalho de nara na m sica brasileira foi como int rprete que apresentava novos autores para o p blico como chico buarque ela foi uma cantora que incentivou muito a produ o musical de novos autores
697966 este lbum mostra que nara foi uma cantora al m da bossa nova e muito importante para a constru o do repert rio da mpb

697975 el gobierno tiene instrumentos adecuados de compensaci n el hecho de que ahora haya que abonar una cantidad importante de dinero se puede solucionar aplicando una serie de medidas sin que se incumpla la ley
697976 estoy convencido de que la administraci n colaborar en la medida de lo posible para establecer un precio justo buscando siempre un equilibrio entre la parte que tiene que pagar y la parte que tiene que cobrar
697977 los particulares tienen que organizarse para hallar una f rmula de negociaci n adecuada a lo mejor hay que pagar m s de lo que se recibi o la administraci n revertir m s de lo que se paga
697978 a ver quien va a pagar ahora a los vecinos la dinamita que se utiliz para volar sus casas y quien les va resarcir de todos los da os sufridos a causa del traslado
697979 compararemos el coste de una cosa y de otra y veremos quien tiene que pagar a quien
697980 en la misma situaci n que se encontraban antes de la expropiaci n
697981 existen mecanismos para brindar facilidades econ micas a los afectados y m s en una situaci n de car cter extraordinario como sta
697982 dicen que nos revierten las tierras pero las queremos en las mismas condiciones que las dejamos y eso no existe
697983 1 no es endesa la que tiene capacidad para afirmar a qu propiedades afecta o deja de afectar el proceso de reversi n eso no es la empresa la que lo tiene que decir
697984 el organismo de cuenca que tiene previsto habilitar una l nea de tel fono y una direcci n de correo exclusivas para atender a los afectados tambi n se encargar de redactar el proyecto y ejecutarlo para reponer a su estado original las zonas del rea en la que iba a levantarse la presa en las que llegaron a efectuarse obras
697985 los afectados por el proyecto de construcci n del embalse de j novas desestimado a os atr s podr n recuperar su patrimonio no s lo el que fue expropiado forzosamente sino tambi n el que fue vendido voluntariamente
697986 la confederaci n hidrogr fica del ebro ha iniciado por fin la reversi n de los terrenos expropiados para la construcci n del embalse de j novas que fue finalmente descartado en 2001 por su declaraci n de impacto ambiental negativo
697987 la devoluci n por parte de endesa de las tierras que fueron adquiridas conllevar para los antiguos propietarios la
697988 devoluci n del dinero que percibieron m s o menos actualizado ya que la persona dispondr de un terreno con caracter sticas r sticas o agr colas seg n lo que le expropiaron en su momento y evidentemente aumentar su valor patrimonial
697989 sin embargo el camino de la recuperaci n de aquellos terrenos no se presenta sencillo antes de que los antiguos propietarios puedan solicitar la reversi n la confederaci n va a estudiar con la asociaci n de afectados y el ayuntamiento a qui n dirigirse por carta para avisarle de la posibilidad de recobrar los suelos abandonados aunque se prev n que sean cientos de personas seg n jos luis alonso puesto que el plazo legal es de s lo tres meses se podr a perjudicar a gente que no se enterara y antes de abrirlo se quiere asegurar bien de los posibles beneficiarios de la medida este rastreo impedir que se se puedan presentar las solicitudes antes de que concluya este verano
697990 fuentes de la asociaci n de afectados declararon que hab a voluntad de negociaci n por su parte si bien esperan que se pueda restituir el patrimonio expropiado en las mismas condiciones en las que se entreg en su momento
697991 para que paguemos el precio actualizado por nuestras tierras tendr n que devolvernos lo mismo que les quitaron a nuestros padres y ahora all tan s lo hay ruinas
697992 habr que ver si este proceso resulta satisfactorio para todos yo en principio no tengo la intenci n de ser intransigente otra cosa es que se pueda llegar a un acuerdo satisfactorio para todos
697993 tendremos que reunirnos primero y a ver qu pasa aunque est claro que no nos lo van a regalar
697994 ni la confederaci n hidrogr fica ni endesa aportaron ayer datos sobre la superficie ni el n mero de afectados que pudieran beneficiarse de esta reversi n es m s fuentes de la compa a se refer an ayer tarde tan s lo a los expropiados no a los que vendieron sus terrenos que al parecer fueron la mayor a de quienes abandonaron el valle
697995 seg n explic ayer el comisario de aguas de la che rafael romeo despu s del verano el organismo de cuenca comunicar a los vecinos de los pueblos implicados la fecha a partir de la cual podr n solicitar la devoluci n de las tierras expropiadas
697996 vamos a crear una oficina de atenci n a los afectados que tendr n tres meses para presentar la documentaci n necesaria indic romeo
697997 el alcalde de fiscal municipio al que pertenece j novas manolo larrosa ha mostrado su satisfacci n por la noticia ya que considera que

698001 la confederaci n hidrogr fica del ebro che ha concluido el estudio para delimitar qu zona es dominio p blico hidr ulico en el rea de j novas y tiene en marcha el expediente de caducidad de la concesi n a endesa para la explotaci n del embalse del mismo nombre desestimado oficialmente en junio del a o pasado
698002 la confederaci n hidrogr fica del ebro est llevando a cabo las actuaciones necesarias para que se devuelva a los propietarios las tierras que en su d a les fueron expropiadas para la construcci n del embalse
698003 a la identificaci n catastral de quienes fueron expropiados en su momento
698004 a mediados del pr ximo a o lo que va a permitir la reversi n
698005 tras el encuentro el responsable del organismo de cuenca explic a los medios el contenido de los acuerdos alcanzados con los vecinos y sus herederos para llevar a cabo el proceso de reversi n de las propiedades expropiadas
698006 yo les he asegurado a los afectados a adi que la valoraci n econ mica no va a ser un problema y que el mayor problema que vamos a tener ser la cuesti n jur dica derivada de demostrar legalmente la identidad de todos los interesados
698007 el pistoletazo de salida para acometer el tan deseado plan de restituci n de todo el municipio de fiscal j novas lavelilla y lacort ahora protegidos en el pgou deber n ser en el futuro el reflejo de otros pueblos del municipio con los mismos servicios
698008 tenemos que mantener los lazos de comunicaci n porque los tres pueblos pertenecen al municipio de fiscal creo que es l gico que se nos escuche como afectados inici ndose as un proceso de uni n entre ayuntamiento y afectados
698009 ante un proceso de reversi n es muy importante la unidad de los afectados para lograr ese objetivo com n que es la reversi n de las tierras y el pago de las indemnizaciones en el caso de j novas un primer problema es el de los precios que quiere aplicar la che una cosa es actualizarlos pero considero que no es correcta la deriva que est tomando de fijarlos en relaci n con el valor urban stico del suelo adem s debe tenerse muy presente el da o ocasionado a esas familias cuando les obligaron a dejar sus casas y a marcharse de sus pueblos esa renovaci n mercantilista del suelo a valor casi de mercado sin contemplar apenas el drama social me parece fatal y es algo que hay que combatir cuando llegue el momento de hacer el proyecto de urbanizaci n el ayuntamiento de fiscal debe asesorarse para que no solo se contemple la recuperaci n de las casas sino que tambi n se incluyan zonas verdes y equipamientos hay que tener en cuenta que la recuperaci n no ha de hacerse con criterios del antiguo urbanismo que no atend a a intereses sociales que ahora son necesarios adem s me parece importante que la comarca u otras instituciones de mayor rango controlen el proceso y adem s a la che se le debe exigir que restaure las zonas destruidas

698344 ent o minha quest o ser que todas as pessoas teriam mais prazer se optassem pela poligamia
698345 se ele tivesse refletido se tivesse se livrado dos ci mes supondo isto poss vel seguramente h casos em que seria mais feliz esse meu ponto
698346 se ela tivesse refletido se tivesse se livrado da poligamia supondo isto poss vel seguramente h casos em que seria mais feliz esse meu ponto
698347 a monogamia est a oficialmente imposta pela lei e pela moral de maneira que se confessar polig mico ainda gera julgamentos autom ticos e exclus o social
698348 agora quando eu tento julgar conscienciosamente as pessoas dando me ao trabalho de entend las perguntar como sentem as pessoas se ofendem dez vezes mais por qu porque sou minoria tudo nosso senso moral s v como sagrado um valor sustentado pela maioria assim que nossa cogni o funciona
698349 nosso senso moral s v como sagrado um valor sustentado pela maioria assim que nossa cogni o funciona
698350 por tr s do inc modo tamb m est a suposi o absurda de que cada um sabe exatamente como maximizar o seu pr prio prazer e de que imposs vel as pessoas se enganarem em suas escolhas pessoais
698351 a verdade bem diferente somos geneticamente programados para o auto engano e a parcialidade de maneira que comum as pessoas nos conhecerem melhor do que n s mesmos o homem comum passa pela vida sem reflex o fazendo cegamente o que o instinto do momento lhe diz essa a pior maneira de buscar o prazer vide post sobre fam lia
698352 meu palpite por fim que a poligamia exatamente o tipo de escolha inteligente capaz de maximizar enormemente o prazer e que no devido tempo as pessoas v o descobrir isto
698353 basta saber como a paix o funciona iludindo o c rebro e quais seus absurdos fundamentos evolutivos
698354 se ele tivesse refletido se tivesse se livrado dos ci mes supondo isto poss vel seguramente h casos em que seria mais feliz esse meu ponto
698355 se ela tivesse refletido se tivesse se livrado da poligamia supondo isto poss vel seguramente h casos em que seria mais feliz esse meu ponto
698356 falta de imagina o comida sexo e gua causam prazer universal
698357 s se x variasse em 2 popula es id nticas
698358 voc por outro lado tem sim dificuldades em conceber a possibilidade de que ela seja melhor pra todos seu ponto que eu deveria achar isso imposs vel e ponto final
698359 e se formos constru dos do mesmo modo afinal imposs vel pois me parece prov vel somos da mesma esp cie e mesmo levando em conta influ ncias culturais que eu minimizo pacas estamos sob a mesma cultura
698360 dado que somos da mesma esp cie e estamos sob a mesma cultura temos vis es opostas sobre esse assunto
698361 bvio que voc tem mais ci mes de quem voc tem mais medo de perder medo de perder algu m por sua vez algo que coincide o suficiente com o amor para que as pessoas se importem faz pleno sentir gostar que tenham ci mes de voc se voc est inseguro na rela o
698362 eu sou t o bom que aguento ter voc s pra mim
698363 aceitar quem voc n o pode fingir que n o h conflito o monog mico aceita os ci mes do outro mas n o aceita os desejos o polig mico aceita os desejos do outro mas n o os ci mes imposs vel ter tudo a quest o continua de p o que traz mais prazer e o que traz mais sofrimento
698364 voc dizer que toda moral come a como um ataque maioria o modo perfeito de mostrar que tenho raz o oras
698365 nossa moral s v como sagrado aquilo que sustentado pela maioria
698366 evolutivamente fomos dotados com a tend ncia de seguir automaticamente qualquer x adotado pela maioria
698367 o resto bvio se todos tem uma vis o relativamente falsa de si mesmos claro est o em vantagem sobre os outros n o dif cil de entender as outras pessoas podem ver seu rosto voc n o
698368 queria deixar claro que raz o pra mim apenas isso a maneira de atingir objetivos de saciar desejos
698369 o que n s temos s o instintos iguais que reagem de formas diferentes s conting ncias do ambiente e da cultura
698370 mais uma coisa que n o mais potente que propaganda na tv faz voc querer fazer algo
698371 que direito voc tem de dizer que aquele escravo poderia ser mais feliz livre da natureza ou da cultura dele servir n o estrague isso voc est apenas querendo se convencer de que por que voc livre melhor que ele
698372 ah n o use seu exemplo pessoal a seu favor sinto essas coisas e n o tenho ciumes alguma explica o 1 porque n o preciso acreditar voc n o acreditou que minhas rela es s o felizes livres e sem riscos de acabar e 2 porque um exemplo particular nada diz se eu afirmar que a m dia de altura da popula o de 1 70m n o venha contestar isto me dizendo que voc ou fulano de tal tem 2 30m
698373 instintos s o emo es e desejos b sicos inatos e universais tes o ci mes medo raiva sede fome desejo de vingan a gosto por status vaidade orgulho inveja vergonha gratid o culpa paix o dio etc
698374 raz o intelig ncia meio de satisfazer os instintos saciar desejos atingir objetivos nenhum desejo ou instinto racional ou irracional se por um defeito neurol gico desejas transar com mesas isto existe procur las racional
698375 n o porque todos gostam de m sicas diferentes que vamos negar que todos gostam de m sica ent o como poss vel que todas as pessoas do mundo gostem de se embalar por ritmos e melodias e voc chegue conclus o de que n o h nada de universal nesse prazer
698376 e ir nico j que as propagandas que s o influenciadas por nossos instintos e n o o contr rio por isso tantas mulheres belas e seminuas em vez de nos manipularem a gostar de velhas nuas que no come o sairia bem mais barato
698377 agora e isso muito s rio de onde voc tirou que eu me acho geneticamente mais evolu do
698378 o que minha pergunta faz justamente tentar abrir a mente das pessoas para a possibilidade de que a poligamia seja melhor e elas n o estejam vendo isso gra as repress o cultural
698379 a repress o da escravid o n o sumiu por milhares de anos e sem d vida s sumiu porque os inconformistas se perguntavam
698380 que direito voc tem de dizer que aquele escravo poderia ser mais feliz livre da natureza ou da cultura dele servir n o estrague isso voc est apenas querendo se convencer de que por que voc livre melhor que ele
698381 voc s s o crian as est pidas que n o sabem o que faz eis a f rmula para ti
698382 olha s existe esse outro estilo de vida que talvez voc goste

698422 as morning dawned the angels urged lot saying up take your wife and your two daughters who are here lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city but he lingered so the angels seized him and his wife and two daughters by the hand the lord being merciful to him and they brought him out and set him outside the city
698423 therefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered outside the gate so let us go out to him outside the city bearing his reproach
698424 but hark the herald of the sun the auroral wind softly trumpeting his approach the master minister of the human tabernacle is at hand heaping before his prow a huge ripple fretted wave of crimson and gold he rushes aloft as if newly launched from the urging hand of his maker into the upper sea pauses and looks down on the world white raving storm of molten metals he is but a coal from the altar of the fathers never ending sacrifice to his children see every little flower straighten its stalk lift up its neck and with out stretched head stand expectant something more than the sun greater than the light is coming is coming nonetheless surely coming that it is long upon the road what matters today or tomorrow or ten thousand years to life himself to love himself he is coming is coming and the necks of all humanity are stretched out to see him come every morning will they thus outstretch themselves every evening will they droop and wait until he comes is this but an air drawn vision when he comes will he indeed find them watching thus it was a glorious resurrection morning the night had been spent in preparing it

698473 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
698474 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
698475 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the
698476 by speaking out i hope we encouraged people to put more effort into keeping northern rock open
698477 the attitude was why should we take this lying down
698478 northern rock had given a lot to the community so people wanted to give something back by showing support
698479 what was interesting was that people in the region became aware of their own power
698480 in previous decades there would have been the supposition that northern rock would have had to close and all the jobs would have to be lost
698481 local mps got involved in the fight and the message was put very forcibly to the government in london
698482 of course some people were not happy and some of the feedback we got said northern rock should be allowed to die
698483 but you can still believe in a free market and believe it was right to save northern rock
698484 with hindsight there was no sense at the time that the board was acting recklessly in any way
698485 it may have looked like mr applegarth got out at the right time but there have been big failures in the city of london who have been generously rewarded and no one raises criticism
698486 there has been a lot of hot air around northern rock in my opinion the fsa checks were not stringent enough they failed to look closely enough at northern rock
698487 there are a lot of things up here where northern rock has played a big role in the community
698488 things are not going to be the same on sponsorship that is for sure
698489 the football club will find other sponsors but the question would be what about the rugby club their ground is also owned by northern rock
698490 without backing from northern rock it would have to examine how it can continue they may have to look to a more utilitarian approach with stars
698491 people in the region think nationalisation is a holding position
698492 and nobody really knows where this will go next or indeed if northern rock will survive in the long term
698493 i dont think we are at the end of the beginning because nobody really knows where this will go
698494 when the round of redundancies is completed there will be a remaining workforce of about 4 000 there are currently vacancies in the financial sector in the north east that may be able to take up some of the people who are losing their jobs
698495 it is a better scenario compared to the one where we might have had 5 000 plus jobs going
698496 we think the lobbying of politicians and the chancellor was helpful and i also believe that going into nationalisation saved the company
698497 however we can now look to the future it is important to focus on that from both a commercial and morale point of view
698498 one of the things we found out about northern rock was how much people in the region looked at it as though it was their business it is a big part of the north east
698499 it is part of the regional culture the regional mps recognised that was the case as much as the value of the company job losses had to be kept to a minimum
698500 i think the rest of the country did not quite realise how important it was to the region
698501 the case of northern rock has been overshadowed by what has come afterwards

698510 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios

698532 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
698533 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay

698536 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
698537 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
698538 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
698539 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

698638 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
698639 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
698640 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
698641 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
698642 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
698643 its extremely time consuming and expensive to validate genotype testing
698644 however we probably will be testing these areas in a couple of years
698645 it appears that higher quality articles in other words more citable articles are simply made freely available
698646 previous studies using different methods simply got cause and effect reversed
698647 the established dogma is that freely available scientific articles are cited more because they are read more
698648 we found that open access publishing may reach more readers than subscription access publishing but there is no evidence that freely accessible articles are cited any more than subscription access articles
698649 there were definitely more article downloads for freely accessible articles
698650 yet nearly half of these downloads were by internet indexing robots like google crawling the web for free content
698651 there are many reasons to provide free access to the literature
698652 geological maps are essential tools in finding natural resources e g water hydrocarbons and minerals and when planning to mitigate geohazards e g earthquakes volcanoes and radon natural resources are a crucial source of wealth for all nations especially those that need to develop and build their economies identifying geohazards is often a matter of life or death other challenges facing all nations in the 21st century include rising sea levels management of waste nuclear or domestic and storage of carbon knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial
698653 today you can go to the onegeology website and get geological maps from across the globe from an overview of our entire planet to larger scale maps of the rocks of individual nations you also have the ability to hop from this web site to higher resolution applied maps and data on linked national web sites participating nations are contributing to a legacy for humankind by acting locally they are thinking globally
698654 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
698655 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
698656 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active
698657 the timing of taking antioxidants may be critical for the control of appetite
698658 if taken on an empty stomach antioxidants may further increase appetite however when taken with food they may affect satiety further studies are needed to determine whether any regiment of orally taken antioxidants could be used to control appetite in animals and humans
698659 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
698660 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
698661 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease

698730 we just had a girl leave in june who had been with us for a year and she went to live with relatives

698732 there have been times when weve had to call the police and had children removed
698733 but at least when they leave us they have a memory of what life was like with us weve shown them what it is to be loved and that is enough

698749 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
698750 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward

698849 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
698850 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
698851 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
698852 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists

698870 i want a president who is committed to civil rights
698871 we can be slow as well to give greatness its due a mistake i made myself long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king
698872 i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in arizona we can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing and dr king understood this about his fellow americans but he knew as well that in the long term confidence in the reasonability and good heart of america is always well placed
698873 i voted against it on grounds that were not sound that we didnt need to spend the money or whatever but a very short time after that i changed my view because i was informed

698895 the presidency has noted todays sunday front page article of the sunday times headlined mbeki took r30m and gave some to anc president jacob zuma
698896 the report which purports to be a result of a six months investigation is but a hotch potch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
698897 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain that president thabo mbeki received a bribe of r30m from man ferrostaal
698898 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
698899 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
698900 by the way the mystique attached to this information starts to ring hollow given that information about these competitors is easily available on the internet
698901 in other words what is meant to be a six months investigation by the sunday times turns out to be peddling of information among competing companies including in its own words a number of arms dealers who were involved in bidding for the south african contracts
698902 its grotesque allegation that zuma acted as mbekis front man during the arms deal negotiations particularly in the context of the court process currently under way
698903 whereas the article acknowledges that it is based on allegations the papers editorial the arms deal truth must out once and for all openly attaches truth to the allegations
698904 the unstated premise of the editorial is that the allegations are truthful because the sunday times says so
698905 by readily regurgitating known and spurious allegations supposedly after six months of a laborious investigation while at the same time concealing easy to find information which casts doubt on the credibility of its article the paper appears to be pursuing an agenda that it only can explain
698906 the danger exists that journalism which plays an important role in any democracy may ultimately become a rumour industry in which any and every allegation finds its way in the pages of newspapers thus stripping the profession of the legitimacy that it must enjoy in pursuit of its role
698907 president mbeki must now explain himself to the nation in a televised address without delay we have the right to hear his side of the story
698908 he has the right to tell his side of the story but we want the whole truth and nothing but the truth
698909 whether he admits or denies the allegation the president must appoint a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a judge of impeccable reputation and with full powers of subpoena to fully investigate every aspect of the arms deal
698910 but we are not surprised can we trust the anc leadership both mbeki and zuma mbeki and the anc have been asked many times to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry
698911 it explains why the newly elected lynch mob that controls the anc is reluctant to trust the judiciary because they are aware of these shady dealings and schemes

698986 but on the way there i decided to scrap it and just speak from the heart i spoke to them about how i feel about israel and they reacted respectfully
698987 we went beyond just having interfaith events and just dialogue to acting together to bring our communities together and we became friends we even have inside jokes
698988 many towns in new jersey had it in their deeds that jews werent allowed to live there

698998 for many in my community it was unexpected support they saw
698999 i had some positive experiences and some negative experiences with arabs
699000 he said this was our house and he was crying
699001 a jewish family was living there israel just took our homes
699002 when i met senter for the first time it was new there is the history always of the muslims and jews in the history of palestine theres the conflict the misunderstandings
699003 he had the cap and the robe he was the image i had seen on tv of hamas leaders talking about the rockets theyd fired at israel i shook his hand but reluctantly
699004 when i first heard about the torture i couldnt believe it
699005 that kind of treatment is clearly not a jewish value
699006 quoting the quran out of context in an effort to discredit the imam is frightening
699007 the same thing can be done with the torah or christian scripture in an effort to cast a shadow on any religious leader i was shocked that a representative of the u s government would use the tactics of hatemongers in an effort to tip the scales of justice islam and the quran are not on trial
699008 our community was not ready for a dialogue with jews
699009 people said how can you trust people who took our homes who took palestine
699010 hurting your reputation and is damaging to the entire jewish nation please refrain from these continued public statements which bring shame on our community and our people
699011 are there those who will look at him and automatically believe that the things being said about him are true absolutely these people may constitute a significant grouping within the jewish community
699012 i however have a personal and professional relationship with this man he has put himself on the line personally and professionally to say that jews and muslims can and should peacefully co exist could i turn my back on him sure i could i would be no better than the christian clergy in nazi germany
699013 i thought were never going to agree so why discuss it but our friendship got to the point where we could disagree and still be fine
699014 i really care about him he is a true friend
699015 in the middle east there are some real boundaries that keep people apart
699016 here in this country the only boundaries that exist are in our minds
699017 for many in my community it was unexpected support they saw
699018 for my knowledge of islam and for showing balance and moderation in islam
699019 id like people to say he was a kind person who loved people
699020 i had some positive experiences and some negative experiences with arabs

699155 when lewis hamilton had a problem with the tyres i knew straight away and i reduced the rpm of the engine to save everything i could for the end of the race
699156 when things looked already finished with only two laps to go and then you just hear something and have a strange feeling in the car as the engine breaks down for sure it is not a great feeling i feel really bad and not happy for what has happened
699157 i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
699158 i think i made a great start and we showed incredible pace afterwards i even managed to open the gap which allowed me to open the gap in front of him some laps shorter than the strategy demanded then we did a perfect job during the first stint and the second stint my engineer was explaining everything on the radio the pit stops were great and everything was perfect and then the end we know
699159 the onus in other words is on them democrats will likely propose a continuing resolution to extend funding for the government through the end of the calendar year without making major changes this bill will certainly include a continuation of the drilling ban speaker nancy pelosi d calif a zealous opponent of offshore drilling since the 1980s has resisted all attempts to change it

699163 life is tough i doubt ill make it out alive lifes lessons learned through laughter
699164 there is nothing in the intellect that was not first in the senses
699165 if this is so if on the one hand it pertains to the nature of the human spirit to be able to exist only as the form of the body and if on the other hand it pertains to the nature of human corporality to be the expression of spirit then it follows that the way of human cognition always requires the combination of corporal instrument and spiritual appropriation of necessity then all human knowledge must have a sensory structure it must have its beginning in experience in the perception of the senses thomas extended this view which was shocking from the point of view of the then reigning augustinian platonic tradition to the knowledge of god as well in fact he had no choice but to do so for if it is correct to say that in man spirit exists only as incarnate then this epistemological theory cannot be limited to a particular realm of thought it is valid for every kind of human knowledge
699166 jesus states explicitly that he parable is the way in which knowledge of the faith is to be realized in this world jn 16 25 in the synoptics too the parable appears as the structure by which access is to be had to the mystery of the kingdom of god mk 4 10 11
699167 in a special way the person constitutes a privileged locus for the encounter with being and hence with metaphysical enquiry
699168 fides et ratio 83 it is only here that we enter into full realism
699169 reality is self transcendence and when man is led to transcend it he not only comprehends god but for the first time also understands reality and enables himself and creation to be what they were meant to be only because creation is parable can it become the word of parable
699170 if you are the son god what a challenge and should we not say the same thing to the church if you claim to be the church of god then start by making sure the world has bread the rest comes later it is hard to answer this challenge precisely because the cry of the hungry penetrates so deeply into the ears and into the soul as well it should jesus answer cannot be understood in light of the temptation story alone the bread motif pervades the entire gospel and has to be looked at in its full breadth
699171 not by bread alone does man live but on every word that comes forth from the mouth of god
699172 the aid offered by the west to developing countries has been purely technically and materially based and not only has left god out of the picture but has driven men away from god and this aid proudly claiming to know better is itself what first turned the third world into what we mean today by that term it has thrust aside indigenous religious ethical and social structures and filled the resulting vacuum with its technocratic mind set the idea was that we could turn stones into bread instead out aid has only given stones in place of bread the issue is the primacy of god the issue is acknowledging that he is a reality that he is the reality without which nothing else can be good history cannot be detached from god and then run smoothly on purely material lines if mans heart is not good then nothing else can turn out good either
699173 flight towards emotionalism towards religious individualism an abandonment of the urgent reality of the great economic social and political problems of latin america and the world and a flight from reality towards a spiritual world
699174 as a first step we can respond to this question with another what is this
699175 the first basic point to affirm then is the following only those who recognize god know reality and are able to respond to it adequately and in a truly human manner the truth of this thesis becomes evident in the face of the collapse of all the systems that marginalize god
699176 yet here a further question immediately arises who knows god
699177 who is nearest to the fathers heart has made him known
699178 oh come to the water all you who are thirst though you have no money come buy corn without money and eat and at no cost wine and milk why spend money on what is not bread your wages on what fails to satisfy listen listen to me and you will have good things to eat and rich food to enjoy pay attention come to me listen and your soul will live
699179 what this means is that the people had rejected gods rest its leisure its worship its peace and its freedom and so they fell into the slavery of activity they brought the earth into the slavery of their activity and thereby enslaved themselves therefore god had to give them the sabbath that they denied themselves in their no to the god given rhythm of freedom and leisure they departed from their likeness to god and so did damage to the earth therefore they had to be snatched from their obstinate attachment to their own work god had to begin afresh to make them his very own and he had to free them from the domination of activity operi dei nihil praeponatur the worship of god his freedom and his rest come first thus and only thus can the human being truly live

699207 there is some concern that conservative states might do their best to ensure that partial experts are elected to the committee because they do not want the cedaw committee to be too progressive particularly regarding issues around culture religion and reproductive and sexual rights

699214 i believe this self representation business is a sham i suspect some big money organization or a wealthy benefactor is providing the finances for this obscene abuse of the legal system and the us constitutions separation of church and state tradition are christians really going to allow some gay activist and a black robed lawyer decide how the bible is written
699215 the intent of the publisher was to design a religious sacred document to reflect an individual opinion or a groups conclusion to cause me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse discrimination episodes of hate and physical violence including murder
699216 this whole lawsuit is making a mockery of the holy bible and a blatant attempt by the homosexual community to away the rights of bible believing christians in the united states past cases against christians and their beliefs has shown that court actions infringing on their beliefs and practices is even easier than taking away candy from a baby
699217 my fear is that christians bishops pastors and church goers will silently accept the decision of a black robed lawyer who may or may not have his own religious agenda too often religious leaders have failed to motivate their churches to take action when their rights are being violated by oppressive anti religious forces inside and outside our government
699218 zondervan doesnt translate the bible or own the copyright for any of the translations instead our company relies on the scholarly judgment of credible translation committees
699219 has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of the plaintiffs claims
699220 this case just may go a lot further than it deserves thanks to a liberal judge who believes his word is sacrosanct
699221 were an international christian communications company with a heart for helping people find and follow jesus christ by inspiring them with relevant biblical and spiritual resources we do this through our best selling award winning and life changing products
699222 if people believe this lawsuit will disappear they are sadly mistaken judge cook is considered an activist judge who has a personal agenda when it comes to so called discrimination cases and the homosexual plaintiff against zondervan and thomas nelson is claiming the bible discriminates against gays and lesbians this case is not going away any time soon
699223 my intention was always to go to the convention to support hillary clinton
699224 i still believe in her i believe in her campaign and i would like to maintain my status as a supporter of hillary clinton

699226 ive never had an experience like this with this campaign or others

699238 given the recent challenges many iowans have faced as result of the rising price of gasoline and food as well as the devastation caused by the tornados and floods we thought this was a great way to provide an inexpensive opportunity for iowans to attend several cyclone football games and have a night out at applebees
699239 its a very affordable price point includes a bonus gift and offers flexibility for fans to choose the games they want to see thats tough to beat
699240 applebees is a tremendous supporter of our athletics department and hosts our cyclone cydlines show coaches radio shows
699241 their participation in this promotion makes it a whole lot more attractive and reinforces a wonderful partnership with our department this is an attractive opportunity for any isu fans that have still been waiting to make their ticket purchases for the fall

699260 mi sono commosso nel vedere quanti italiani sono venuti nei giorni scorsi da me davanti al museo per darmi forza ed esprimere la loro solidariet
699261 da questo punto di vista il popolo italiano un gran popolo
699262 mi sono commosso nel vedere quanti italiani sono venuti nei giorni scorsi da me davanti al museo per darmi forza ed esprimere la loro solidariet
699263 da questo punto di vista il popolo italiano un gran popolo
699264 un gran n mero de gente estaba confinada en una zona peque a
699265 i thought you and your friends would be done with a stodgy political bash by now
699266 im people watching thats all our vice president is a very popular man and he affords all sorts of observational opportunities
699267 if people want to go for flash thats their right but when they write about the real heroes theyre going to start with you
699268 i wouldnt write my heroic obituary just yet though theres plenty of time to ruin things
699269 i was indulging in self pity thank you for the compliment lee it means something to me that you trust me so thoroughly
699270 i think i would but you have to do me a favor first
699271 its not your fault angel damned you all to hell for eternity is it so i can almost see how youd believe you were going to heaven
699272 oh lover certainly you of all people know what sort of reward i deserve
699273 after all ive been a very good girl the bosses go to girl
699274 i think in fact its rather cowardly of your so called superiors to confine you to a cell simply because youre much better than they are
699275 so is this point of this that i burn or freeze or do i just get to watch impotently while you torture someone i cared for
699276 i bet you might even get a turn in the chair when someone ow slower if youre going to work a nerve keep in mind that its less torture for him if i pass out decides to go after vanity and lust
699277 you would not believe how much i took it for lust
699278 naughty stinking female flesh that parted like the red sea for your concupiscence is that the right word you know what i mean we got naked and liked it so that was corruptive and carnal bad wesley you might have to be the woman to atone
699279 anyone you even vaguely wanted to fuck i got kirk cameron for a month because i used to fantasize about him when i was fifteen
699280 youll have to do both sides of the conversation then
699281 but i think they get bored when im voiceless because then theres nothing good to punish me for cant punish a bad woman for her wicked tongue when her tongues flopping on the floor can you and its just not as fun that way
699282 dont worry youll have plenty of time to tough up before you actually see it
699283 and then youll puke again and theyll cut your guts out
699284 you get used to it and the sooner you do the more time you have to think well between sessions where youd sell yourself to the devil six times over and fuck the king of hell and thank him for it if the pain would just stop ow hey shapely stumps please
699285 it staggers her the way he can say something and make her whole world turn upside down split open wounds that are so old that the scar tissue is part of her now
699286 all the air was gone before i could even make an outraged entrance
699287 have you ever tried to breathe in a room smothering you with innuendo that you can never hear
699288 i thought they were there to kill me i wasnt going to go without a fight
699289 i will have to take care of this when we get on the shuttle
699290 i was scared out of my mind and im trying not to cry captain
699291 i had to make a choice i made it i choose democracy and yes i chose you
699292 i cannot believe that if the gods speak through us that we cannot answer their call
699293 how do you know it was the gods speaking to you
699294 all glory to god glory in the highest take my heart and make it yours so that i can know more of love i am the least of your servants and i do all things at your command so that your love and glory may be known forever
699295 and the more i know of love the more i know he loves you even more when youre an arrogant prick
699296 youre in a jail cell lees going to be put on trial and commander adamas in critical condition were no closer to earth than we were and were still fracked
699297 why are you talking to me if you think im a religious lunatic everyone else has seen fit to ignore me
699298 because everyone else look you act like you know something we all dont and there are things going on i dont understand
699299 do you believe in all this gods and destinies and crazy fracking bull
699300 i dont know what to believe you found kobol does that make you an instrument of the gods i have dreams that come true does that mean i should call myself a prophet or is this all some kind of coincidence on the eternal round of life
699301 oh its entirely possible that between my health the stress of my job and post traumatic stress disorder i have completely and totally lost my mind
699302 you think you are a prophet and that this is what the gods want shouldnt you have seen this coming maybe warned the old man about boomer being a fracking cylon
699303 im not denying the possibility of madness or coincidence or drug induced hallucination and i havent forced anyone to listen to my beliefs on the subject you asked me and if you dont like the answer thats not my fault
699304 the one you said was too dangerous to have around what about you what if youre too dangerous what if you make people believe you go off on some crazy quest for a place that doesnt even exist because you think the gods talk to you
699305 that would be embarrassing and non productive and thats not the question in any case
699306 youre even the one calling yourself a prophet dont you think its worth it
699307 what you know could get people killed are you willing to shoulder that burden
699308 everything has gone nuts adamas awake and hes seriously pissed at roslin tigh is going to beat the shit out of you if youre discovered
699309 i couldnt go with them dee i think theyll cause a civil war if theyre not stopped
699310 i think president roslin did the wrong thing when she sent lieutenant thrace to caprica
699311 dee shes not well i dont even think captain adama understands how ill she is she is sick and when she is pushed too far physically she makes insane decisions who knows what the gods will tell her next time theyre forced to go three days without sleep on poor rations with no chamalla
699312 cally killed boomer in front of everyone she just shot her tigh was already crazy that makes roslin less crazy by comparison and lee is with the president i trust lee
699313 were all a little in love with her you know
699314 but apollos got a good head on his shoulders hell be able to handle it
699315 but its different with them captain adama was the only person who ever mattered more to president roslin than the big picture except i maybe mattered not like him but i thought she listened to me a little and i was jealous but i couldnt follow her them down this path maybe ill be wrong i hope im wrong and peace breaks out and she leads us all to earth and it all works out
699316 back at school it was really uh awkward and bad
699317 i meant aiding and abetting mutiny but thats good to know too
699318 i think so anyway i havent been in love before
699319 just tell me you love me and worry if its true later
699320 i dont know what id do if i lost you
699321 i have to betray my president and put you in danger dee is that going to make it all right
699322 do you think the boredom is intentional torture or just a happy accident
699323 or am i the only one about to leap out of my skin here
699324 do you think the boredom is intentional or a happy accident
699325 i am about to jump out of my skin here anyone else
699326 if we had cards id suggest a rousing game of poker
699327 what about you captain apollo where have your thoughts strayed
699328 if i were sitting that way id have the worst knot in my neck and probably my upper back
699329 pushing all those gs isnt easy i guess i miss the other aches
699330 they could never keep shoes on me not since i was little
699331 i always kicked them off the second i could even when i joined the cabinet there was a horrible time when i was at a state function for education and a pair of very expensive and very ugly pumps ended up in a mayors soup
699332 so far this week ive been arrested and thrown in the brig cylons have tried to kill me and blew two holes in my favorite jacket and colonel tigh has declared martial law and i sit and sit and sit
699333 now i suppose i will try to get some sleep on this fantastic little bunk billy when is dualla off i think you should see her as much as possible and im sure you can do a late shift for the corporal later
699334 youre so diplomatic that its starting to make me sick
699335 captain apollo is there a reason youre so angry with me did i do something
699336 or are you now blaming me for what happened to your father as well as lieutenant thrace
699337 and how noble of you to share that blame lee it makes me feel like part of the family
699338 your personal beliefs about whether you are or arent a prophet should not affect your policy
699339 and if that means letting us all die what then
699340 do you think i havent thought about this do you think i enjoy having people stare at me like im going to do a miracle at any moment
699341 my apologies corporal weve put you in a difficult spot
699342 i didnt realize it was only the once and there are much more important things going on havent you ever gotten caught up in the heat of the moment
699343 kat corporal do me a favor tell tigh that the president needs a change of clothes and access to the shower we need to keep her in good condition
699344 sir im not one to question but do you usually get so touchy feely with president roslin
699345 i wouldnt have guessed she had it in her but you are awful pretty sir
699346 if she keeps you alive and on your toes i dont give a frack sir
699347 too many people in that tiny room make me claustrophobic
699348 its not my business sir but if youre trying to pretend that youre not interested in him sir you might try a little harder
699349 which one should i use do you have to guard me is there a time limit
699350 you do good work on this ship and if i must be here im glad to know that im being guarded and protected by the best
699351 thank you for the gift gods be with you all of you
699352 if they knew it was your fault that lieutenant thrace is gone they wouldnt be so nice
699353 i know it the way i know that commander adama will survive
699354 youre good youve even got me thinking that it could be true
699355 i am a prisoner and a very frustrated woman in search of the way to best do what she has to do
699356 of course the heads had more than its fair share of folks in need
699357 dont worry about it were all having those days and it makes you human
699358 though it does make me think that youre not telling the whole truth about whats going on with
699359 this place is a fracking madhouse these days man president looks pretty good in the uniform though whens she gonna see you apollo
699360 remember were both stuck there while tigh is deliberating our fates
699361 she was givin us the eye though we lookin extra hot today or something kat
699362 why would the president who is old enough to be your mom look at you
699363 and all her boys are so pretty she can look in any direction she wants and be happy theres that billy kid dees got and corporals not bad either
699364 shes all older like the old mans age too old to be looking
699365 womens sexual peak is right at her age i bet if she was after you youd be the happiest nugget in the nugget town bet shed lay you out flat hot dog
699366 whether or not shes committed a crime shes still the president
699367 i almost thought you were kara for a second there theyd just have to cut your hair
699368 im sure that colonel tigh will make sure im cared for until i rot away
699369 itll make it easier for zarek to let him keep me out of sight while he takes over what remains of the civilian government
699370 that was unnecessarily bitter of me i dont like being locked in a cage no matter how congenial the company
699371 i keep trying to think of something else but instead my thoughts keep drifting to lifes prurient concerns
699372 like how you can best exploit me for sex and power
699373 but i think billys first in line for the exploitation
699374 i always liked sleeping out under the stars with a stick and some marshmallows to go with
699375 you do realize that i have seniority in this sordid affair so i am the one who is supposed to use lines
699376 keep an eye out for him captain adama and i are discussing the absolutely inappropriate nature of his pick up technique and wed prefer not to be disturbed
699377 remember that im not impressed by your presidency because were in jail and i know of your misdeeds
699378 ever have kinky prison sex with a bad girl in uniform because i can arrange that if you ask me nicely
699379 kinky prison sex with a bad girl in uniform frack laura i dont think kara would have said that
699380 this isnt just a desperate encounter between two stressed and unhappy people in a dark hour
699381 with you in particular i dont know you make everything unclear
699382 i could have met you two months ago and you wouldnt have even been a part of my real life if the cylons hadnt come and i find that profoundly depressing
699383 that it upsets me to think i wouldnt have known you
699384 that i keep thinking that it would have been a shame
699385 is there an army cover up of rape and murder of women soldiers
699386 suicide or murder three years after the death of pfc lavena johnson in iraq her parents continue their call for a congressional investigation
699387 my frakking ride left me in the hills and me and sahyanne need to get back to our transports come on cally dont be a brat youre awake and everything
699388 will be okay i mean the guy were with could drop us off in the morning but dad will pitch a fit and try to kick me out again and come on cally come get me
699389 mollison i dont even know where you are i havent been on aquaria for two years and i havent lived in uranion for like five and it will take me a minute to figure out where you are from out here in the suburbs
699390 i dont even know what to do and i cant find dad
699391 i did it for six months when i didnt have a job
699392 when are you bringing your military friends to uranion all the guys here are so u p and mollison says your friends are cute
699393 im so curious what it will be like in the scroll days
699394 you know what would be cool if the leader were a girl you know she wont be but that would be cool
699395 it wouldnt kill you to pretend you give a frak cally
699396 i think the scriptures arent literal mollison literalism is kind of creepy sometimes
699397 youre not even going to come back to aquaria once you get out are you youll go to like frakking caprica i bet thats what you want to do go to caprica and be all like you dont know where aquaria is
699398 my friends are kind of busy its hard to get leave at the same time
699399 i bet that guy you were talking about crashdown would come he sounds like hed like playing pop top
699400 officers dont just come out to play pop top mollison
699401 well what about that guy you said is like your big brother that chief guy tyrol he should come visit
699402 i wouldnt even date a guy with just a little auto transport
699403 totally different you went to your uni and totally just disappeared like you never even lived here took off and left me behind
699404 i mean come on cally were all just waiting to move out further north with our trailers and pop tops you shouldnt be so mean about us having fun theres my transport i gotta take sahya down to hers in the rancho
699405 im sorry your whole family they were in uranion yeah
699406 northside frakking uranion the tackiest place on the planet and aquarias a pretty tacky planet
699407 they put all the yokels there i mean my sister was named mollison who names a kid mollison
699408 last time i talked to her it was big time drama i had to drive her home because she had gotten stuck at this party and her friends had ditched her and she had this stupid friend sahya and they always wanted to know why i didnt bring galactica people to uranion and it was like come on im going to bring galactica people to drink beer and play pop top with all the other yokels but mollison wasnt so smart she was always joking she was gonna get her a trailer and go up north out to real country she teased a lot said i was stuck up for wanting to leave aquaria
699409 its how i was when i found out sharon was well it just made me think of all the things i wouldnt let myself think about
699410 it wasnt even that i wouldnt let myself think about mollison
699411 it was like it was so easy not thinking about her that it was almost like she wasnt dead until now
699412 youre doing real good no matter what youre doing im proud of you and i know theyd be proud too
699413 laura would have fallen over laughing politely but she would have laughed
699414 she had lost her mind in the end from the pain and the drugs
699415 she spent most of her time raving they dont mention that
699416 i cant stand to be at the wake of the holy prophet roslin when its laura whos dead
699417 i guess i didnt at the time but i almost shit myself having the president tell me i didnt know about women like she was my mom or my aunt or something
699418 she was so mad at me when i told her that she needed to stop using the chamalla and lead the frackin people she told me i was worse than my father almost threw a book at me
699419 i dont know who all these people knew but it wasnt really laura was it
699420 she cried so much begged me to make it stop and i couldnt
699421 and she was lucid at the moment id spent two hours holding her hand and listening to her talk she was calling for someone
699422 fracking gods how could anyone do that to a person why would they kill her why would anyone want to kill her so much she was just trying frack
699423 i dont want to die alone and it comes on me so fast
699424 if you hadnt done it she would have asked me she doesnt change her mind
699425 twenty or thirty minutes before i fall asleep maybe an hour until heart and respiratory function shut down
699426 you know i wish i had said good bye to billy he wont forgive me he shouldnt
699427 its enough that youre here and i know youre here and that i got to see you one last time
699428 captain apollo please dont make this worse by trying to be polite
699429 ill be the dead beloved prophet who gave the people hope and lead them to earth and youll be the hero you were supposed to be the part where i was a dying middle aged woman in love with a man half her age will be forgotten because its not important to the story
699430 i care i love you too frack the story live we can get the doc
699431 you have to let me i cant it hurts so much lee i cant stand it anymore i cant
699432 but i cant stay like this anymore i cant please dont ask me that
699433 every day for every time she begged me to stop the pain she begged you to come back that she was sorry
699434 when she was awake shed ask if shed said anything embarrassing and she knew she had it drove her crazier
699435 and shes done what she wanted hasnt she gods help the man who tries to discredit the holy prophet roslin damn it damn it and damn her for doing this to us
699436 i think i think i might sleep now its been so hard to sleep because of the pain will you keep watch lee
699437 for personal reasons i request all to use my ng name it is a request
699438 i mean there is something but i dont know how to say it im not even sure if youll want to hear it
699439 lee if i only got to hear what i wanted my days would be much freer
699440 i like you a lot i think youre an admirable woman
699441 lee either youre planning to assassinate me or this is the most awkward declaration of love since billy tried to get to know dee and got her involved in a prison riot
699442 lee you of all people realize that everything about what you just said is a bad idea
699443 you are nearly twenty five years younger than i am this is not a discussion captain apollo
699444 i suppose i could attempt to say im not interested in you as a man but rather as my protege
699445 which is much more original than what i thought youd say which is that my father would pitch a fit
699446 that says more about this relationship than youd like to think lee
699447 that your first fear is what your father has to say
699448 youre the president hes the commander of the military preventing conflict between you is a good thing
699449 and also i was expecting the age problem not a question of politics
699450 you tell me how its not a matter of politics and i will let you win the age battle
699451 im not running for office you have the same right to love and happiness as anyone else
699452 stop making this more difficult than it has to be
699453 i know its not going to be easy but it could be simple
699454 you know as well as i do it cant work
699455 ask yourself why you cant bring yourself to say things like love or want or why we keep dancing around using any concrete phrases
699456 we could wait for you to put your shirt on right
699457 but im fine what do you need to discuss lieutenant
699458 i might try to catch a nap wake me if im drooling please
699459 just a touch of a headache i havent been sleeping lately
699460 i know that youre not feeling well and my father should have held off on this meeting until tomorrow
699461 i also know that our own discussion has been interrupted
699462 are you well madam president lieutenant thrace said something about a migraine
699463 id like to see the doctor after our meeting do you mind keeping me overnight on the galactica
699464 im certain that lee here can find acceptable quarters for you after your appointment
699465 now what is zarek up to and how can i help spike his wheels
699466 whatever could be keeping you awake it couldnt be your conscience
699467 its terrible isnt it so much pressure leadership some people handle it better than others like the estimable president roslin
699468 i imagine shes under a great deal of stress too
699469 adama calling her over for a rare conference zareks plotting i wonder how she copes
699470 she probably relaxes with a good book and a cup of tea
699471 but youre paying attention to them the way hes looking at her he could have anyone he could have that questionable blonde youre so interested in kara but this is who he wants isnt that interesting
699472 and be watched wouldnt you like it if someone looked at you the way madam president is looking at her dashing young hero can you see what shes saying to him
699473 god sees everything gaius god sees our hearts what do you think he sees in the gallant young captain and his schoolteacher
699474 honor a certain dreary bourgeois love of custom and principle
699475 look at how innocent they are a simple secret love affair a few stolen kisses and you cant stop watching because you know its real like all children of god you ache for real love and worship it even from afar
699476 when humans finally understand there is no hiding from god these hidden loves will emerge and youll understand that what youve called love is a childs game
699477 that your god rather approves of hiding maybe hes blessed these lovers
699478 the question is will they be able to recognize that blessing when it comes in a form they dont want
699479 am i losing my mind or are you suddenly hot for teacher
699480 i dont interrogate you about your personal life do i
699481 look lee even a political plebe like me can see why this is a bad idea so two players like you and president roslin should know that playing footsie is not an option or are you that hard up for female attention soldier
699482 you think i havent gotten the lecture laura gave me the lecture frack i gave me the lecture its a political nightmare waiting to happen in the hands of someone like tom zarek its a potential conflict of interest my father will probably want someone else to advise laura
699483 your father if i remember correctly possibly wants madam president in that you interest me if i dont have to kill you first for endangering my people because youre a glorified schoolteacher who knows frack nothing way
699484 its all part of the wrongness of the situation adama you dont go around banging politicians especially not politicians who could be your mother or stepmother and hey heres a thought its just a bad idea to get personally involved with the fracking president
699485 no because your father is not a subordinate advisor to the president nor is he over twenty years younger than her
699486 you dont think anyone would make noise over the military and civilian commanders uniting privately
699487 no but youve made it pretty clear that whats got you up in arms
699488 is that shes too old for me you think ive got some kind of oedipal complex and its got you acting like a child
699489 believe youre a poor oppressed child whos being treated mean because you got some cold hard truth from a friend its a bad idea lee youll regret not cooling off and thinking about things instead of letting your dick do the thinking for you
699490 arent you the one who makes decisions from the seat of her pants most of the time
699491 maybe its my turn to be the brash one starbuck
699492 so when do you next get away to the cloud nine mrs tigh
699493 humanitys so busy running they dont seem to have much time to be human
699494 we have to think about finding a new home one safe from extinction
699495 what does safety mean if were conditioned to behave like survivors not people
699496 the cylons are threatening our bodies not our souls were the ones doing that
699497 you should tell her about what we saw last night
699498 i was just saying that i think that you underestimate human ability to be human under stressful circumstances
699499 mostly young people personnel on galactica that kind of thing
699500 thats not very nice to mrs tigh shes trying very hard to get valuable gossip out of you and maybe more
699501 i had a very interesting trip down the corridors last night
699502 go on tell her everything gaius you know you want to have someone to gossip with
699503 how rapidly captain adama has risen in the government one of the presidents top advisors how do you feel about our madam president mrs tigh
699504 im sure that somewhere a kindergarten is missing her desperately
699505 though i will admit she has a lovely collection of teachers pets including lee adama is there a point to our political discussion or is this a fringe benefit of talking to the vice president
699506 i didnt realize we were having a political discussion mrs tigh
699507 that dowdy old woman when he are you certain thats what you saw
699508 im sure it would be wrong of me to speculate on president roslins personal affairs
699509 who would have thought that dashing young lad would get entangled by i suppose power can be very seductive
699510 i wonder if the good mr tigh realizes that his wifes in bed with tom zarek
699511 i didnt even have to help you figure that out
699512 now the one thing i cant figure out is why youre so interested in petty gossip so the president is involved with a younger man so what
699513 and nothing brings talk of liberal attitudes to a screeching halt like the appearance of impropriety humans pretend to be open minded but whenever theyre tested they prove themselves to be narrow minded
699514 it will come to nothing youll see its petty gossip at best
699515 but you have to remember gaius the games already fixed and in gods hands heads i win tails you lose
699516 i love you and i dont want you to get hurt
699517 tell him oh damn it give me a minute and ill talk to him
699518 im glad to hear that all is well in the government
699519 well not exactly but i did want to congratulate you for being so free of duty that you can find the time for a personal life
699520 i cant say that id recommend corridors on the galactica for trysts of course
699521 but i suppose colonial one is crowded perhaps you could arrange a vacation on cloud nine you are the president after all though i suppose you and captain apollo might want some privacy after all the questions
699522 do you have nothing better to do than spread rumor and innuendo
699523 my source says the rumor comes from a highly placed member of the governments personal observation
699524 id prefer not to reveal the source but please dont take the high and mighty route
699525 if you have no business to discuss well talk at the next meeting of the quorum of twelve
699526 im sure by then everyone will have something to say madam president
699527 i just felt it fair to mention it to you in advance fair warning you might say
699528 how does he know nobody else knows lieutenant thrace confronted me but she wouldnt talk to zarek
699529 lee did i mention how much im not in the mood to have my credibility dragged through the mud especially not because you had a falling out with kara
699530 then we provided quite a show for a highly placed member of my government
699531 it would be a highly convenient way for you to hit him a few times for me
699532 even if it was baltar theres no proof he went to zarek it doesnt seem his style
699533 no but it would be his style to gossip ineptly and blurt things out without thinking
699534 especially if he was gossiping with someone who actually enjoys political scandal with a side of sex
699535 which cuts down the list considerably in fact i cant think of anyone which i suppose shows that we need to have better intel on politics around here
699536 i think ill have a talk with our estimable vice president
699537 ask lieutenant thrace if anyone has been probing her for toothsome gossip delicately of course
699538 kara would think i blamed her if i tried to be circumspect or shed think i was up to something
699539 or am i wrong in thinking that youre a highly placed source in my government with inside information
699540 you i what on earth are you talking about madam president
699541 you were on galactica two nights ago you or someone you spoke to told tom zarek that im having an affair with captain lee adama true or false
699542 thats i was discussing the triumph of the human spirit over lunch with mrs tigh but i never said you were zarek
699543 ellen tigh i there are no words first you stood and watched something that was none of your damned business and then you shared all your innuendo with a woman like ellen tigh what was i thinking having you as a vice president
699544 perhaps you should appease her if you want to keep yourself out of jail or the airlock
699545 i happened to wander by in the corridor and thought it would be rude to bring attention to myself my discussion with mrs tigh while it was quite rude was meant to be nothing more than a bit of gossip to appease her shes quite insatiable when it comes to sex and scandal
699546 i think i see an opportunity to redeem yourself mr vice president
699547 of course im covered in embarrassment that this situation came to pass in the first place what do you want me to do
699548 find out how deep in bed ellen tigh is with tom zarek
699549 youll do it or youll serve out your term in the brig report back to me within thirty six hours
699550 mrs tigh was making a big deal about it shes very rude isnt she
699551 we would have been better off if the old man had left her to rot
699552 was she the one who made the joke about staying after school
699553 i hear im the last person except for maybe president roslin to hear it
699554 and i know youre not responsible so share the joke
699555 its not so much a joke as someones impression of the president
699556 i didnt realize it had gotten so far around most people sir think its crass
699557 do they believe that the president and i are having an affair
699558 most people believe that its plausible though the pilots are mostly of the opinion that the creep watching you mistook lieutenant thrace for president roslin
699559 i wouldnt want to have lieutenant starbuck pissed at me captain apollo
699560 i make a quick rendezvous with galactica and then i get my precious twelve hours of freedom sorry if i dont tell you what i plan to do with it word gets around too fast these days
699561 youre correct hotdog galactica and colonial one seem to be very close
699562 everythings fracked you were right about the implications its worse than i could have imagined and no ones even said anything yet
699563 i dont care what people say its better hearing it to my face than facing a hundred curious glances
699564 he says its vital to the security of the state
699565 i told him he was going to jail if he didnt do some actual work for the colonials
699566 you feeling okay because that wasnt something you should say where other people can hear you no matter how true it is
699567 i suppose this is all very hard for you thought you had me all figured out and then all of the sudden youve got a pr disaster on your hands
699568 im just worried that the vice president might not think its funny that youre grinning when hes here to do business
699569 no madam president that is most certainly a healthy grin
699570 do you have more good news for me dr baltar
699571 i mean can you imagine he must be a virgin
699572 that doesnt surprise me hes an adama and a man no offense intended
699573 its his sheer lack of taste first running around with that blonde she male and then falling in love with his mother
699574 why would young apollo fail to see the charms of a desperate alcoholic hanging onto her youth by her fingernails when compared to the polite and deadly madam president and the wildly fascinating starbuck
699575 i could make a comment about your interest in our presidents new lover but it might be rather a mood killer
699576 everyones interested in the president and her new lover you enjoyed watching
699577 i think that perhaps the reason for the lurid interest needs to be questioned
699578 certainly its no crime for two people to fall in love what if their ages were reversed who would bat an eyelash and yet rumor has it that tom zarek has taken quite an interest is he yet another admirer of madam roslin
699579 hes an eye opener isnt he a visionary slightly naive but a visionary
699580 its much easier when theres a scandal in play isnt it
699581 nothings easier to do than play when everyones eyes are somewhere else
699582 does she really think shes playing all three of us to what end
699583 its possible that she was aware that other people would ask you about what happened but at least she confirmed that shes got a connection to zarek or can fake one
699584 oh shes going to be a joy to spar with
699585 i can also think of much more productive uses for your hands than wrecking that handsome face
699586 does this remind you of being fifteen please tell me it does or i will feel absolutely ridiculous
699587 and a teacher or parent walking in on you just when youve managed to convince her that nobody will care if you take off her sweater
699588 i always knew where parents and teachers feared to tread there was the occasional custodian but he could be paid off
699589 i always liked when boys tried to tell me not to be scared and i was busy trying to decide how far i wanted to go while he was chasing his tail so to speak
699590 have you decided how far youre going to go now
699591 were talking to tom zarek about the shocking allegations of president roslins misuse of her position
699592 is it true mr zarek that you have confirmation of this from the president herself
699593 i know that captain adama is very much in love with the president whether or not shes simply using him for her own satisfaction or if shes attempting to seduce a voice for justice and democracy one that has not always followed her party line is not for me to speculate upon
699594 and here i thought you were using me for political gain and late night gossip with your buddies
699595 but if youre looking for a perfect machiavellian match im not your man
699596 when has your father ever been happy to see me captain apollo
699597 if wed done any of that id totally frack my good pants
699598 i dont think you were supposed to be wearing them
699599 could we keep the discussion to a minimum until were in private
699600 by the lords of kobol what were you thinking soldier
699601 is that the extent of your invective commander adama that it is immoral of a woman of my age and position to take a young lover particularly one related to you and that i should be thoroughly ashamed of myself for the trouble ive caused
699602 we on galactica have been tireless in supporting your continued rule and to be repaid by childish behavior is rather galling
699603 if it were billy you wouldnt give a frack or would you prefer id taken up with mrs tigh instead
699604 commander adama now is not the time for being a stickler for protocol
699605 do you really believe zareks latest rhetoric that i am trying to have sex with your son billy baltar and probably you and tigh by now in order to destroy colonial democracy do you really believe that your son is risking so much for nothing more than a physical affair
699606 now i know that we are not friends right now and youre not going to forgive me any time soon for being in love with lee but we have bigger problems
699607 shes the one whos been stirring up the gossip and i have excellent reason to believe that shes working with tom zarek that concerns us both
699608 what next baltar is under cylon mind control and giving away state secrets
699609 that might explain his bizarre habit of talking to himself
699610 we have baltar under control i threatened to send him to jail so hes been gathering information on mrs tigh and mr zarek
699611 are you going to share that information or will i have to wait for a radio broadcast like this illicit affair you two have been carrying on
699612 so far i count the good fortune incident the one on galactica and one on colonial one two if you count the big declarations all in less than a week that square with your tally lee
699613 also im getting sick and tired of the words tawdry and illicit im in love with you i want to do the right thing we can get married right now if youd like and damn the critics
699614 but the problem now is not so much the affair our problem is how to stop tom zarek and his allies from ruining both our names and i think your father is a man who can help
699615 put her in the brig let tigh put a leash on her
699616 i imagine tigh wont be pleased to hear that vice president baltar has discovered mrs tigh has been aiding and abetting zarek or that she wasnt immune to the mans charms
699617 now what else do you want to know ill have to have a press conference by tomorrow at the latest so if were going to catch our rats were going to have to know when and where were baiting the traps before i leave the ship
699618 he wont listen to you and if you deliver news that his wife is involved with zarek let alone baltar it wont be pleasant
699619 is there anything i can do or should i leave the grown ups alone to talk about whats to be done
699620 you should be damned grateful that your head isnt the one to roll
699621 do you know what kind of trouble this is causing
699622 no im too fixated on my new girlfriend to notice
699623 and im tired of hearing about trouble this is between myself and laura it is our affair sir and frankly if i want to worry about it i will
699624 i dont hear madam presidents consent to the use of that word and i will not tolerate insubordination even from you
699625 its kind of you to provide me an out commander
699626 however captain apollo is correct it is our affair and i will not have him treated as anything less than a full participant in this meeting if you cant handle it maybe we should go talk to someone else who is less hostile
699627 so youre a party to this absurdity come hell or high water too madam president
699628 i dont particularly care for my relationship to my fiance to be written off so lightly
699629 the damage is done and we care deeply about each other theres no reason to be anything but above board now especially if we can prevent zarek and mrs tigh from gaining any political advantage from it
699630 as you might imagine the current media circus has me somewhat annoyed
699631 no my son and president roslin have not seen fit to discuss their personal lives with me
699632 most fathers would have something to say to a woman of that age seducing their only child
699633 you mean the way saul will have something to say to vice president baltar
699634 just causing trouble in a desperate bid for attention you seem to have quite a personal grudge against president roslin
699635 and youre terribly fond of the middle aged bitch whos screwing your son
699636 so why are you playing with zarek ellen jealousy power boredom
699637 in fact i think that were done here congratulations on having a new daughter in law bill
699638 i see that roslins better than i ever expected she gets the boy and the military is fiddling to her beat it never ceases to amaze me how foolish men can be for their mommies real or symbolic
699639 youre very close to endangering the whole fleet with this ellen
699640 if you dont cooperate we are under orders to have you removed to colonial one and placed under president roslins jurisdiction otherwise you will agree to a one night detainment
699641 arrest me but i want to make it very clear that this marriage is over the moment you detain me
699642 and all it took was an illegal detainment and my marriage tell her that im impressed at just how ruthless a bitch she really is
699643 laura roslins many flaws as a leader can be overlooked
699644 she is no more responsible than you or i that so many great colonial leaders are gone however if she is leading by example what example is she setting
699645 madam roslins harem of pretty boys who are supposedly running the government
699646 well we have a surprise president roslin herself is on the line from colonial one and im told she is very eager to respond to you and her critics publicly about this
699647 thats all i wanted some fresh air president roslin its an honor
699648 ruth so kind of you to have me on at a moments notice
699649 ive noticed that theres been a great deal of concern in the past days about my personal affairs
699650 naturally im flattered that so many people are curious about what i do in bed
699651 are you willing to disclose the extent of your affair with captain adama madam president
699652 i think the people have a right to know if youve used your position to silence an opponent of your rule
699653 my husband and i would be remiss if we didnt explain the events of the past few days would you mind if he joined us
699654 number one when did you get married and who did the honors
699655 lees father was kind enough to do the honors a very private ceremony he and i couldnt be happier
699656 but mr zarek might have something to say first tom
699657 i married the woman i loved less than a week after telling her i was in love what could be luckier
699658 i came to believe that we had no better example of honor duty and loyalty to humanitys greatest institutions democracy the rule of law community hes a good man my respect for him far predates any kind of romantic feeling and i think vice versa
699659 after all not only is captain adama brave and loyal and a leader hes awfully pretty
699660 i hadnt noticed that ruth thank you for pointing it out my husband is a good looking man did you hear that lee
699661 well i did hear that i might be the poster child for the fleet
699662 good thing too or laura would have never looked twice with all the other excellent men working for her
699663 i suppose now is as good a time as any to announce my marriage to captain adama
699664 but its time to get back to work we still have elections to plan for we have supplies to coordinate et cetera however captain adama and i have just been offered two nights on the cloud nine and i think were entitled you know how to get in touch
699665 no i havent seen much of adama or tigh today
699666 ive never seen president roslin in a better mood funny huh
699667 maybe we should have our own pr scandal seems to make it easier to cut through formalities
699668 ill trade someone im sure someone on this boat wont feel like celebrating the happy couple
699669 but at the moment i could care less what youve done thrace i just wanted to go somewhere without the celebrating over apollos fairy tale romance to that woman
699670 i think shes blackmailing the old man something or maybe lee has some damnfool idea that hes being noble by marrying his middle aged lover setting an example or something
699671 maybe lees setting an example because he wants to be president someday after all hell be lee adamas son and vetted by the first president in all ways who knows
699672 were going to have to pay attention to lees loyalties from now on cant expect a man to serve two masters no matter what he and that woman say
699673 you wouldnt be accusing me of cheating would you sir
699674 no but a smart man makes sure that the decks not stacked
699675 if theres any lesson to be learned from this fracked boondoggle its that lieutenant
699676 hope your mouth isnt writing checks your ass cant cash
699677 thank you ive seen a bed before even if its been a while well let you know if we need anything
699678 we are alone behind a locked door at last madam president shall we commence overthrowing the government
699679 a generation of girls will cry themselves to sleep every night now and you have no idea how much that pleases me
699680 dont you know that im much too young for you
699681 if you say it was spiritual i will divorce you and marry your father
699682 poor noble apollo cursed with a heavy conscience and a loud and controlling wife
699683 or did i mistake those three times someone pounded on the door telling us to quiet down
699684 we let passion win over reason so lets hear it for passion
699685 and we managed to hamstring tom zarek again and maybe keep ellen tigh out of the mix
699686 everything weve accomplished is only temporary you know even if weve saved my own presidency thats only a stopgap measure
699687 whatever happens to me i want you to be happy
699688 this is a very morbid post coital conversation in case you were wondering
699689 i dont want you to let go because you think i should want something else
699690 after all the hoopla youre all mine for as long as we both shall live lee adama
699691 another two hours then its back to saving the world and surviving do you want to take a nap
699692 as tempting as the use of a real bed is
699693 i most certainly dont want to take a nap considering itll be at least a week before we can see each other again
699694 oh i forgot to tell you ive had a full brazilian done
699695 complete fusion in a praxis of two subjectivities that morph into a third it is from this collision that a new author emerges an absent third person invisible and beyond grasp
699696 very different to our previous collaborative work and different to what we expected we would do i think our earlier collaborative paintings rely on a clash of stylistic elements whereas this time we are setting aside the habits of our individual practices to reach an outcome that best responds to the particular setting the resulting work is one that neither of us could have conceived individually

699711 no but my people dont care whether he lives or dies they just want something yours
699712 i assume you were planning to fuck him and slip out later with this item
699713 i say we go with the plan except the sleep will be eternal and we can fuck each other instead of good ol comrade nino

699739 its a rich presentation environment for news based on editors hand selecting good stuff around the web and bringing it into this interactive dynamic experience
699740 first we really arent traditional computer scientists we are not huge geeks we were more interested in building applications that truly made a dent in the lives of everyday people who use the web it sounds naive but if you take a step back the web is truly the most amazing medium weve ever had to tell stories but in the year 2005 compared to what the web could have been it felt broken we had huge opportunities to deliver new ways to communicate but the web was still so flat so based on the past we were basically publishing flat pieces of paper connected by links to more flat pieces of paper really why
699741 they automatically highlight key terms on a page and link to content when readers see it they click the link but instead of getting more information about the thing they clicked on what the reader wants theyre taken to a page with the last 10 new articles that mentioned the clicked phrase computer scientists love that stuff because its obvious its the first thing that comes to your mind if you think in terms of of computation show me stuff related to this search this word against this body of text but what the reader wants is give me relevant information about what i just clicked right now they dont want search results they dont want to be taken away from what theyre reading thats unintuitive so thats exactly what we went after
699742 everyone else in this space does it the automatic way an algorithm finds random phrases it thinks are relevant and an algorithm links those phrases to content it thinks is relevant algorithms dont know how to tell stories this is why news organizations still exist no one else has built a rich experience for viewing multiple pieces of third party media like this without leaving the page its about hand selecting webs of fascinating media that draw the reader into the story not just single items but lots of interesting content all accessible at zero cost

699759 see how all the dots in your life are connected how one decision leads you to another how one twist of fate good or bad brings you to a door that later takes you to another door which aided by several detours long hallways and unforeseen stairwells eventually puts you in the place you are now every choice lays down a trail of bread crumbs so that when you look behind you there appears to be a very clear path that points straight to the place where you now stand but when you look ahead there isnt a bread crumb in sight so you stand there sniffing at the wind looking for directional clues what now

699767 there is a fear in america that immigrants especially mexicans will change america they want to speak spanish whenever they please they want to hang on to their culture instead of leaving it behind the way so many europeans supposedly did at ellis island a taco wagon on the corner raises few eyebrows when its parked at a busy intersection in san antonio or los angeles but if its off the main drag in a small town that kind of thing stirs fears that can blossom into a full panic because even border fences and fortified immigration patrols seem powerless against the surge of immigrants streaming in to take those jobs and opportunity that many more importantly theres a palpable disappointment that despite a wave of anti immigrant sentiment border fences minutemen and calls for legislation the predominantly white america of yesteryear is a thing of the past

699840 jihad on you is a social website based on venting the frustrations we all feel on a daily basis by declaring a holy war against anything and everything that annoys us no matter how petty or insignificant obviously the whole idea is a bit toungue in cheek
699841 were not entirely sure how wise it is to borrow an islamic religious term and a somewhat twisted translation of its true meaning in this post 9 11 world as your sites title it would strike us as a quick way to annoy a significant portion of the worlds population before you even get off the ground
699842 this is a great site because the name is so random offensive that it will go viral in the blogosphere bringing in tons of traffic kudos to the owner
699843 jihad due to their misconception about it something for laugh my goodness plus the word of jihad is really holly related to the muslim s no

699847 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

699851 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
699852 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
699853 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
699854 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
699855 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
699856 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
699857 i used to like dissecting stuff in school peeling back the layers to see whats underneath

699880 it really sets forth with clarity various foreign policy ideals that we have as democrats it incorporates new ideas on education both k through 12 and higher education the platform on energy is very strong as is the connection between a new energy future and a new economic future for the country
699881 i think fairness in the selection of the nominee is always an issue to the democratic party but the process itself is congressional in nature and not part of this platform right now
699882 she has been saying nothing but very good things about senator obama and you know i think it is important that he reaches out to her frankly and to her supporters because she won almost 49 percent of the vote and i think she is important and 18 million people are important
699883 its time we stop just talking about family values and start pursuing policies that truly value families families are increasingly responsible for caring for children and aging relatives and its sic time for the government to meet them halfway
699884 its important that her voice and her overall policies are included and ive seen that over the last few days and its been important to clinton and her followers that you are seeing in this first draft of the platform very specific references to issues she has cared about
699885 we talk nuance word choice all the rest but the goals of a revitalized economy a strong military an emphasis on education and education for the 21st century leading into new types of jobs that we need to have
699886 these are shared values in the party and that is what is coming on to the platform
699887 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
699888 people magazine has scored the u s rights to exclusive photos of brad pitt and angelina jolies newborn twins a representative for the magazine told the associated press on friday
699889 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
699890 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
699891 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
699892 but it comes in a lull in the campaign june and july you know the primary is over it tends to get a little dull usually the negative ads havent appeared yet and so its sort of a perfect time to begin the guessing game
699893 if theres anything is some guys closet some local reporter who has covered this person for eight or 12 or 16 years might know about and might it get out before the candidate has committed to an embarrassing choice
699894 we dont even know if they candidates have really decided some of the names floated now are the candidates being nice to people who have no chance but floating their names helps them with their local constituents
699895 i cant comment on the process that were going through i apologize for being so obtuse
699896 when we start commenting you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
699897 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be
699898 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
699899 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
699900 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
699901 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place

699903 im running for this office because i want to make life better i dont think rep kilpatrick has done a good enough job

699908 you can hear john paul and ringo having a joke and a laugh together they are laughing because they cant get a song right
699909 i really would like twins first so i can knock it right out have them two and then have one more
699910 i can only say that inclusion is a reality in our diocese and will continue to be for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken

699936 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
699937 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
699938 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
699939 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
699940 what is taking place is causing unimaginable harm to the palestinian cause

699944 this trip was planned regardless of my visit to france and regardless of the recent nuclear developments
699945 however because of the strong friendship between syria and iran we were asked in france to play a role in resolving the nuclear issue but without defining that role
699946 we submitted a proposal to the west and they put their ideas to us said iranian president mahmoud ahmedinejad
699947 however we are serious and are ready for talks based on proper principles which could yet produce results

699980 by speaking out i hope we encouraged people to put more effort into keeping northern rock open
699981 the attitude was why should we take this lying down
699982 northern rock had given a lot to the community so people wanted to give something back by showing support
699983 what was interesting was that people in the region became aware of their own power
699984 in previous decades there would have been the supposition that northern rock would have had to close and all the jobs would have to be lost

699994 without backing from northern rock it would have to examine how it can continue they may have to look to a more utilitarian approach with stars
699995 people in the region think nationalisation is a holding position
699996 and nobody really knows where this will go next or indeed if northern rock will survive in the long term
699997 i dont think we are at the end of the beginning because nobody really knows where this will go
699998 when the round of redundancies is completed there will be a remaining workforce of about 4 000 there are currently vacancies in the financial sector in the north east that may be able to take up some of the people who are losing their jobs
