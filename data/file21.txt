210129 the voters have told state leaders to stay away from local funds
210130 borrowing these funds will do nothing more than plunge the state further into debt and worsen the states structural deficit
210131 lawmakers need to solve the budget crisis without relying on further borrowing that would destroy local services
210132 in recent weeks several legislators have assured the people of california that they are not considering using local government revenues to balance the state budget we appreciate their understanding of the danger to the state of doing more borrowing and the important function of cities in providing the services our residents rely on such as police fire transportation and much more
210133 the governor also has been a big supporter of cities and an opponent of borrowing from local governments to solve the state budget crisis he has stated repeatedly that the state budget should be balanced with state funds and the state should not rely on local funds that are needed for critical local services
210134 senate president pro tem perata and assembly speaker bass also have expressed similar sentiments and we commend them for opposing the politically expedient option of borrowing from local governments or transportation funds to fill the states budget gap it is refreshing to hear these outstanding state leaders insist that the state finally face its budget demons rather than shifting responsibility to local governments
210135 places such as nigeria where chronic corruption environmental neglect and the resulting unrest and instability lead to pipeline explosions oil spills and illegal siphoning by the poverty stricken population which leads to more spills and explosions just this week two royal dutch shell pipelines had to be shut down because bombings by local militants were causing leaks into the ground compare the niger delta to the gulf of mexico where deep sea u s oil rigs withstood hurricanes katrina and rita without a single undersea well suffering a significant spill
210136 it is blindingly obvious that biofuels are a devastating force for environmental degradation it has led to the rape of lungs of the world rain forests in indonesia and brazil as huge tracts have been destroyed to make room for palm oil and sugar plantations here in the united states one out of every three ears of corn is stuffed into a gas tank by way of ethanol causing not just food shortages abroad and high prices at home but intensive increases in farming with all of the attendant environmental problems soil erosion insecticide pollution water consumption etc this to prevent drilling on an area in the arctic one sixth the size of dulles airport that leaves undisturbed a refuge one third the size of britain

210206 weve got no real proof but we suspect when people get infected its probably through a cut or abrasion which comes into contact with horse blood or nasal discharge
210207 there is no major risk to human health other than to people in direct close contact with the horses

210217 so if your child is injured intoxicated or arrested by police you will have to wait until the morning
210218 theres nothing for them to do over there no movies no shopping centre its not like schoolies on the gold or sunshine coasts
210219 one prominent private school in particular has not let us come and talk to their students even though it is their students who regularly come to the attention of police
210220 thats another reason for the letter parents need to know what really goes on
210221 we spend all our time retrieving signs that have been knocked over ripped out or slashed
210222 they just meet up in the street somewhere and next minute theres 100 of them i dont know where they get the money from but half of them seem to be driving their parents four wheel drives
210223 ive seen the litter thats been left around the place ive heard the noise of late night parties
210224 i do empathise with the locals they go there for a nice peaceful existence and one wonders if they really do have to put up with a group of kids hell bent on getting intoxicated as possible
210225 there is no doubt its a phenomenon that is rapidly escalating in this country
210226 some gangs just like to go out and bash people its something to do
210227 some kids if they see an easy target they go for it
210228 they have nothing better to do and nothing to lose so they go for it they are trying to make a name for themselves to impress their peers and girls its getting worse we need to do something about it
210229 one bully does a lot of damage to a lot of victims

210233 unemployment rate rises as 51 000 jobs were lost in july
210234 still the decline in the job market has softened since the spring the number of layoffs was less than the 75 000 that economists had expected and the government said that businesses cut fewer jobs in june and may than previously reported
210235 there is a light at the end of the tunnel payroll cuts werent as deep as the 72 000 predicted by economists and job losses for both may and june were much smaller than previously reported
210236 despite losing massive amounts of blood two limbs and being deprived of oxygen for 20 minutes economists suggested the victim had enough limbs and sufficient mental capacity left to work off the hospital bill
210237 is the count of unemployed persons limited to just those people receiving unemployment insurance benefits
210238 nothing in this policy limits the authority of an officer to make written notes

210272 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
210273 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
210274 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
210275 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now

210312 what the governor told us last night is not anything new especially for those of us living in dutchess putnam and westchester counties where we are already paying the highest property taxes in the nation taxation of all forms has skyrocketed because albanys three men in a room have refused to cut their addiction to spending for far too long we know that taxes are driving us out of our homes losing jobs and forcing businesses to close seniors are struggling with the choice of paying for heat or medications or their property tax bill our young residents are fleeing the state as soon as they can for greener pastures this is no surprise to the people of new york state
210313 throughout my first term i have been dedicated to holding the line on spending i voted against both the 2007 and 2008 state budgets because they flat out spent too much i voted against every proposed tax increase unlike many of my colleagues i have held true to my principles and i have kept my word to the people i represent i have been adamant about this sessions lackluster achievements and was the first to call on my colleagues to stay in albany so that we can once and for all address the concerns of our state and set out what we promised to do build a brighter more affordable more secure future for all new yorkers
210314 as i have been i am ready to get back to albany and hope that now that
210315 paterson also took a shot at state lawmakers saying his speech is intended to ensure that they understand the gravity of the states financial condition people sitting in their homes know what the pain is i want to make sure albany does
210316 assembly speaker sheldon silver told the news he thinks paterson is overstating the problem silver wants to take a wait and see approach until october when the second quarter numbers are out hes being very cautious overly cautious he doesnt want a crisis on his hands
210317 should channel his innter pataki he should talk not just about the need for spending cuts in the face of massive deficits but the need for tax cuts too
210318 we all know theres a train coming down the road and its headed straight towards us and we have to address these issues no matter how difficult they are
210319 maximum readiness it is not certain whether this has ever been used but it is reserved for imminent or ongoing attack on us military forces or us territory by a foreign military power
210320 albanys responses to past fiscal crises suggest that governor patersons sounding of the alarm bells on the states finances foreshadows a rise in taxes

210335 new york cannot tax its way out of crisis cuts must be made
210336 one thing has to be made clear in albany taxpayers cannot pick up the tab for this fiscal crisis
210337 as winter approaches and the reality of 4 40 per gallon heating oil sets in too many new yorkers are finding themselves living on the edge for the first time a tax increase now in any form could mean the difference between keeping or losing a home this winter for some of them
210338 the reality is that new york state leaders must cut spending however unpopular that may be
210339 but no one has been willing to even talk about that for years for fear of political reprisals from special interests and other lawmakers so i am suggesting a political truce among legislators during this fiscal crisis in which legislators on both sides of the aisle can discuss making budget cuts based on merit and merit alone without worrying about political attacks for their votes
210340 any legislator in new york who reads a newspaper or stands on line at a supermarket knew during this years budget negotiations that new yorks economy was in deep trouble
210341 but still in the face of that historic economic slowdown when new york tax revenues were plummeting our elected leaders passed a 122 billion budget increasing the size of the budget well over the rate of inflation if that doesnt tell you we have an endemic problem in new york nothing will we need to do something different in albany

210352 the issue of reducing our energy dependence and greenhouse gas emissions is so challenging and so important that we have to follow this judicial pathway
210353 the epa should have been regulating these emissions a long time ago and its just been sitting around
210354 theres only five countries that release more carbon annually than the global shipping fleet
210355 the idea of not regulating the shipping fleet is like not regulating japan
210356 the first step in any regulation is an open comment period

210365 the demand for wind technicians is such that some colleges have been trying to keep companies away from the program because they want everybody to graduate first
210366 in some cases students are being picked up after only a couple of months
210367 youre looking at several hundred jobs in just one year
210368 the natural question was is there anybody doing any training
210369 its a fairly rigorous program and there are some students who dont make it through
210370 the job outlook in the wind industry is virtually unlimited
210371 you never know what you may have to deal with
210372 when you are 300 feet in the air it is not always easy to get a hand from another person
210373 employers are coming to us saying we want to hire 50 people this summer we want to hire 100 people this summer
210374 its definitely a big challenge for the industry right now
210375 typically were a bit more flexible in bringing on a new program
210376 theres perhaps less bureaucracy community colleges are known for responding to current needs in their community or current opportunities in their communities if theres a need out there theyre probably going to be the first to recognize it
210377 were one of the leading states for wind development we ought to have a wind tower technician training program here
210378 these are good paying jobs with a lot of upside potential
210379 it is in our best interest to make sure that when those students leave that program they are as well trained as they can possibly be

210390 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
210391 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
210392 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
210393 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
210394 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
210395 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
210396 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
210397 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
210398 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
210399 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
210400 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
210401 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
210402 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
210403 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
210404 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
210405 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
210406 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
210407 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
210408 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
210409 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
210410 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
210411 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
210412 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
210413 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
210414 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
210415 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
210416 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible

210431 what a president should know but most learn too late
210432 the customer firm will sometimes have health and safety policies in place and will make claims about its health and safety credentials to comply with these policies bidding companies often have to simply tick a box next to such a statement as
210433 any sign firm can win business which is decided on this basis you hire cheap people use cheap materials bullshit where necessary and you go in with a rock bottom price the weight of wording about price and service often leads suppliers to think that safety is an afterthought and isn
210434 there is a clearly expressed legal obligation on the customer company to provide a
210435 if someone has an accident and hires a no win no fee lawyer they will probably sue the party with the deepest pockets and that is usually the customer
210436 this failure places both them and their customers at risk of prosecution and civil proceedings customer companies need to be a lot more vigilant to protect themselves from liability claims and reputational and brand damage arising from accidents resulting in fatalities or serious injury
210437 modern procurement strategies are often devised by commodity buyers not service buyers and this poor technical knowledge base allows unscrupulous contractors a lot of leeway which poses a risk not just to the contractor but to the customer company and its managers

210469 the progress paradox how life gets better while people feel worse

210482 i remember going to san francisco in the early 90s and hearing some djs like marc farina the dance scene here in nyc was very aggressive it was either older softer house music or very aggressive rave music and you went to san francisco and it was much more disco inspired and a bit softer and it reminded me of being out in night clubs in manhattan in the early to mid 80s where you had this genuine underground dance scene that no one outside of lower manhattan had any interest in and so the song disco lies i wanted it slightly to be reminiscent of paradise garage with larry levan or tony humphreys who used to play at this club called zanzibar out in newark so with these cold electronic elements but with a very impassioned diva vocal on top

210514 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
210515 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign

210641 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security

210901 i dont know why they critics say she mallika sherawat is bad you have to leave your brain at home and just enjoy this film
210902 in the case of mallika sherawat if she has acted in a film like myth which is a jackie chan movie and his movies are not about actresses there is hardly anything great about it on top of that mallika sherawat was not playing the lead heroine in that movie so i think a lot is made out of it and lot of publicity is garnered in indian press over it and i dont think they have indian actresses reached that place as we made them out to be
210903 kalo ga jadi aktivis ya jadi penjahat gitu misalnya jadi ketua angkatan atau jadi danlap di setiap acara
210904 the plain fact is that washington is disappointed and has decided not to take him seriously the real washington needed to have a first hand look at the man they were being asked to deal with after general musharraf
210905 lacking the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way
210906 the washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously

210932 through this collaboration we will develop templates and standards for new meter and communications technology that should significantly improve electric service and consumer efficiency
210933 that said we do not intend to create a one size fits all system what works for one utility may not work for another however we expect that cvpss effort will be a learning process for others
210934 out of this collaboration we will develop a program cvps smartpower tm which will improve our metering billing and service in the years ahead
210935 this is a long term strategy that ultimately will lead to more efficient use of energy improved storm restoration outage management and better management and operation of electrical systems all of which would benefit our customers this will be one of the most important technological changes and one of the largest single capital investments estimated at 40 million in cvps history
210936 cvps smartpower tm will be a systematic program to analyze and install the latest in metering technology over several years initially the intent will be to improve meter reading billing service connections and disconnections and existing load management programs by providing two way communication between cvps and our meters
210937 through the collaboration announced today pending approval by the cvps and vermont public service boards we believe it will ultimately grow to improve our service restoration expand our time of day rate programs improve customer communication and knowledge about their energy use and provide real time rates
210938 the technology of the electric system hasnt changed much since 1896 when the electric grid was first created
210939 while the digital age has advanced with faster computers and handheld devices that deliver streaming video to consumers electric customers functionally have the same electric meter on their house as they did 50 years ago our intent is to empower customers by giving them the technology to make informed decisions about their energy use just as consumers are pulling up to the pump and re thinking how much they drive and what car they drive we want ratepayers to see real time the cost of their electric use and maybe turn down the air conditioning today we take a critical step toward that future
210940 while we want to move expeditiously so customers can see the benefits of these new technologies there are critical decisions to be made by the state cvps and any utility that follows suit
210941 imagine the magnitude of millions of electric consumers in southern new england responding to real time prices and what that could mean to market prices
210942 in our case there is a financial case to be made for the investment but the real value is in the service enhancements
210943 that may seem like quite a ways off but this is a dramatic shift in utility operations and planning and as a state its critical that it be done correctly
210944 it will help customers reduce energy use save money and reduce pollution

211041 sono moderatamente soddisfatto dice il presidente sulla carta un buon sorteggio ma attenti a non abbassare la guardia in campo europeo non c mai nulla di certo ed i sorteggi vanno poi verificati sul campo loro hanno uno stadio di 15 000 posti che sar sicuramente pieno e quindi per noi un match non facile in casa loro anche come atmosfera
211042 sono molto contento sorride il direttore generale perch io ed il presidente presenti al sorteggio abbiamo portato fortuna da qui a dire per che un turno facile ce ne vuole lalbania un paese in continua evoluzione calcistica e in casa loro i match non sono mai una passeggiata inoltre hanno dimostrato contro gli sloveni nel turno precedente di essere pericolosi anche in trasferta considerato il successo per 2 1 e una societ che lavora bene con una squadra giovane di buone prospettive sulla carta resta un buon sorteggio ma bisogna sempre giocarsela
211043 il calcio albanese cresciuto molto dice il tecnico azzurro in questi anni e per questo bisogna stare molto attenti certo inutile nascondere che potrebbe essere una squadra alla nostra portata ma non per questo il caso di autorizzare eccessivo ottimismo loro hanno battuto nel turno precedente una squadra slovena e questo indicativo di una buona qualit tecnica il nostro piccolo vantaggio sar quello di poter giocare la seconda gara al san paolo ma per il resto bisogner stare molto concentrati perch le squadre albanesi sono sempre difficili da affrontare
211044 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
211045 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications

211064 this change is important in terms of morality policy and our international reputation the lesson of the past 15 to 20 years is that we havent treated asylum seekers with the humanity that we should have and this is about strong border control management while maintaining our humanity

211079 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
211080 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
211081 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
211082 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
211083 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past

211089 well theyre telling me that this is what i need to do to win because youre way up in the polls
211090 we have a team working with bocog to unblock sites to make it easier for reporters and to remove any concerns that sites are censored
211091 apart from those sites for example which relate to pornography which is common to every country in the world to block and sites which could be considered subversive all other sites should be free to enable all reporters to properly report on the games as they have in previous games
211092 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet

211094 rogge said i want to assure you i have always kept you informed and we have not shifted anywhere on this and wouldnt have without your involvement
211095 i said im very pleased to hear that because i had big doubts this week the situation was very bad
211096 rogge said i want to give you an unequivocal assurance that i have not in any way deviated from our position that we require an uncensored internet
211097 i said if that is the case you had better put out a statement pretty quickly he said im here to tell you that theres no deal
211098 he said he was taken aback as much as anybody in the last few days that sites like the bbc deutsche welle amnesty international and so on were blocked

211108 this is our fifth friday mass the most ever i can almost feel it whatever were asking for in these first friday masses will somehow be answered thats the way that it goes it might not be the exact thing that we want but well be sure that it will be answered
211109 for the 2005 southeast asian games we went to three first friday masses and as a result we won the over all championship
211110 the best performance the of the philippines in the last 40 years

211116 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
211117 im sorry if i came across threatening i didnt mean it like that
211118 but i do think that if mario was here you wouldnt say some of the things you say
211119 you try to upset people and i dont get it
211120 im man enough to say sorry we always just have a joke
211121 giving up the 10 strikes gives us three plus days
211122 i am not going into the reasons because its nobodys business
211123 we believe the end of this complex bankruptcy finally is in sight
211124 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
211125 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
211126 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
211127 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
211128 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
211129 so we took our time before starting our run programme once again the car felt good even though i encountered quite a lot of traffic during both sessions
211130 this afternoon i also got to try the revised aero package for the first time it definitely seemed to make the car better balanced which is very encouraging
211131 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
211132 by the time you get to accelerating and get out toward the curb youre going to be well over 100 mph and that wall comes up pretty tight
211133 but thats something that can always be changed during the race weekend if some guys have a problem with it its better to be safe than sorry
211134 it was always an issue coming onto the straight with the banking
211135 there is no way on this good gods earth that pennsylvania alone can come up with that type of funding
211136 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
211137 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
211138 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
211139 mississaugas recreation opportunities continue to grow to meet the changing needs of residents
211140 the cover of this issue highlights the citys youth plan initiatives currently underway to help understand and meet the needs of this important demographic that represents the future
211141 youre one of those people where i actually dont take it personally ever
211142 good because i generally only say things for a reaction
211143 but when you get a reaction you say youre only messing
211144 but i go in the diary room and say i still like you
211145 shrider grabbed him very forcefully by the arm held him against his will and did not let him get away from her
211146 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less then average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
211147 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
211148 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still constrained there are no clear signs its improving
211149 tough in the sense of the impact on family budgets
211150 but i believe the economic policy settings of the government are strong and we believe we are better positioned than most other economies in the world to see our way through these challenges
211151 the key thing is to have a strong strategy to see this economy through for the long term thats why we have anchored that in a very significant budget surplus thats why we believe that through a continued process of economic reform there is a way through this while helping and assisting working families pensioners and carers
211152 we are now in the ninth month since the election effectively a quarter of the parliamentary term
211153 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
211154 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
211155 is expected to see extended work against the redskins wr marvin harrison also will play some with the no 1 offense
211156 people love fantasy football leagues and everything that comes with it
211157 whether its for the glory of winning bragging rights or whatever other gentlemanly reward is at stake people have been flooding our site looking for the edge that will help them win it as always were happy to oblige

211165 last year i had a possibility to fight for the championship again and it was okay
211166 i knew this year it would not be possible any more but if i was racing for mclaren at this moment maybe i would be in the position i am now without the possibility to win
211167 at least i am happy to be with renault with the full support of the team and knowing everybody is working night and day to give me the best car possible
211168 everyone makes his choices and he was very clear on his philosophy and way to run the team and to compete like that
211169 as a professional im not like that and we chose different ways
211170 its all okay with everybody you just need to make choices he made that choice and i made mine
211171 there is a little bit of that when you do a perfect race but you finish sixth or seventh and there is nothing more you can do
211172 it is not what i have been used to for the last three or four years when i have been on pole and on the podium
211173 but it is part of the job the sport is like that you go up and down every year is a new challenge with new difficulties
211174 now it is difficult we need to recover a little bit of confidence and build a winning team again
211175 we are in that phase but i am not worried i am just 27 years old and i still have many years to come
211176 even michael schumacher the guy with more titles seven spent four years at ferrari not winning
211177 so i need to be patient and i need to work harder than ever now to win again as soon as possible
211178 the goal for the rest of the season is very clear to try to be fourth
211179 now we are sixth but only two points from toyota and one from red bull
211180 the last race in germany when we scored eight points from nelson piquet was a big step for us in terms of confidence and motivation to keep pushing
211181 it didnt change too much within the team but now we are closer to our goal
211182 i have a contract with renault for the long term
211183 but at the end of every season you need to look at what the possibilities are
211184 os bancos n o est o preocupados com a inadimpl ncia porque a economia est crescendo assim como os sal rios como existe confian a no pagamento das d vidas a tend ncia que as institui es aumentem os prazos
211185 os bancos t m mais lucro oferecendo presta es com prazos mais longos e cobrando mais juros
211186 o que acaba contando para o tomador de cr dito o valor da parcela
211187 fiz um empr stimo de r 1 mil em 2006 para pagar outras d vidas parcelei em 12 vezes mas n o consegui pagar
211188 foi um descuido agora quero pagar o que estou devendo para limpar meu nome
211189 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 is an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough so we are conscious of that
211190 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but they are excited
211191 they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are waiting to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
211192 when you lose a couple it puts extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious since the involvement of this group of coaches we have only lost two in a row once in 2004 to the springboks and wallabies
211193 so that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine so it is a very important test
211194 ive got no idea youd have to put that question to him he loves the job and thats part of the territory
211195 you dont enter this industry without anticipating that stuff you go in with your eyes wide open wed much rather be here and feeling that than not
211196 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
211197 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
211198 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
211199 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
211200 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
211201 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
211202 thats a dream of ours but its a matter for football
211203 we want to be available for anyone who wants to come here
211204 it is not our position to provide comment on proposed redevelopments for other venues
211205 by curving that around in those dead pockets you pick up a few hundred extra seats
211206 weve got to get landlord approval but theyve already given us approval on the previous design which wasnt much different to this
211207 we will be taking the signage we hope off the scoreboard but down on the pickets i cant imagine that would change
211208 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
211209 i am not going to say it is drug infested because that is totally unfair but i will say the sport is without a soul
211210 accountability is what the sport has lacked at every level i want to see people win because they have worked hard their whole lives to get to this competition you see their heart instead of seeing people that won because they did whatever they could to win
211211 i am not a genius but i think i know what the deal is
211212 what i really want is for america to send a clean team to the games to me thats what its about i stayed away from it 110 per cent for 10 years and when i came back i saw a sport in total disarray
211213 it doesnt help the image of the sport but i think the sport will welcome the fact that the tests are finding out people who want to cheat
211214 we welcome that it has been very much in the news since the balco inquiry and yes mud sticks the good thing about balco is that investigative processes are now finding people out when the testing didnt
211215 the world anti doping agency is getting more resources and greater support and there is more tests lets hope the cheats will be found out
211216 what we are seeing now leads me to think they can do it i was at a rowing event where they won eight out of 14 medals that is unheard of
211217 in the last three years the chinese have come up very quickly and just about beat the best crew in the world at the world cup
211218 they will be tough and it will be a real battle for all the canoeists against the chinese
211219 they want to show a strong home front they are trying to get a lot of home town support by getting all their people out the front and that is very smart they are very well prepared
211220 it will be very interesting how chinas mens four competes the chinese want the strength of all their coaches here the mens four have never featured in international competition until china got the games
211221 takes a few years to get the skill level to get to the top and the chinese have come up fast faster than the other countries
211222 they have to handle the home pressure and there is a lot
211223 they are a very good side theyre starting to hit their straps after origin i still maintain theyre the benchmark
211224 he deserved to be in the squad were doing what i never thought we would do in playing first grade together it would be nice to take it to the next level
211225 im just a little disappointed we didnt bring our best game here
211226 i know our very best game is going to be very uncomfortable for any opposition were playing against
211227 right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open
211228 but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
211229 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
211230 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard its a tough trip weve got in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
211231 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
211232 it was discussed the centre and winger at half time theres just no defence to it
211233 they are a superbly drilled side and when they get guys like folau one on one on your tryline theyre impossible to tackle
211234 its a very tough ask to come down here and play melbourne especially coming off a loss
211235 but one positive we can take between now and the rest of the year is that well be back to full strength by the last game so weve just got to hang in by the skin of our teeth
211236 they hit him hard but they still couldnt stop him from getting the ball down
211237 hes worth whatever he gets but i dont know if thats the right figure
211238 he certainly deserves to be highly paid just like my friend here as well
211239 in the first half we had 23 sets and completed 22 of them so that was a huge improvement
211240 to put that sort of pressure on the opposition completing like that is a huge bonus for us that takes a bit of petrol out of them towards the end of the game
211241 well give the boys a rest on sunday but then were going to put in some hard work for that one
211242 a loved and missed family member not a brand name like mickey mouse
211243 full confidence that he would happily have approved of the venture
211244 for over 10 years he acted as legal adviser to sir donald bradman
211245 the future happiness of my family is the most important goal that remains in my life no amount of money can justify putting that goal at risk
211246 the nature effect and value of the registration and use as trademarks of sir donalds name and all forms of his signature
211247 in ways of which sir donald and his family did not approve
211248 give the family an effective ongoing voice in the use of your name
211249 i would regard it as the most natural thing for your children and grandchildren to want to preserve their links with you and your name and likeness and i am concerned that if this aspect is not squarely addressed there could in the years to come develop feelings of disappointment which i think would be most regrettable
211250 draw up a suitable agreement that reflects the position of the bradman family and the bradman foundation
211251 power of veto is not included whereas i think it should be
211252 the museum might have been tempted by the fee had i not objected and i would like my successor s to be able to play a similar role after my death
211253 he played there for the highlanders in a super 14 or super 12 game
211254 and he played a lot of rugby at fullback and wing during his development period as a young guy the new zealand under 21s 19s secondary schools
211255 hes got the skills set to play there i talked to him before we finalised the selection about his feeling about playing on the wing because he hadnt played there for a wee while and he was very positive very upbeat about the opportunity
211256 i think hes got the mentality and the composure to do a good job
211257 hes wearing a black jersey so hell be good enough hell front up on the night
211258 ive got to front up as well and do my job first rather than think about anything else
211259 who knows what his instructions have been and who knows how they intend to employ him
211260 they have some plans that will have come out of the last experience well just have to be alert and look for those and hopefully recognise the cues
211261 the guys and the coaches have looked at it and adjusted and we are putting in place some policies which we think will work
211262 richard has come in to that position because he has had some experience in the back three and he is a good kicker and hopefully that will be helpful
211263 theres obviously two of them on the field and the pressure is going to be on double the amount of time
211264 but we are aware of that and hopefully we can keep it under control
211265 the guys are a bit ugly at training and stuff like that that always shows there is a bit of an edge there
211266 there is no question that any deal will be done with regards to didier didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player i think we can squash that one
211267 you do not do evil to those who do evil to you but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness
211268 people think that somehow were weak and not able to express opinions
211269 people think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society
211270 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
211271 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
211272 we have to look at look at how can this happen
211273 it doesnt matter in terms of colour or gender or whatever how does it happen that someone can be so severely attacked on our main street and with absolutely no connection to the people who attacked
211274 im realistic enough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
211275 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power
211276 the cash amount you get may ultimately be very modest but whats really valuable is the ability to have access to that credit monitoring as well as your transunion credit score
211277 i would hope people wouldnt single out this kind of accident and say its because of the program but recognize that theres just an inhernet risk of accident in lots of the things we all do

211398 ungl cklicherweise werden wir es jedoch morgen und am sonntag nicht verwenden im moment k mpfen wir mit der haftung da es eine menge inkonsistenz gibt und die balance noch nicht wirklich gut ist w hrend des tages verbesserten sich die bedingungen deutlich und in den letzten zehn oder 15 minuten der zweiten einheit lief es viel besser lasst uns einmal sehen was wir morgen erreichen k nnen
211399 dies war heute ein ziemlich guter tag das getriebe leistete gute arbeit und wir hatten berhaupt keine probleme

211411 i nstead of controlling prostitution legalisation has led to a disastrous outbreak of increased exploitation of women in the sex trade sex trafficking and other related crimes
211412 this presentation provides a critical analysis of these sexist and racist images that are so harmful to children women and men to our relationships and to the culture at large for many this show is an introduction to a feminist understanding of the pornographic culture and the slides may be hard to look at we have included these harsh images not to shock but to help us understand porn culture so that we can organize against it
211413 i suppose what really ruffles the finches feathers referring to the name of her blog tree of finches is that the pro porn lobby seems to show so much concern for the
211414 and further more when told how much various women involved in porn did not like this we decided we did not care so fuck them being humans and their dignity
211415 i dont think that the porn slideshows are intended primarily to change the minds of porn users though they do if i remember the stop porn culture slideshow rightly its offline present the images with a feminist critique pointing out the aggression and hatred in the images the slideshows are also a way for women amp other activists who dont use porn and have had little exposure to it to get an idea of the reality of porn its all too easy to assume that porn is just images of people having sex
211416 gee you know i do porn and ive not been raped and i find your denial of my agency and consent offensive degrading exploitive and hurtful
211417 please do look at the photographs which are not owned by the people depicted but by the torturers as long as the only people who see these and others like them are the torturers and torture and pornography consumers women haters abusers and traffickers win because ordinary people will not see what pornography is really about

211426 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
211427 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
211428 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
211429 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
211430 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
211431 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
211432 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
211433 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
211434 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
211435 ive had some colorful personalities on my clubs like david wells and jimmy leyritz if you feel somebodys going to help your club youve got to find a way to make it work and thats my job its a challenge but i look forward to it
211436 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them

211485 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women its a shame that so many women still struggle to receive equal pay for equal work
211486 congress sends a clear message today that this injustice must not stand if the bush administration is truly committed to the principle of equal pay for women they should immediately drop their veto threat and support this historic measure
211487 i want to thank my friends chairman miller and congresswoman delauro for all of their work on this issue

211491 if somebody gets hurt it could turn ugly but it worked out in our favor somehow
211492 i lost my head and i felt really bad for kicking my hat and raising all that ruckus out there
211493 i dont like that probably a little bit too much emotions and i got a little nuts out there i feel bad that it stopped the ballgame like that
211494 the umpires did a good job taking control of the situation
211495 i wasnt worried about hats but i saw a couple balls flying on to the field and thought it was a dangerous situation
211496 i walked to the field like six times and all six times i was wrong
211497 bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad i was making the wrong decision every time i went to the field
211498 well see him tomorrow we lost the game because we did not pitch
211499 youre always looking to make the club better and we couldnt do that today
211500 so in that sense yes were disappointed but wed rather make no trade than make a bad trade
211501 you know what i am really tired so if you dont mind how about we call it a night
211502 my god if i have to listen to one more word i will run screaming from the house guilt creeps and sits on our shoulder
211503 i have sinned forgive me and i shall not do it again
211504 so senator you say that the bad things you said about obama were falsehoods
211505 oh dont mind him its just old man mccain reminding folk hes still here
211506 wahai ahli kitab janganlah kamu melampaui batas dalam agamamu dan janganlah kamu mengatakan terhadap allah kecuali yang benar
211507 al masih putera maryam itu hanyalah seorang rasul yang sesungguhnya telah berlalu sebelum nya beberapa rasul dan ibunya seorang yang sangat benar kedua duanya biasa memakan makanan
211508 ya allah janganlah engkau jadikan kuburanku sebagai berhala yang disembah
211509 sesungguh nya istighatsah itu tidak boleh dimintakan kepadaku tetapi istighatsah itu kepada allah
211510 dia adalah rabb yang mengetahui yang ghaib maka dia tidak memperlihatkan kepada seorangpun tentang yang ghaib itu kecuali kepada rasul yang diridhai nya maka sesungguhnya dia mengadakan penjaga penjaga malaikat di muka dan di belakangnya
211511 berhati hatilah kamu terhadap dunia dan berhati hatilah terhadap wanita
211512 aku wanita sebatang kara suamiku pergi sepuluh tahun yang lalu tanpa berita aku telah pergi kepada bapak hakim agar memfasakh pernikahkanku sehingga aku bisa menikah dengan orang lain akan tetapi dia menolak padahal suamiku tidak sedikit pun menafkahiku aku berharap ada seorang laki laki yang bersedia menjadi saksi dia dan teman temannya bahwa suamiku telah mati atau telah mentalakku agar aku bisa menikah atau dia berkata aku suaminya lalu dia mentalakku di depan hakim setelah itu aku bisa menghadapi masa iddah dengan sabar dan setelah itu aku menikah
211513 bagaimana kalau kamu memberiku satu dinar lalu aku akan menghadap bapak hakim bersamamu dan aku katakan kepadanya bahwa aku adalah suamimu dan aku mentalakmu
211514 aku pergi bersama wanita itu kepada bapak hakim wanita itu mengklaim diriku adalah suaminya yang meninggalkannya selama sepuluh tahun dia memohon di hadapan hakim agar aku mentalaknya aku mengiyakan ucapannya
211515 apakah kamu membebaskannya dari kewajiban yang selama ini tidak dia tunaikan
211516 demi allah tidak dia wajib membayar mahar nafkah sepuluh tahun karena itu hakku
211517 kamu harus membayar haknya setelah itu terserah kamu mentalaknya atau tetap bersamanya
211518 sesuatu yang tidak pernah aku duga aku terjebak dalam kebingungan aku tidak berani menceritakan hal sebenarnya takut tidak dipercaya maka hakim menyerahkanku ke kantor polisi akhirnya wanita itu mengambil dariku sepuluh dinar sementara empat keping rubaiyat yang aku ambil darinya aku bayarkan juga dari uangku dan hasil patungan para pembantu hakim dan pegawainya
211519 kerabatnya sepupu sepupunya kami senang kamu telah memperistrinya hanya saja tolong izinkan kami membawanya pulang karena sebagian kerabat kami ada yang menikah
211520 jangan turuti permintaan mereka bersumpahlah untuk mentalakku jika aku keluar rumah dalam jangka sebulan supaya waktu pernikahan itu berlalu itu lebih baik bagiku dan bagimu jika tidak mereka pasti membawaku dan merusak hatiku kepadamu dulu aku marah dan menikah denganmu tanpa musyawarah dengan mereka aku tidak tahu siapa yang menunjukkan mereka kepadamu
211521 bisa jadi wanita itu hanya memanfaatkan saudagar itu untuk menghalalkan dirinya agar dia bisa kembali kepada suaminya yang telah mentalaknya tiga maka hendaknya seseorang berhati hati dari hal seperti ini waspada terhadap akal bulus sebagian orang
211522 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
211523 we need to remember however that the church is still trying to accommodate the theological implications of a sun centered theory of the universe which galileo posed in about 1610 of darwin s theory of evolution from the 1840s of the double helix in the 1950s and of lema tre s big bang theory from the 1920 30s
211524 theres not going to be a one size fits all approach to this population
211525 id like to see gitmo closed and closed quickly but i also want to see it done right
211526 if the government really wanted that to happen they would make it happen
211527 it has made the moving of gitmo detainees less feasible less attractive than it once was
211528 they want a sense of purpose a narrative arc to their lives something that will relieve a chronic loneliness or lift them above the exhausting relentless toll of daily life they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them is listening to them that they are not just destined to travel down a long highway toward nothingness

211534 o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
211535 it wasnt easy for jesus to fulfill the fathers plan for him in fact going to the cross to be crucified for the sins of the world was a bitter cup to drink
211536 god is looking for believers who will say as jesus did
211537 many people think that it takes a lot of money to get started in investing and think small amounts arent worth it

211559 we believe we have the suspect we have been looking for all night
211560 some have been seen feeding on wild plants of the umbellifer family on thrift also known as sea pink and dandelions
211561 so far there have been at least nine four on orkney three on shetland and four on fair isle where there is very little prospect of finding pine cone seeds
211562 this influx could turn out to be very significant 11 may not seem like many but there have only been three higher totals of two barred crossbills in a full year during the past half century ten of these birds have turned up in just six days so there could be a lot more to come
211563 this had been anticipated to some extent as there have been earlier reports of unusual numbers passing through finland sweden and norway the birds that have turned up in the northern isles have presumably crossed the north sea from norway
211564 the birds on the northern isles stand out because of the lack of cover birds reaching mainland britain are liable to disappear quickly into forests and may not be discovered until much later in the year or at all

211583 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
211584 ive enjoyed every minute since linking up with manager steve bruce again and i love the wigan fans
211585 i think most of the big clubs have looked at the two of them and thought these are good players
211586 but it is repeating it they have set the standard now the great players can do it year in and year out which is why they are top players
211587 a lot of clubs will be looking and thinking they had a good season with wigan so well keep monitoring them and see if they can do it next year again then i might have a problem
211588 thats what i said i am a confident player and a lot of people might look at it like oh another cocky attitude but i dont look at it that way i have an opinion i have a right to have one and thats the way i feel i felt ive played against the best over the years and felt right now that im the best player in the world
211589 i think the lakers are a great team but i think they ran into a better team
211590 they lakers beat the best in all the western conference they had the guy who was named mvp and the best record after the arrival of pau gasol but they just ran up against the better team
211591 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
211592 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
211593 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
211594 i think you are misinformed about when you say not one time
211595 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out about
211596 i may not have spoken out the way you would have wanted me to speak out which is fine
211597 we are bitterly disappointed and feel we have no choice but to make a formal complaint to bedfordshire police about the way this case has been handled
211598 the deliberate killing of these birds is one of the worst cases my department has dealt with in the last ten years and our officers worked very hard to make sure those responsible were bought to justice

211600 we welcome that opportunity wildlife crime is of real concern and we need to make sure that such mistakes are avoided in the future

211610 we are working on what the story is going to be for the game right now the logo shown during quakecon didnt have a four or a subtitle we havent made the decision about that yet there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one
211611 theres going to be big guns lots of blood and demons
211612 thats what we see as the core and thats what that game is about
211613 we are still working on the game and what its going to be about
211614 the goal for the game is that it will be the best game of its ilk when its released

211625 sacramento has dropped the first two games of this three game road trip after losing 111 85 at the la clippers seattle has now lost 13 straight games and there are signs that star rookie kevin durant is hitting the proverbial wall considering that this team lacks many scoring options the durant slump is really magnified with home games against cleveland and san antonio to finish off the month the sonics need a victory here big time p j carlesimo is smart enough to not want to run with the kings his best shot at victory is to slow the pace and play tight defense the last meeting between these two resulted in a 104 98 sacramento victory we see a similar outcome here play the under
211626 consumers spare no expense to have the best of the best in their homes from home movie theaters to home gyms
211627 when consumers are forced to leave their homes they tend to demand an even nicer environment from their hotels with a touch of luxury one would normally not find at home
211628 hotels are obviously already capitalizing on this by selling customers the luxurious appointments formerly found exclusively in their hotels

211652 adoption of the p r i s m model by the industry would deliver a common language for retailers manufacturers and media buyers to assess the value of retail as a marketing channel and compare its effectiveness to other media such as tv radio and print it also would give marketers a metric through which to evaluate the store as a vehicle for generating brand awareness and trial putting the store on a level playing field with other forms of mass media

211657 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
211658 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
211659 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
211660 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
211661 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
211662 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
211663 if breeding a new fruit with a specific trait is like finding a needle in a haystack then mas is like having a metal detector
211664 our breeding programme with zespri generates many thousands of seedlings every year
211665 the genus actinidia to which all kiwifruit belong is incredibly diverse and contains many colours shapes flavours and other attributes beyond the two most prominent industry cultivars the green fleshed hayward and yellow fleshed hort16a better known as zespri gold kiwifruit
211666 hortresearch has a collection of 23 species of kiwifruit and many more can be found in china from where kiwifruit originated were now better placed than ever to unlock some of that natural resource and deliver it to consumers
211667 the work involved in identifying these ests plus research that has been done to investigate their use in ongoing breeding programmes proves new zealands world leadership status in kiwifruit science
211668 hortresearch breeds kiwifruit exclusively for zespri and the new zealand kiwifruit industry it is a relationship that has already seen the breeding and highly successful commercialisation of zespri gold kiwifruit and now looks poised to deliver more exciting fruit to the marketplace
211669 this science is a great fit with our natural breeding strategy which is committed to delivering high quality all natural kiwifruit that offer consumers health convenience pleasure and a guarantee of 100 natural goodness
211670 this new molecular insight into kiwifruit coupled with time honored breeding techniques offers the perfect combination of innovation and tradition while ensuring customers that zespri kiwifruit really are natures best

211695 es una grave falta de respeto descalificar el trabajo riguroso que realizan las asociaciones de vecinos y acusar a sus miembros de aceptar sin rechistar lo que dice el ayuntamiento
211696 desde el primer momento ha liderado una campa a de acoso y derribo al proyecto de aparcamiento para residentes sin importarle las ventajas que la obra va a suponer a todo el entorno
211697 disfracen su campa a de recogida de firmas como han estado haciendo en los eventos celebrados durante la semana grande
211698 de turistas y visitantes invit ndoles a firmar contra la destrucci n de un parque
211699 no tienen ninguna raz n para continuar adelante con sus permanentes cr ticas y quejas
211700 si de verdad quieren sumarse a este proyecto abandonen de una vez por todas su actitud destructiva y dejen de plantear inconvenientes interesados y caprichosos a este proyecto que tanta gente necesita
211701 no acierto a entender c mo el se or cabez n ha sido capaz de posicionarse en contra de los intereses de cientos de vecinos que p blicamente han solicitado una plaza en el futuro aparcamiento y les ha dado la espalda s lo quedar bien con el colectivo que se opone a esta actuaci n
211702 se descuelgue con estas declaraciones tan da inas solamente para ara ar un pu ado de votos
211703 carece de todo sentido desde el momento en que se constata que el aparcamiento no estropear el parque sino que por el contrario lo mejorar
211704 es lamentable que un representante de los santanderinos ponga en evidencia la legalidad de las asociaciones de vecinos el trabajo que stas realizan y lo m s importante intente boicotear la soluci n a los problemas de los vecinos a los que representa

211714 though little is known about lincolns rumored italian ancestry maternal lineage fringe genealogists claim to have traced the anana clan clear back to palermo true or not it is said that the mere thought of what could have been haunted our 16th president throughout his adulthood
211715 i guess im just an old mad scientist at bottom give me an underground laboratory half a dozen atom smashers and a beautiful girl in a diaphanous veil waiting to be turned into a chimpanzee and i care not who writes the nations laws

211720 queremos dejar en claro que los regidores del pri no estamos en contra del desarrollo de la v a recreactiva s lo consideramos que es importante reconsiderar la ruta en su tramo de ju rez con el objeto de no seguir afectando a los comerciantes
211721 este no es un tema nuevo estamos analizando algunas alternativas para que se vean lo menos afectados los comerciantes pero al final de cuentas no podemos comparar la parte social con la parte econ mica y de negocios que est en ju rez
211722 we keep in touch with companies all over the world i dare say that in two to three years time we will see something
211723 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
211724 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
211725 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death we ask that the media respect the privacy of his family and allow them to grieve
211726 world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army
211727 it is becoming increasingly hard for americans to find work in this economy
211728 as the construction manufacturing and now retail sectors are reeling from job losses too many workers are being forced to reduce their hours and take part time jobs just to make ends meet
211729 i think were going to see more of the same for at least another quarter and it could be the rest of the year
211730 its good to have the government adding jobs in the short term but thats not an long term solution either
211731 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans not boost the profits of oil companies
211732 its time to restore fairness and balance to our economy and we can start by passing the emergency economic plan that im proposing today
211733 unlike senator obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems
211734 there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses the american people cannot afford economic policies that will take us backward
211735 de repente todo se volvi oscuro y fr o y de repente volvi la luz estoy muy contento vali la pena el viaje
211736 the cuts bring gms total production cuts to just under the 300 000 units company officials had hoped to cut this year gm also is looking at the possibility of idling production at other truck and suv plants later this year to further align its offerings with consumer demand
211737 gm told workers on monday that it would cut a shift at the moraine ohio plant which makes the chevy trailblazer and gmc envoy suvs the move will mean layoffs for about 1 000 production and salaried jobs at the plant now scheduled to be closed by 2010 the shreveport louisiana plant makes the hummer h3 suv and the chevrolet canyon compact pickup and will also lose a shift that move will cut about 760 jobs
211738 toyota representatives said earlier this month that the corporation plans to shut down truck and suv production at its u s plants for three months starting in august and it will start building the prius hybrid in the u s for the first time in 2010
211739 whether he olmert is still the prime minister for two days or two months we will continue to deal with him
211740 if someone else comes we will deal with them as long as they want to deal with us
211741 my opinion and my goal will be to continue to speak to the syrians without preconditions
211742 we believe we have the suspect we have been looking for all night
211743 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
211744 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
211745 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
211746 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
211747 whatever he was doing on top of the pole caused a power outage for a few minutes
211748 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
211749 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
211750 we have dedicated ourselves to reaching resolutions with the families and our commitment to fair settlements still stands
211751 if im going to start an internet business i will learn up everything that goes in my way
211752 hey i dont need to master all this before i start do i all i need was the very basic skills
211753 well few hours course is faster than reading a book lets give it a try after all its free
211754 if you put your heart into doing what you want to do and focus on what you want to achieve nothing can stop you from reaching your goal
211755 this fall shocker volleyball will be as exciting as ever
211756 with the talented new players and our returning starters this season looks to provide wonderful match ups and a particularly competitive home schedule
211757 we are in the top ten nationally in attendance and this season under the great leadership of coach lamb promises to continue that great shocker volleyball tradition
211758 separate and other not having any aims or values in common with other cultures
211759 hostility towards islam used to justify discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society
211760 the message that i thought was delivered to us was that they do not want him associated with muslims or muslim supporters
211761 discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society
211762 i guess green is the hamas color but its also the color of islam thats one way for the obama campaign to alienate 1 4 billion muslims worldwide
211763 muslim lawmaker confronted obama behind closed doors on head scarf gaffe
211764 to empower locals and provide additional tactics to pressure warren buffetts pacificorp to remove the lower four klamath river dams
211765 weve been campaigning hard for five years and still the company refuses to take responsibility for the dams destruction of our fishery and communities
211766 these workshops are meant to get new blood from different walks of life to engage in direct action in our campaign to remove pacificorps klamath dams
211767 they are being held to prepare for the nonviolent direct action camp that will be conducted in orleans from august 22 to 24
211768 to empowering a new generation of young native leaders emerging across the continent who are bringing innovation creativity and inspiration to struggles to keep their homelands from becoming wastelands
211769 we dont want a lack of tactics or tools to slow down our effort to restore the klamath
211770 we have invited ip3 here to add some creativity to our campaign and help us think strategically about how to influence people like warren buffett
211771 as a european american you are the visitor in our country will you not meet with the native people impacted by your fish killing dams
211772 you say you want to address poverty and disease in the third world but you are creating those same third world conditions right here in america we want to meet and resolve the issue in a way that saves you money and saves our culture
211773 disrupting the shareholders meeting of the richest man on earth was very empowering
211774 i think that now its time for tribes fishermen and communities to all join together to let buffett know that as long as there is no business as usual on the klamath there will be no business as usual for berkshire hathaway or pacificorp either
211775 i really enjoyed going to the protest in omaha a lot of eyes were opened by our presence at the shareholders meeting
211776 we dont have a lot of time left the river is already low shallow and warm and every day the blue green algae on the river gets a little worse
211777 when i go to crescent city and other towns along the coast my heart goes out to the fishermen whose boats are tied up at the dock because of the salmon closure we cant wait for 20 years to restore the river we dont have that time
211778 specifically merrill lynch permitted its sales and trading including auction desk managers to unduly influence and pressure the research department in a number of ways first it allowed sales and trading to directly request and advocate for written research to be published endorsing the safety and high quality of nearly all types of ars and recommending investors buy ars
211779 at merrill lynch the managing director in charge of the auction desk frances constable got a research report in the merrill lynch fixed income digest retracted and rewritten
211780 i had not seen this report until now and it may singlehandedly undermine the auction market
211781 suggest he call outside the call he is focusing attention away from your positive message
211782 regroup and conduct sporadic actions on an increasing number of fronts
211783 colombians are for the first time raising the possibility that a guerrilla group once thought invincible could be forced into peace negotiations or even defeated militarily weakened by infiltrators and facing constant combat and aerial bombardment the insurgency is losing members in record numbers
211784 there is an unstated fear that cities all over colombia could be isolated anytime by the guerrilla
211785 around 40 wagons out of the 120 wagon train carrying 110 tonnes of coal
211786 statistics to make colombia appear safer than it is casting doubt on achievements that have made him popular both at home and with the u s government the presidents policy is to maintain the perception that security has improved no matter what the case
211787 colombias internal conflict by robbing families of their livelihoods and leaving them with little option but to join the left wing guerrillas particularly the farc
211788 the farc ep in colombia a revolutionary exception in an age of imperialist expansion
211789 colombias rebels face possibility of implosion chief threat not deaths but desertion
211790 drugs violence and development in colombia a departmental level analysis
211791 almost 4 million colombians displaced by violence between 1985 and 2007
211792 demise of rebel hurts but farc may still be a threat
211793 coping with insurgency the politics of pacification in colombia and venezuela
211794 at pains to portray american actions and motives in the best possible light hes particularly generous in his depiction of what can most charitably be described as americas brutal conduct in the philippines insurrection during the spanish american war
211795 moral and what he characterizes as an imperial duty to act as a global gendarme
211796 it is certainly true that pre emptive wars are not the norm in history
211797 but they are not as rare as president bushs critics suggest the presidents pre emption doctrine and its first application in iraq is firmly rooted in centuries of tradition although england which attacked the spanish armada prussia which invaded saxony and bohemia in 1756 when assailed by france russia and austria and israel in the 1967 war all technically struck the first blow the consensus is that they were smart to do so
211798 although americans are divided on the wisdom of an invasion only 22 percent of us subscribe to the cynical view that its just about oil
211799 nobody would claim that americas global intentions have always been entirely pure
211800 from the barbary war to kosovo has usually had a strain of idealism at which the cynical europeans have scoffed
211801 oil revenues make saddam hussein much more dangerous than your run of the mill dictator because they give him the ability to build not only palaces but also top of the line weapons of mass destruction
211802 in the case of iraq they the europeans just cant seem to accept that we might be acting for say the general safety and security of the world after more than 200 years europe still hasnt figured out what makes america tick
211803 anti war crowds are taking to the streets in london and madrid washington and san francisco but what about ground zero no not new york thats ground zero for terrorism i mean berkeley california ground zero for antiwar sentiment
211804 ever since mario savio and the free speech movement electrified the nation in 1964 this city has been famous for its protests against anything and everything berkeleyites have marched against apartheid the contras sweatshops plans to build on peoples park and cia plots to water down their latt s okay i made that one up
211805 a grungy middle aged man sat behind a folding table with a large sign that said f bush f the war the students hurrying by didnt pay him much heed theyre used to the crazy street people who populate the area some of whom look like they havent bathed since i graduated more than a decade ago the times they are achanging here in berzerkeley
211806 i expected that such hawkish talk would draw hordes of antiwar protesters like deadheads to marijuana brownies
211807 just a decade ago conservative speakers routinely were booed down and sent packing not this time
211808 my feelings were hurt was i too unimportant to draw protests but then i thought back to the first gulf war when as an insignificant columnist for the daily californian i had the campus in an uproar with my articles supporting american military action
211809 i almost miss the old berkeley now as dated as a jefferson airplane lp though it left some tasty relics behind for instance theres alice waterss world class restaurant chez panisse where i ordered dinner off a menu for peace well if consuming 8 75 baked sonoma goat cheese and 18 75 fried quail constitutes a protest against the war then sign me up and dont forget the groovy zinfandel
211810 were not large conventional operations but targeted counterinsurgency programs like phoenix
211811 far more cadres were captured 33 000 or induced to defect under phoenix 22 000 than were killed 26 000
211812 we need better intelligence to identify and neutralize iraqi insurgents as in phoenix
211813 whether occupying forces themselves use torture disappearance or summary execution the usual dirty war tools or subcontract these tasks to iraqis international law flatly prohibits such brutality a wink and a nod from united states troops would be no defense to american criminal liability brutality is a recipe for the resentment on which insurgency thrives that is a lesson from vietnam that mr boot does not mention
211814 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
211815 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
211816 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
211817 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
211818 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
211819 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
211820 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
211821 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
211822 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
211823 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
211824 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
211825 26 gotten less safe with all the guns around i dont think so
211826 my three year old daughter would do back flips around the block for that princess vader mash up bu
211827 very interesting is this a proposed bill or the active one the sense of private property and priva
211828 im not so much worried about security checks at the border taking up my time im a pretty patient
211829 really enjoyed watching the video look forward to many more also one thing would have been prett
211830 das m ssen die parteien selbst entscheiden die verantwortung f r den wahlkampf liegt bei ihnen aber falls sich w hler bei der wahlentscheidung schwertun w re es naheliegend auch das ausma an fairness im wahlkampf und an politischer kultur mit ins kalk l zu ziehen und in der wahlzelle zu belohnen
211831 wir m ssen das europ ische menschenbild ernst nehmen zu diesem z hlt das prinzip der gleichwertigkeit aller menschen und dass alle menschen gleich an rechten und w rde geboren sind manchmal hat man den eindruck als h tte man von diesem prinzip noch nie geh rt oder als sei es auf ein bestimmtes land oder eine bestimmte gruppe in der gesellschaft reduziert
211832 back in 1984 we were pretty much unknown and then ozzy osbourne took us out on the road we opened for him and now its time to give back its full circle now he helped us out we want to do the same thing for another young band
211833 what we liked was that we could give bands all around the country an opportunity not just here in los angeles we dont know where the next band is coming from
211834 its where musicians go this is where they come to hang out buy stuff network
211835 it is unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
211836 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself and excludes any possibility or regularity
211837 as was confirmed by the current statements of mr holbrooke who regrets that there is no death sentence here and it therefore cannot be pronounced on me although that is what he would like
211838 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
211839 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
211840 speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger but not at all in matters of law and justice
211841 after the lynch atmosphere in the media and in public to which former and perhaps future high ranking diplomats of great powers like the usa have contributed so much along with others from president clintons team who are in a hurry to see me dead what regularity can i expect
211842 we should come up with a scenario in a range of two to three years
211843 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
211844 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
211845 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
211846 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
211847 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
211848 do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies
211849 well at least he doesnt have a gordon figure in the wings plotting to undermine him as tony blair did
211850 david miliband fibber or fool 1 is the guardian article a pitch for leadership yes no if no go to question 2 2 did you not think realise how the media would interpret the timing and content of your article yes no if yes return to question 1
211851 if no so as far as david miliband is concerned youre not pitching for leadership and you didnt see this media storm coming as a result of the content and timing of your article
211852 it would seem then that its a good thing you are not bucking for leadership because you are clearly still quite naive
211853 its very engaging a fast read its also very sensual in parts i can see why kids like it
211854 we have not had a midnight release party since harry potter
211855 i picked one up just because i was curious about all the hoopla i read the first one in a week and then with the others i couldnt put them down and i dont have time to read with two kids and a full time job
211856 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective
211857 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
211858 we recommend that every woman get screened at least once and have repeat testing based on her risk factors like multiple sex partners injection drug use or engaging in sex with a new partner
211859 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
211860 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
211861 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
211862 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
211863 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
211864 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
211865 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
211866 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
211867 one of the most comprehensive and complete studies of a random population to indicate what are the health consequences of sleep disordered breathing
211868 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
211869 tv shows which tend to be successful are to do with contemporary life and this is so far removed from life as we know it
211870 physically im nothing like the pictures of henry and therein lies the boldness we needed to do something to get a contemporary audience watching to draw in people in their 20s and 30s
211871 and elizabeth taylor had eight husbands and thats 20th century hollywood not just 16th century england sometimes i think people are just prudish
211872 he was the spare he was prince harry now if you like
211873 his elder brother arthur our william he was supposed to be king but he died henry was 14 nowadays wed never expect someone of that age to deal with that
211874 it might not appeal to an older more critical audience we have to condense everything by about ten years
211875 for example the whole anne boleyn thing happened when henry was into his 30s we set it in his 20s otherwise wed end up with about 50 hours of television that nobody would want to watch
211876 with henry i dont look at any pictures of him
211877 i have to draw on his personality and i had to research deeply into the flaws of the man
211878 i dont play him as a good man i think he was a smart man and a charismatic one but his bad deeds outweigh his good ones
211879 he gave his country a lot of pain with the reformation people had to choose between their head and their hearts his way or the popes way and god help them if they chose the popes way
211880 the simple fact is that henry wanted a younger more beautiful wife who could bear him sons and this is a man who was used to getting everything he wanted
211881 very few people in the world apart from a few dictators know what that feels like these days certainly no one in britain has held that kind of power for centuries
211882 i understand that most companies like their executives to spend time at their various major locations could you tell me how often i might be asked to relocate over five or ten years
211883 that is a good question what are you planning to pay your best candidate
211884 i complete my book title of book this year by date and year i educate myself and do what it takes to complete it
211885 some of this job will be repetitive and mundane are you seriously okay with that
211886 of course all jobs have elements that are repetitive and less interesting than the others but ive always tried to give 100 in every aspect of my work mundane or not
211887 how have you managed to attend this job interview during office hours
211888 i took some of my pre allocated holiday time to attend
211889 regrettably i was out of paid holiday time so i asked my employer for some unpaid leave i dont think it would be fair on them to pay me for time spent attending other job interviews
211890 you know what the job involves which part do you think sounds the least appealing
211891 having read through the job description there isnt anything which really doesnt appeal to me
211892 but every job has some areas which dont appeal so i would still endeavour to take on these less appealing elements in a mature and professional manner
211893 what kind of person do you find it hard to work alongside
211894 ive always thought of myself as very hardworking sincere quick efficient and so i sometimes find it frustrating to work alongside those who lack that particular quality that said i do pride myself on being very easy to get along with and a team player and i have never met someone i cant work alongside
211895 to be honest you seem to be overqualified for this position
211896 you havent been in your current job very long why
211897 i felt i had learned all i could with my current employers and need to move on to enhance my career i am now ready to settle down and devote myself fully to something i can commit to in the long term
211898 youve been in your current job for a very long time why
211899 im only applying to this one simply because it seems ideal for my ambitions and skill set
211900 ive been talking to a few other companies and considering my options
211901 i have been talking to some other companies but in all honesty this job is my preference as the job description seems to match my experience and skillset
211902 it isnt about the salary for me really its the whole job package that interests me
211903 some of this job will be repetitive and mundane are you seriously okay with that

211921 what do you think the biggest challenges we face in the market today
211922 i read in your accounts that you are planning to expand into the south west i have built up a considerable network in that region am very familiar with the political issues and feel that with the new products you announced last week i can make a significant contribution
211923 as we have started to discuss remuneration can i take that as a sign that as long as the package is right your will be making me an offer
211924 some of this job will be repetitive and mundane are you seriously okay with that

211960 right now i know i am in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympic to the us open
211961 you know i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open for the moment its all just a blur its so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard you know

211963 its always easy to lose if you lose the first set in something like this
211964 he only lost two points on serve in the last set so thats terrible for tennis no so that wasnt the best of luck for roger
211965 we have dedicated ourselves to reaching resolutions with the families and our commitment to fair settlements still stands

211982 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
211983 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
211984 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent

212046 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
212047 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
212048 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
212049 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body

212062 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013 but successful business models may differ from what many observers expect
212063 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking start ups to grow their customer base and reach profitability recent evidence the agreements between gypsii and both garmin and samsung similarly loopt has established partnerships with all major us cellular carriers
212064 almost all of our allies from great britain to australia have stopped using the concept of a global war on terror
212065 republican anger over the iraq war and the economy has left some advisers to mr obama hopeful that they can capture pockets of republican votes on election day in states like alaska indiana montana north dakota and virginia advisers also said they had recently begun emphasizing mr obamas ties to republicans as a way to make undecided independent voters more comfortable with him
212066 as we prepare to face off with whomever the democrats select as their nominee that we all follow johns lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues throughout the primary election we saw john mccain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics and this will not change
212067 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
212068 generally when i find candidates relying on that i know theyre going to lose bashing the media is a dead giveaway along with citing harry truman
212069 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
212070 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
212071 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
212072 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
212073 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
212074 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
212075 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
212076 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
212077 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist

212079 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
212080 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
212081 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
212082 todays wall street journal story demonstrates once again that wal mart intimidates its workers
212083 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
212084 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million
212085 it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year
212086 i guess well be spending a lot of time in
212087 its good to have this interaction which supports the family atmosphere of our program
212088 our fans and our supporters are what drive us as players its good to give back to them too
212089 i always look forward to it because you get people excited about helping with the program i saw a lot of people here that i havent seen in a long time its just a way to keep the interest going and its a way to help financially

212094 the person who is really in revolt is the optimist who generally lives and dies in a desperate and suicidal effort to persuade other people how good they are
212095 obama is a borderline socialist he attended an explicitly racist church for 20 years he worked alongside a former domestic terrorist in chicago his iraq policy is mind bogglingly ignorant and his economic policies are almost totally unconnected from the real world of business and monetary policy

212100 if the oncologist focuses on the benefits of palliative chemotherapy in terms of control of symptoms and quality of life but omits information about survival benefit the patient might assume much greater potential to prolong life than is likely to be the case
212101 perhaps most difficult of all is when a patient or their partner or carer makes it clear that they do not want to receive any more bad news talking about life expectancy can seem cruel at this point
212102 but supplying basic information about the survival benefit of treatment need not entail giving intrusive data about prognosis

212120 the people of this district expect stanford hospital to take the high road
212121 i think what were running into is a kind of difficult rubbing between the indaba process which has been in large measure very conversational very relational
212122 seeking to find structures and procedures whereby we can remain in communion with one another
212123 how the two can interface for the well being is a huge challenge at this moment
212124 the frustration that i have and i think other canadians have is that i asked point blank in the second session around the windsor continuation group for canada to be heard in this conference
212125 my understanding of a hearing is obviously different from their understanding of a hearing my understanding is if youre going to have a hearing you sit and listen and you allow a church a province to tell its story what i said in the hearing was will you please accord to the province of canada the same courtesy that was extended to them at the acc meeting in nottingham
212126 we were acceded the opportunity to at least tell our story this is where we are this is how we got here here are the continuing challenges that were trying to address which is fair and reasonable
212127 if were going to call ourselves a family of churches lets have all the members of the family be honest my understanding is that blessings of same sex unions take place in the church of england frequently lets be honest about that how did they arrive at those decisions or are they happening but are described as non official not really recognized by the church what im calling for is honesty
212128 it is important to note that the anglican church of canada has not altered its doctrine of marriage as outlined in our prayer books and canons church laws
212129 i see a generosity of spirit in the canadian church that its difficult to get that voice heard in this conference
212130 that its my observation that in canada theres been a spirit of generosity that underlies our whole approach to the conversation we have synods that have themes like lift every voice we have dialogue processes that are genuinely committed to making sure that all the voices are part of the conversation weve got a primates theological commission
212131 weve got a model for shared episcopal ministry if thats not grounded in generosity i dont know what is
212132 whereby those who are civilly married can come and ask for prayers join prayers of people in eucharist
212133 we made it clear were not at a point where we can or ought to describe that as nuptial blessing but theres generosity at least in saying okay heres a way in which we try to reach out to gays and lesbians
212134 theres a huge amount of goodwill here on the part of people but theres a pile of posturing thats going on at this point
212135 my sense is that in spite of hearings and all that sort of thing it feels to me like people are still talking past one another
212136 really trying hard to listen to hear from whence the other person is coming from
212137 that same kind of respectful listening in the hearing process

212146 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him

212151 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
212152 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
212153 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
212154 we are taking these steps because we want to reinforce the tremendous importance of workouts and reward their use

212158 ive enjoyed every minute since linking up with manager steve bruce again and i love the wigan fans
212159 i think most of the big clubs have looked at the two of them and thought these are good players
212160 but it is repeating it they have set the standard now the great players can do it year in and year out which is why they are top players
212161 a lot of clubs will be looking and thinking they had a good season with wigan so well keep monitoring them and see if they can do it next year again then i might have a problem

212170 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking
212171 in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
212172 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones right to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you

212187 not many people noticed when the crown released the possessed 13 album that andreas actually wrote the lyrics to the song deliverance also 2002 when the crown was without a singer andreas was supposed to fill in for a u s tour featuring kreator and destruction with us but logistics got in the way so we cancelled the tour so hes definitely not a stranger to us

212201 indeed i have consistently opposed calls for legislation or rules to impose network neutrality
212202 like many other policy makers and members of congress i have said such legislation or rules are unnecessary because the commission already has the tools it needs to punish a bad actor
212203 a clearly stated principle of non discrimination would prove the fcc is not having a one night affair with network neutrality

212214 its easy to see what the states are up to theyre worried about test scores and they figure that older kids plus academic kindergarten will produce better ones

212289 support for h r 1127 the american manufacturing competitiveness act amca in any upcoming trade bill passed by congress should be a no brainer for csustl
212290 if csustl wants a real manufacturing and trade policy for all american producers and workers as they claim then support for hr 1127 would do exactly that
212291 with csustl supporters from the steel industry announcing robust profits and earnings this month we are confident that the organization will want all manufacturers in the united states to have a seat at the table in trade remedy cases to ensure that u s trade policy does not hurt other sectors of domestic manufacturing
212292 the u s needs to end zeroing not just to comply with its wto obligations but also because zeroing hurts u s consuming industries
212293 we think that dumping is a measure of all sales by an exporter not just a few therefore zeroing penalizes u s manufacturers because it both imposes excessive taxes on imports and stifles free market competition by keeping out imports that are truly fairly traded zeroing also harms u s exporters because it encourages other countries to retaliate and close their markets to u s goods
212294 its a shame when some organizations go back to the same old playbook they have used for years and impugn the motives of u s manufacturers who dare to differ with the narrow sector of the u s economy that benefits from protectionism disguised as unfair trade remedies we all want u s industry to have remedies for truly unfair trade but they must not be excessive and unfair themselves in the upcoming serious debate on the future of u s trade policy we are confident that the facts and the majority of u s manufacturers are on citacs side well continue to fight for a trade policy that benefits all manufacturers and leave the name calling to others

212330 the biotech product land grab by big pharma which intensified when they started feeling the pain of their own blockbuster products coming off patent and facing the specter of increasing generic competition has reached fever pitch
212331 one or two marquee biotech company acquisitions per year have been part of the biotech scene for at least fifteen years
212332 but it looks like the floodgates have opened and these two potential big takeover deals represents the start of what will be a very busy second half of the year for mergers and acquisitions in biotech land
212333 our analysis 1 has shown that since 2005 over 60 billion has been invested in biotech company acquisitions by the pharma industry taking into account the market cap of each company at the time of its acquisition the acquisitions of genentech and imclone could potentially add a further 106 billion in biotech value for pharma
212334 biotechs elite companies have spent most of july pushing higher benefitting from a series of favorable headlines and merger fever in the air
212335 this translated into the substantial gain of over 16 in the burrill biotech large cap index
212336 is this the harbinger of a biotech rally certainly as the financial markets settle down we will see biotech benefit from increased m amp a activity i would expect the next few months to be good ones for the industry and by the fourth quarter of 2008 we will begin to see a resumption of biotech ipos getting done

212362 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
212363 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
212364 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
212365 having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation

212374 sorry manny not unless you want to sleep in bunk beds
212375 manny was not demanding anything from the red sox contractually
212376 this wasnt about free agency it was about being comfortable and if he stayed in boston he was going to do his best
212377 it was evident the way he moved down the line that his knees were bothering him
212378 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition thursday
212379 once hes reinstated bretts going in and once that happens packerland becomes disneyland although thats not what brett wants for his teammates
212380 he wants them to be successful and do well but thats what happens if this thing doesnt get resolved and he decides to report
212381 hes ready to go report but you have to understand hes been told the job is not open to competition
212382 hes been told if you come up here its not going to be like it was you are going to be holding clipboard youre going to be the backup given those things would he rather decide to just stay at home and be affiliated with a team he loves with his whole heart and soul rather than go play someplace they tell him to go
212383 my intentions have been to play and with green bay
212384 they say no so i still want to play in this division for obvious reasons which i made clear to management if they wont let me play in green bay let me play against you thats where i am
212385 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
212386 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
212387 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
212388 one of the first online investor resources providing in depth information on renewable energy greentech and water sectors
212389 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
212390 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
212391 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
212392 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
212393 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
212394 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
212395 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
212396 i dont know if we were going to move him up or down but well start there
212397 les van a encantar a nuestros lectores que han seguido el crecimiento de la familia jolie pitt

212401 it was scary wild everything went dark and the wind blew
212402 siberia s capital for the first time became a tourist mecca
212403 it was a special experience the colours of the houses completely changed the light went more white than usual
212404 when such rare things happen one gets the impression something supernatural has taken place
212405 protests and chaos on the street are very likely but they will not do any permanent harm to the chinese authorities
212406 neither solar or lunar eclipses nor periodic geomagnetic radiation causing sun spots affect the working of the control systems of strategic missiles
212407 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
212408 we are in a good position to control the match tomorrow
212409 we have to repeat our performance take catches and bowl in the right areas as we did today if we take a couple of early wickets the tail will start
212410 we are happy with our efforts today but it would have been nice to get more runs in the first innings
212411 he mendis is a very good bowler and has got lot of variations bowlers like him are good for the game
212412 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
212413 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
212414 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
212415 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
212416 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
212417 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
212418 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user
212419 were currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers
212420 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
212421 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
212422 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
212423 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
212424 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways
212425 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
212426 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments
212427 little could darwin have known that his origin of the species would one day explain the origin of the tumor
212428 this research report completely changes our understanding of the many gene mutations that cause cancer
212429 it is possible that nano particles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry
212430 seven uncharged gold atoms form a triangle with an additional vertex
212431 uncharged gold atoms probably prefer this structure as it is easier for the electrons to avoid each other
212432 the clusters are rather unstable you cant just buy them as a powder
212433 this means we have to repeat the experiment with around 200 different wavelengths of the infrared laser

212474 understanding that knowledge is power im excited to know as much as possible about myself 23andme empowers its customers including me by providing them with a wealth of new personal information that would have been completely inaccessible just one year ago
212475 i am also very excited about 23andmes prospects for generating novel research results from genome wide association studies the expense of collecting enough data to derive relevant findings from an association study is simply prohibitive for most traditional research groups overcoming that expense by the economy of scale puts 23andme in a unique position to pioneer a more productive and fundamentally new paradigm for genetic research
212476 the group i work with here is like an engineering swat team ive learned much more from them in the past nine months than i would have working independently or with a company that invested less time finding and selecting the best the emphasis placed on security is also unparalleled knowing that the engineers responsible for our core security infrastructure have come straight from top positions in the online finance industry gives me great confidence in the security of my genetic data of course we have plenty of fun here too rock band segway polo movie nights and meals provided

212536 we dont have any middle ground dispute resolution processes in society anymore and courts arent a good way to vindicate these non monetary harms
212537 i decline your challenge on the grounds that dueling is illegal
212538 but these are laws passed by commoners they do not represent the will of gentlemen
212539 yes but if we engage in dueling we are likely to be jailed or hanged if one of us is killed

212549 we wanted to create an open and fun atmosphere in the restaurant
212550 thats why we chose to put the kitchen in the middle of the place and let everyone see their food prepared fresh in front of their eyes we didnt want to lock our passion for food behind closed doors you can see what we do every step of the way
212551 portuguese food is rich in flavour using natural ingredients to really accent the meat and fish we cook on our grille we hope to bring a new type of dining experience to the island
212552 if anyone has been to portugal and wants to try a dish not on our menu let us know
212553 our father was active in the community and our house in lisbon was always a central meeting place for people to come and eat drink and have fun
212554 its very much centred on allowing businesses and visitors to the island a location where they can work and remain connected with their head office
212555 the benefits are that business people can just drop in and use the facilities in a comfortable professional environment perfect for that wasted time between appointments or if you just need to catch up with e mails while youre out and about
212556 we hope they outgrow the centre as a result of their success and go on to other things
212557 we do have a constant turn over of businesses thats the measure of success
212558 it is really important the island develops a reputation for making business as easy as possible and that we promote the kind of facilities business people have come to expect

212607 small businesses are hurting and the sba can help alleviate the strain of the current energy crisis
212608 small businesses account for more than half of our fuel consumption and we should give them the tools to become more energy efficient whether its loans to purchase renewable energy systems or effective telecommuting programs every drop of oil or kilowatt of electricity saved is more money in a companys bottom line
212609 the sba has the opportunity and the responsibility to play a leading role in combating climate change and curbing skyrocketing energy prices

212616 although slavery has existed for thousands of years changes in the worlds economy and societies over the past 50 years have enabled a resurgence of slavery
212617 i think the standards have been tightened and i think that credit card issuers are quicker to change i e increase your rates
212618 generally in normal times if you look at the hierarchy of what gets paid its credit cards that tend to be the last thing if the going gets rough

212620 i think out of your control are any business decisions that they make on a blanket level in regards to the fact that theyre doing poorly as publicly owned companies or anything along those lines those are what we call the market conditions type of repricing
212621 what can you control you can definitely control whether you dont pay late whether your payment gets there on time
212622 the folks who are unfortunately going through these types of experiences with default rates lower credit limits higher interest rates issuers closing accounts down on them suspending helocs these are generally reserved for people who either are on the riskier side of prime or are just flat out nonprime and the lender just doesnt want to do business with them anymore

212771 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
212772 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions

212774 decades of coziness between politicians and fannie and freddie is paying off not only were there campaign contributions but their foundations contributed huge sums to think tanks and many political figures made the transition from government to the gses the list of their connections reads like a combined washington new york phone book and undoubtedly gives the appearance that both wall street and politicians close to fannie and freddie had key seats at the bargaining table over this bill the taxpayer was not adequately represented

212781 the discrimination is expressly based on the degree of religiosity of the institution and the extent to which that religiosity affects its operations
212782 thankfully the court of appeals in this case reversed the absurd ruling of the lower court that permitted the state of colorado to disregard colorado christian university simply because it takes its faith too seriously for the governments liking we should never allow religious schools to be relegated to second class status and because of this ruling this form of overt religious discrimination will no longer happen in the state of colorado
212783 exclusion of colorado christian university from state financial assistance for its students solely on the basis of the schools affirmation of christian faith constitutes blatantly unconstitutional religious discrimination
212784 f rom its beginning this nations conception of religious liberty included at a minimum equal treatment of all religious faiths without discrimination or preference

212788 we are very happy that the pennsylvania supreme court has ruled in our favor to stop the governor and a group of corrupt politicians from sneaking a hate crimes bill through the pennsylvania legislature preaching to homosexuals about the sin of sodomy should not be made a thought crime in pennsylvania or any other state
212789 no law shall be passed except by bill and no bill shall be so altered or amended on its passage through either house as to change its original purpose
212790 having been arrested jailed and charged with a hate crime for preaching the gospel i am elated that the pennsylvania supreme court upheld the lower courts ruling in striking down pennsylvanias expanded hate crimes law the methods used by the pennsylvania legislature in passing the hate crimes bill were extremely devious and yet another chilling example as to how far politicians are willing to go to silence christian speech that they would violate our own state constitution to do it in a nation that is becoming increasingly hostile toward biblical christianity we remain vigilant as the pennsylvania legislature will most likely attempt to pass another hate crimes bill and are continuing to educate the american people on the significant dangers of such laws
212791 for example the typical hairstyle of an ancient egyptian woman which was divided into three long equal parts that flowed on the two sides and the back were symbolic of the trio of isis osiris and horus the style also implied the sincere wish that the gods would preserve the hair and bless it

212828 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
212829 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
212830 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
212831 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
212832 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
212833 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
212834 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
212835 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
212836 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
212837 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
212838 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
212839 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
212840 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths

212845 progress has been made in the last 17 years in decreasing kids risk for hiv and std related infections
212846 however despite the positive changes many students still engage in hiv and std related risk behaviors
212847 for example black students still have the highest prevalence of sexual experience with multiple sex partners and current sexual activity than any of the other subgroups
212848 among hispanic students we didnt see any changes since 1991 in sexual experience multiple partners or current sexual activity
212849 we really need to focus our efforts on these groups in particular but not to the exclusion of everyone else
212850 its an animal study and its a relatively small sample
212851 its very interesting but putting genetic type research like this into context is quite difficult at the early stage it can offer up great potential but when you then go to humans and when you then go to trained humans the potential may not be there
212852 these are very complex molecular signals and the authors have very nicely shown that there is one molecule laminins 511 that is a very important signal to tell the hair molecule to move through the process its part of a basic biological understanding
212853 mice are not just little men and women they are different than us and also different in their hair
212854 so laminin 511 is an early epithelial message to the dermis to say lets start producing hair
212855 hair is formed as a result of cooperation and communication between the two layers
212856 we knew that the two layers of the skin are important in hair formation and we knew that there was some early epithelial signal hypothesized a long time ago but no one knew what it was until now
212857 the hair follicles are still there but they get stuck in the cycle so its not well understood why theyre stuck and how do you get them unstuck
212858 the hope of course is that you can apply this to humans but there are some cautions in all that biology is very complex there are a lot of checks and balances you dont want hair follicles and cells in hair follicles to be growing too much or not enough the on and off signals that are dampening that and controlling that are very very complex and not well understood this is far far from humans

212865 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
212866 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
212867 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government
212868 issues such as operational coordination and the management of foreign liaison relationships can indeed be complex but in our profession the guiding standard is one of common sense the best solutions are those that get the job done most effectively

212874 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
212875 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
212876 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
212877 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
212878 i truly feel we are in for a long haul when it comes to this recession there is still alot of truth telling that needs to come to the market and the consumer will bear the results
212879 until housing regains its footing the economy is a house on sinking sand
212880 this isnt like your dads recession this is a whole new ballgame the mbas have outsourced so many jobs that there is nothing left to manufacture to turn this economy around
212881 basically this country needs to make stuff look at all the emerging and solid economies around the world show me one that is strictly an importer and doesnt manufacture stuff
212882 the economy is tanking everywhere i look nobody i know is spending like they used to which is a good thing and there is only one question left is this the great recession or the great depression
212883 it all depends upon consumer spending we wont recover from this for a least several years so dont hold your breath and try to call a bottom the bottom is a long way off and nobody knows how far down it will go yet
212884 consumers have pulled back but what i hear about most is a lifestyle change i believe we are in for 10 years of relatively flat growth not the end of the world just a sea change in how people will live and what is really important
212885 many of the hard times today are the fault of the people who swipe their home atm to buy another new suv or a house beyond their means it is certainly a tough lesson to learn but it has to happen
212886 people who lived beyond their means now cant pay back that debt due to ballooning costs turns out they should have saved money while they could
212887 many of us are doing the right thing and are still in a pickle because of circumstances beyond our control
212888 look companies are making record profits 98 of homes are being paid for on time and my last trip to home depot i was fighting the crowds somebody out there is spending this
212889 the economic slump comprises industries that are slumping airlines autos homebuilding mortgages real estate etc and industries that are expanding agriculture energy health care mining technology etc the gains outnumber the losses so we get slow growth but the growth is slower than the rate of productivity gains so jobs are slowly shed
212890 this slump will eventually end and growth will return then some day well have another slump it goes on and on and on and on

212909 thirty three percent of acute aortic dissection patients die within the first 24 hours if they remain untreated because the disease is not diagnosed
212910 we did our study primarily to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying acute aortic dissection
212911 the study was also aimed at the future development of a clinical test for monitoring patients with a high risk of acute aortic dissection most acute aortic dissection patients do not have a known connective tissue disorder the identification of the four genes could be a starting point to develop a diagnostic tool
212912 any genomic advance that may be able to identify those patients with a heightened risk for acute aortic dissection represents a significant positive step forward
212913 should those patients predisposed to aortic dissection be reliably identified this would permit heightened attention to lifestyle modification blood pressure control and the preemptive administration of certain medications such as beta blockers
212914 additionally in those patients identified as high risk this would undoubtedly involve focused efforts at aortic imaging
212915 what does that mean if its not a suggesiton that his race is going to be used against him

212917 state department officials have attended and spoken at many conferences sponsored and held by islamist organizations this aspect of state department outreach can be seen as part of the legacy of karen hughes when ms hughes was appointed as under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
212918 we feel badly about this but believe that for this to be the best experience for all parties and to ensure appropriate consistency and continuity of the process it would be best to postpone the meeting until the new commissioner is named

212943 if someone believes they can stop the implementation of the law by eliminating me they are seriously deluding themselves because i am not the system the system will continue to function and no one will receive amnesty for their crimes by eliminating one or two government officials

212947 traditionally ca 70 80 pct of loans in estonia are based on eur so devaluating would make the situation worse devaluation would mean that in order to repay the loan youd need more eek than before it would in essence bankrupt estonian economy
212948 no one is interested in devaluation right now everyone would loose from it in a situation where loans were based on eek devaluation would help to ease the loan burden
212949 hierarchical temporal memory system htm patterned after the human neocortex
212950 our biggest concern is that the inquests will now be postponed and also the isc report it is much worse for the bereaved because they need to have an inquest they need to know and its still hanging over them and because it is still hanging over them it is still hanging over us the survivors because we are all in this together
212951 the victims the bereaved and the public are entitled to know the full facts behind the worst terrorist atrocity on the uk mainland
212952 they are entitled to know whether or not the july 7 2005 bombings could have been prevented and they are entitled to know whether lessons have been learned

212956 hey essic yall need to meet this gal she lives at the end of the block here and shes every bit a homosexual as yall so yall oughta be real good friends

212958 we will withdraw the fact is is whether we withdraw in victory or whether we withdraw in defeat and again you and i have different versions we have succeeded the sadr city is safe mosul is safe basra is safe the people of iraq and ive been there are now leading normal lives
212959 hold on give the surge a chance we shouldnt discuss anything at all until weve given the surge time to succeed
212960 you guys are so quick to call people sarcastic names and insults
212961 hey captain crusty you are a straight up dick head

212968 if mrs clinton gets the democratic nomination there is some chance nobody knows how big that well get universal health care in the next administration if mr obama gets the nomination it just wont happen
212969 our new economic bill of rights should mean health security for all regardless of residence station or race everywhere in the united states
212970 we should resolve now that the health of this nation is a national concern that financial barriers in the way of attaining health shall be removed that the health of all its citizens deserves the help of all the nation
212971 paul merklinger preyed on the goodwill of investors by telling them that they were making an investment that would be good for the environment unfortunately as alleged in our complaint the only environment mr merklinger was improving was his own when he used investor funds to buy luxury automobiles purchase posh offices and decorate his home
212972 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
212973 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
212974 all of this points away from the direction of higher prices clearly elements other than supply and demand fundamentals are at play
212975 clearly 3 percent lower gasoline demand is going to have an effect on downstream numbers at least until we see a real meaningful correction in the feedstock costs
212976 the commodity price just overwhelms any weakness in any other areas
212977 must be freed at once it is unacceptable that us troops arrest a journalist and hold him on security grounds
212978 he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
212979 overall the june quarterly operating results were an improvement over the previous quarter but remained well below acceptable levels
212980 however the unprecedented increase in fossil fuel prices is negatively impacting the companys cost reduction efforts
212981 i do believe we are making good progress in the first half in a pretty tough environment which is generally out there for the industry
212982 we have been focusing on driving operational and financial performance as we began our turnaround a couple of years ago in almost every measure weve shown improvement
212983 of course in this environment we are increasing cost controls across the board and youll see some of those results already in the q2 financials
212984 and of course well look forward to continue this increased focus on cost while driving the strategic initiatives of the business
212985 not as impressive as it may appear at first glance
212986 revenue upside was aided by the recognition of 314 million of previously deferred higher margin business
212987 we believe higher profitability at the lg nortel joint venture and deferred revenues likely aided operating margins too gross margin of 43 per cent plus was impressive but it was tough to isolate organic performance
212988 primarily from customer mix due to the recognition of higher margin deferred revenues and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by the negative impacts of price erosion and product mix
212989 as one would expect based on market trends we saw declines year on year in our cdma business
212990 looking forward there is the potential of further reduced capex spending by key north american cdma customers which causes us to take a more cautious view
212991 faces a challenging business environment with increasing risk due to general macroeconomic weakness continuing competitive pressures and potential of further reduced capex spending by key north american cdma customers
212992 we are moving now from the transformation stage to a growth stage we know its not going to be easy but this is the logical next step

213009 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and its always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country

213021 i committed to lift an executive prohibition on this exploration if congress did so tailoring my executive action to match what congress passed its been almost a month since i urged congress to act and theyve done nothing

213071 shes a severe diabetic her eyesight is failing and she barely gets around with a cane shes also becoming increasingly forgetful
213072 obviously its not a money problem and oprah would love to have her mother live with her full time in chicago but vernita insists on living on her own and oprah is starting to freak out

213074 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
213075 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
213076 we do see stars in our galaxy that have very different properties than our sun and its possible these are second generation stars
213077 abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe
213078 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point toward our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
213079 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star

213116 i slapped her in the face with an open hand four five or six times i totally lost control i hit her all over i dont know why
213117 i only punched her on friday with a closed fist and i only hit her five times in the face

213157 based on the survey results i see little change going forward for the region with excessive inflationary pressures and slight job losses and an economy that continues to grow at an anemic pace without strong farm income and healthy exports the regional economy would already be dipping into recessionary territory
213158 as in previous months job expansions linked to exports healthy farm income and biofuels production were more than offset by the negative impact of higher energy and commodity prices
213159 for the second quarter job losses for the region as a whole have been less than 0 5 percent annualized i expect the region to continue to lose jobs at this pace for the next three to six months
213160 higher energy and commodity prices combined with the flood of bad news stemming from the national mortgage banking sector have clearly undermined supply managers economic outlook six months down the road
213161 the cheap dollar which makes u s goods less expensive abroad pushed the new export orders index to 55 4

213241 this proposal calls for the plant to achieve 20 percent of its energy needs by burning biomass such as switch grass waste wood and leftover cornstalks rather than depend solely on coal
213242 these biomass products can be harvested locally in southwestern therefore this exciting new project provides an opportunity for farmers to add another source of revenue with the establishment of a sustainable renewable biomass market
213243 we are pleased that alliant energy remains committed to working with area farmers and foresters to develop this new biomass market
213244 the project will jumpstart biomass development in and will provide a template for other utilities to follow
213245 both local economies and the environmental will benefit by providing new markets for cover crops that can be grown on marginal lands

213257 this year we raised meal prices to cover our costs
213258 bread went up fruits and vegetables went up flour went up
213259 milk prices really jumped a lot like 9 cents a carton
213260 were definitely watching what we order and choosing vendors that are priced better
213261 we havent raised our price in the three years ive been here
213262 i understand from parents point of view they might be frustrated at the cost going up but the cost of lunch here is really not that bad considering what it costs to go out to eat

213266 the economic challenges that face america have not had a negative impact on luw he has been able to cash in on his incredible abundance of frequent flyer miles and travel to interesting locations both foreign and domestic as in years past luw does a great job of capturing his experiences with his camera and is willing to share with all of us

213273 by promoting natural family planning and female education we have curbed population growth to 2 04 percent during our administration down from 2 36 percent in the 1990s when artificial birth control was pushed our campaign spreads awareness of responsible parenthood regarding birth spacing long years pushing contraception made it synonymous to family planning therefore informed choice should mean letting more couples who are mostly catholic know about natural family planning
213274 if there is discipline in marital bed there is discipline in the streets there is discipline in schools there is discipline in government said the archbishop
213275 when a filipino husband comes home frustrated tired drunk in bed with his wife she hasnt got a chance to check her calendar if it is a bad day
213276 the population policy of this government is clearly flawed because of the undue subservience of president gloria to catholic bishops
213277 basically arguing that resorting to artificial means of family planning as opposed to natural methods is abortion is completely wrong
213278 we should respect all of them because what were trying to protect is the quality of life of the filipino family and it has to be moderated in terms of numbers
213279 since you have a growing number of people to take care of shouldnt it be logical and reasonable to include that factor in our national planning

213281 one doesnt have to be an economist to tally how much more food water shelter medicine and other resources will be needed for their support

213283 the problem of population growth is the problem of poverty
213284 dont blame population growth for poverty the problem is disparities in the income levels
213285 why not address the issue of how many calories of food are wasted by the rich how much energy is wasted by the rich world
213286 they the rich are becoming greedier and greedier and dont want to change lifestyles the debate therefore is more an issue of morality disparity and inequity the debate should focus on asset reform how much is too much and not manipulating population the priest argued

213383 hemos mantenido y seguimos manteniendo las conversaciones con nuestros aliados de siempre desde el a o 1998 con los cuales en principio no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros
213384 ellos nos han acompa ado a lo largo de todo este proceso iniciado en 1998 antes del triunfo electoral y desde mucho antes nos han acompa ado
213385 pol ticamente no tenemos diferencias lo que pasa es que en la coyuntura electoral considerando que los comicios son un instrumento una instituci n de la democracia liberal y como es la democracia liberal que centra su acci n en la competencia en este sentido las elecciones tienen un efecto normalmente divisor en las sociedades y ese efecto divisor polarizador genera problemas incluso en grupos que son bastante cohesionados tanto desde la perspectiva afectiva como desde la perspectiva pol tica
213386 de manera que en este proceso electoral como ha ocurrido en los anteriores siempre ha habido tensiones entre el movimiento que hoy est organizado en el psuv porque la mayor parte de los cuadros que pertenecieron a esos partidos y muy buena parte de la militancia ahora forman parte del psuv
213387 por esto se ha generado alg n distanciamiento como en otras oportunidades derivadas del deseo de mantener espacios pol ticos en una situaci n donde posiblemente se ha perdido la expectativa de lo que est ocurriendo a nivel mundial en relaci n con la democracia liberal
213388 las instituciones de esa democracia liberal est n en franco decaimiento y por ello es que ha ocurrido la emergencia de muchos l deres que personalmente conocen y tienen una relaci n directa con el pueblo

213694 this years budget deficit will actually be 307 billion worse than the politicians are saying this fraud on the american people is a conspiracy of
213695 the white house has issued figures indicating that president bush and his enablers in congress will leave his successor with a budget deficit of 482 billion for fiscal year 2009 which is a record hows that for a legacy
213696 as shocking as this deficit figure is thats still not the true scope of our budget woes because it excludes 80 billion in war costs and 227 billion borrowed from the social security trust fund
213697 under accounting trickery that would probably land the top officers of a publicly traded company in jail the money borrowed from the social security trust fund and spent on anything and everything except social security payments is not counted towards the budget deficit although it is part of our 9
213698 its way past time for washington politicians to have their own sarbanes oxley
213699 but this is how corrupt washington has become besides the dangerous practice of massive deficit spending which will saddle our children and grandchildren with trillions of dollars of debt the bush white house and congress are conspiring to conceal the true nature and scope of the problem
213700 this years budget deficit will actually be 307 billion worse than the politicians are saying this fraud on the american people is a conspiracy of silence by both major political parties
213701 in stunning hypocrisy the white house blamed the record budget deficit on the slowing economy and the 150 billion stimulus package passed earlier this year

213717 by thrusting this woman into the foreground the narrator has set the stage for the following episodes if a woman is the key to samsons birth women will also be the key to his death
213718 the completion of the agenda will await another day and another man
213719 in israel children were a mark of the blessing of god and barrenness was the sign of divine reproach displeasure his curse
213720 indicates that the oppression at the hands of foreign enemies was not the only covenant curse that was being fulfilled in israel because of their apostasy
213721 reflective of the biblical conviction that a child is a special creation of god from the moment of conception the same standards that will govern his postnatal life will apply to his prenatal condition as well accordingly she must watch her diet abstaining from wine alcoholic drinks of any kind and food that israelite laws forbade as defiled ritually unclean and defiling
213722 begin to deliver israel from the hands of the philistines
213723 when your words are fulfilled what is to be the rule that governs the boys life and work
213724 since table fellowship assumes oneness that is shalom between the parties by rejecting the invitation to a meal the visitor comments on the spiritual condition of the nation as a whole and this household in particular the israelites are in no state to fellowship this way with him an envoy from the holy courts of heaven whole burnt offerings presented as sacrifices to yahweh must come first
213725 with impeccable logic and according to the israelite laws of evidence manoahs wife presents incontestable proof that they will not die god has spoken cultically visually and orally declaring to them the future which obviously depends upon their continued living
213726 distinguished above all as a period of peace and prosperity
213727 references to yahweh raising up the agent of deliverance and in the end the land enjoying peace and or security
213728 yahwehs raising up a deliverer takes an entire chapter 13 1 14 4 but thereafter the deliverer never rallies the israelite troops in battle against the oppressor and there is no announcement of victory over the oppressor
213729 yahweh must seek and create an occasion to disturb the relationship between oppressor and oppressed 14 4

213740 mothers profession the fathers actions the character of jephthahs half brothers and jephthahs own lifestyle all point to a thoroughly canaanized environment
213741 care and compassion for the outcast e g deut 10 12 22 particularly injunctions commanding one to love ones neighbor let alone ones brother as oneself lev 19 33 34
213742 another illustration of the moral degeneration the canaanization of israelite society
213743 but according to official israelite standards for men to treat a girl as a prostitute was both an offense to family honor and a violation of the marriage covenant with ones wife
213744 if she was a prostitute working in the service of a canaanite cult center the crime is worse still for then gilead has become a patron and contributor to the canaanite religious establishment
213745 the negotiations between the elders and jephthah were hard nosed and businesslike
213746 since they did not help him in his distress why should he help them in their distress
213747 left with no options the elders of gilead appealed to yahweh as a witness to their good faith in promising to make him jephthah their head
213748 that like jephthahs reference to yahweh in v 9 and the elders appeal to him in v 10 the entire ceremony represents a glib and calculated effort to manipulate yahweh in reality the witness jephthah is concerned about is not yahweh but the army of gilead camped at mizpah
213749 regardless of jephthahs and the gileadites views of the role of god
213750 what do you want of me that you are come to me to fight against my land
213751 as if they were personal between him and the ammonite king
213752 the ammonites present claim is a fabrication based on a revisionist understanding of history
213753 originally israel had no interest in the territory ammon is claiming they just wanted to pass through vv
213754 accordingly israel has never claimed any land belonging edom moab or ammon
213755 duty and passion was to care for his people which included providing them with a homeland
213756 yahweh with giving the edomites moabites and ammonites the land they now occupy
213757 are you better than balak the son of zippor king of moab
213758 did he ever quarrel with israel or fight with them
213759 a figure like three hundred years was intended to make an impression on the ammonites

213776 the candidates for change being named to the dccc red to blue program are running solid campaigns and are committed to making things easier for middle class families in their districts
213777 with less than 100 days to make their case for change to voters in their districts the red to blue program will give these candidates the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive in november
213778 i consider the lack of enthusiasm in seeking comments to be minor compared to the total lack of commitment to actually doing anything useful to mitigate climate change
213779 i commend cnn and soledad obrien for tackling this very important topic but to expose an audience to this theory is very troubling and disappointing
213780 it is one of the only cancers that you can point to and say in the last 30 years we have made no progress
213781 the smart people work on what there is money to work on if the moneys there i bet anything that by the time my kids are my age well have it licked

213834 the israelite military base at mizpah of gilead 10 17 he traveled through gilead across the jabbok river into the territory of manasseh and then back home to mizpah of gilead from here he went on to the area where the ammonites were camped and engaged them in battle
213835 verse 30 records the first and only time in which the man speaks directly to god himself
213836 manipulating god and seeking to wrest concessions and favors from him like he had from the gileadites and ammonites
213837 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me
213838 mean anything in jephthahs possession that comes out to meet him
213839 may be interpreted like many others a pious expression adding force to a prayer by making a contract with god
213840 extreme grief at being greeted by his daughter v 34
213841 were not rash or impulsive but deadly serious expressions of devotion
213842 creates suspense by opening with the scene of the conquering hero returning from battle to his house at mizpah
213843 when she saw her father approaching with natural childlike exuberance she picked up her timbrels and danced out to greet him the victory over the ammonites may have made him a military hero to the transjordanian israelites but to this young girl he was a hero simply because he was her father
213844 a pathetic picture of stupidity brutality ambition and self centeredness
213845 doomed by the very person he was willing to sacrifice for his own well being
213846 a victim of his own vow and of his daughter
213847 you have given your word to the lord do to me just as you promised now that the lord has avenged you of your enemies the ammonites
213848 let the lord the judge decide the dispute this day between the israelites and the ammonites
213849 in the end the nameless girls friends wept with and for her but jephthah wept only for himself
213850 jephthah was expelled from home and sentenced to a life in the hills because he was the child of an illicit affair this young girl chooses this sentence because she had had no children
213851 no memorials were erected for jephthah but the memory of his daughter was immortalized in a festival celebrated in her honor
213852 paid twenty shekels to the priest at the central shrine as compensation for the life of his daughter
213853 sanctuary for sacred service and then for reasons unspecified finds it impossible or impractical to fulfill the vow
213854 if the author found this act so abhorrent why does he not express his revulsion at this outrage
213855 abimelech had sacrificed his israelite half brothers at the altar of his own ambition so he could rule over his canaanite half brothers jephthah did one better he sacrificed his own daughter so that he might rule over a tribe of his israelite half brothers
213856 he not only violated the human race by eliminating one of its members an image of god with inherent dignity equal to his own but he also violated his own flesh and blood if homicidal crimes may be classified pedicide must rank among the most heinous
213857 jephthah led israel six years then jephthah the gileadite died and was buried in a town in gilead
213858 usually you walk past here at about 9am youre late today
213859 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion

213862 in general the department is concerned that the development of an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions may discourage individuals from underrepresented and diverse backgrounds from entering health care professions
213863 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
213864 you could imagine a group of people with less than honorable intentions seeking to get hired at a family planning clinic with the specific objective of obstructing access under this regulation there is little you could do about it
213865 but the bn wont be sitting down and doing nothing thats certain lets see how the bn would hit back
213866 by aspiring to be prime minister anwar now has to prove that he can better the barisan it is a tough call unlike the barisan components none of whom have strong ideological differences dap and pas are poles apart

213868 before the operation we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact hed have somebody elses hands
213869 when he woke up he looked at his hands and went very good
213870 already the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining
213871 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off
213872 it is difficult for me to continue i would have liked to sign with psg but i prefer not to take risks
213873 i would have liked to have been the paolo maldini of paris saint germain but sadly it will not be possible
213874 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
213875 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
213876 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
213877 when he returns hell be ready and hell only require the time to adapt to our system
213878 its a difficult group definitely but thats what we expect in a tournament that includes the top 16 teams in the world
213879 they are very quality teams we will face and we have to be up to the challenge
213880 improving customer support and helpdesk efficiencies with on demand remote support
213881 samuel has to have an agreement after this we will start negotiations but first he has to be happy
213882 we are waiting for this agreement if he moves itll be to a big club of course there are four or five clubs interested
213883 this was a very good performance i am not dissatisfied with anything
213884 i think we played really well tonight because we had so much respect for lithuania who i think can be a medal winner in beijing
213885 we lost the game and we played very badly but you have to look at who we were playing against
213886 we played against the best team in the world they have the best players the best coaches the best everything and they played their best tonight
213887 were going on a hog hunt were gonna catch a big one were not afraid
213888 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
213889 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
213890 tell you the truth i dont think he knew that
213891 i messed it up so bad i was bald for a summer my dad was my first customer
213892 i would not let either one of those guys touch me
213893 they could never in a million years touch my head to me both of them suck
213894 you have to remember derrick is a pretty boy hes very particular about everything
213895 when the righteous truth from his righteousness and committed iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby
213896 as an atheist youre part of a minority whose beliefs are constantly ignored and marginalised while religious prejudice is pandered to and encouraged and you have every right to be offended by that
213897 the invisible and the non existent look very much alike
213898 i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
213899 its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death
213900 it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
213901 religious wars are basically people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend
213902 the fruits of christianity were religious wars butcheries crusades inquisitions extermination of the natives of america and the introduction of african slaves in their place
213903 just because science so far has failed to explain something such as consciousness to say it follows that the facile pathetic explanations which religion has produced somehow by default must win the argument is really quite ridiculous
213904 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown if a form of theological lunacy
213905 we would be 1 500 years ahead if it hadnt been for the church dragging science back by its coattails and burning our best minds at the stake
213906 the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
213907 the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of anything else
213908 it opens the door for people to go confidently into generating reprogrammed stem cells for other disease models
213909 were on the threshold of a new era of technology where we might have some definitive strategies to better treat or cure diseases like als or other neurodegenerative diseases
213910 its possible to use these cells to make the actual cell type that is destroyed in that persons disease
213911 it takes the study of disease out of the patient where its very difficult and into the petri dish
213912 for the moment that would preclude the use of these exact cells in these patients
213913 these patient specific stem cells will be useful for pathological studies and potentially also for drug screening
213914 using these cells we can test chemical compounds for their ability to prevent neuron degeneration
213915 it essentially proves that reprogrammed stem cells can be derived from diseased human skin cells as well
213916 the hard work now is to establish whether the als reprogrammed cells are any different from those taken from normal patients
213917 we were given two ears but only one mouth this is because god knew that listening was twice as hard as talking
213918 im going to get something out of this lecture that i can use no matter what it takes

213922 they could move into this market very quickly given what they have shown off
213923 at the end of the day we must learn to think outside the box and leverage our knowledge capital to come up with value added solutions that are robust and scalable
213924 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
213925 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky

213935 we feel good about partnering with the sun belt conference as a contingency partner for the 2008 and 2009 games
213936 our primary agreements with both the big 12 and sec run through the 2009 game and year in and year out provide us with a great matchup now with 34 bowl games and nearly all conferences going anywhere from four to nine deep with bowl partners we felt it was necessary and good business to lock in a contingency plan in the unlikely event that we dont host a team from either the big 12 or sec the sun belt and its member institutions offer a natural regional tie with being within driving distance for fans of any sun belt school

214123 quality is a corner office issue and is directly related to brand and revenue impact
214124 by introducing test management wind river is significantly reducing the complexity of the quality assurance process which brings with it significant cost savings and time to market opportunities
214125 with software driving technology innovations one time testing in a closed environment is no longer sufficient for device systems
214126 added complexity of device software and competitive time to market pressure are driving the need to leverage commercially developed test solutions like wind river test management to keep on top of rapid release cycles without compromising device software quality
214127 the demands for increased functionality are driving the volume and complexity of code that needs to be developed and tested which is adding more pressure to budget constraints and shrinking product development cycles
214128 wind river is addressing this market challenge by automating the software quality assurance process which can contribute to quicker time to market and higher product quality

214172 the foundation of marriage has been attacked devalued and redefined by many in our culture
214173 it is our desire to tell a story that would allow the audience to relate to common marital issues and then to take them down a path toward understanding principles for unconditioned love through the roles of husband and wife
214174 our hope would be that after viewing the film couples and singles hoping to marry would be challenged and exhorted to pursue god honoring relationships that reinforce the foundations of marriage in light of a relationship with jesus christ we want people to realize that fireproof does not mean the absence of fire but the ability to withstand it
214175 we could not be more pleased with our relationship with albany the police and fire departments offered their services and equipment and some officers volunteered their time and others received credit for training exercises

214179 if we go back to the idea of redeeming the time because the days are evil this is the best use of our ministry time
214180 we each have full time responsibilities at the church but this is just something else that we feel needs to be done and is worked into our schedule
214181 thats why you see all of these volunteers out here in the hot sun taking vacation and personal time away from their jobs to help make this movie we are preaching a two hour sermon in the format of a hollywood movie and will be able to reach people who would never set foot inside a church
214182 they are doing this for more than here more than now they have a sense that long after they have left this world this movie will still be telling a story of redemption and will represent what they feel is important in life

214453 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
214454 nothing must be held sacred god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet
214455 what would it take for you to resist the government offer
214456 georgetown is and will always be devoted to shaping active learners the people who dont just know what others have discovered but those who ask new tough questions and have the discipline and patience and skill to pursue those questions to find good answers
214457 there is no place in higher education where students can learn and practice these skills vital to their and our future so well as in the laboratories of the natural sciences
214458 the challenge here is one of making sure that a core feature of what were best at gets better
214459 georgetown has grown amazingly in the last three or four decades in almost every area but constraint of physical facilities has held us back in the natural sciences
214460 now is the moment for georgetown to finish what we began a generation ago and take our strength to the next level
214461 will allow us to really do 21st century science and by that i mean science that is flexible science that is able to follow the path of discovery even as it continues to accelerate
214462 the new building will expand the space available for current researchers to some extent relieving some of the space crunch that we have to deal with now
214463 it will also enable us to concentrate on doing research in a state of the art facility with proper infrastructure for the most advanced equipment that we have
214464 both the fun and hard part of research is coming up with ideas and being rigorous in your experimental design
214465 were building space so students can work together more in groups the labs are being designed differently but all with the concept that you need to give students the environment to think about their work and think in teams about their work
214466 one of the most exciting things is that theres a lot of discussion going on about how the strengths across the departments will provide more opportunities for students to be more engaged in interdisciplinary programs
214467 while our faculty members all have individual strengths and their research programs stretch across the nation and around the world there also are lots of opportunities for students to understand science as a collaborative field here at georgetown
214468 thats what you had in the past but more students now are interested in research paths
214469 when we get them into the department they all start as biology students but as their interests emerge we can start leading them down these new majors and specialties
214470 say youre going to study a gene traditional study would look at the gene parts a b and c and what they do individually
214471 but now you need to have a biology program that integrates every area together so you can consider the gene as a whole and how it relates to so many other genes
214472 life sciences and biology in particular are changing so rapidly
214473 biologists have to work with other fields and collaborate to make better discoveries
214474 of course i took a lot of chemistry classes but being a geologist means knowing about other areas too
214475 i had the chance to take several biology courses and even a bit of physics having a little taste of everything is very important because you see how everything fits together
214476 the jesuit tradition of scholarship and its spirit of service are the animating forces behind everything we do at georgetown
214477 so its not surprising that so much of the research we undertake here doesnt just strive to advance knowledge but to promote the common good
214478 i was trained from the earliest stages how to do research and conduct myself in a lab
214479 thats really key to success later on because its the way science is done in the real world
214480 we do a pretty remarkable job of walking that balance and it is a balance the percent of undergraduates that participate in research is astonishingly high anomalous for a university
214481 when i was deciding where to go to college one main thing that attracted me to the physics department at georgetown was its attention to its undergraduate students
214482 class sizes were small many undergraduates formed good relationships with their advisers and teachers and students were encouraged to research early
214483 we are smaller than our peer institutions in terms of the number of faculty in natural sciences but our faculty is really excellent
214484 if we bring more scientists to the table that will be a main part of georgetown emerging as a real leader in science
214485 science is really driven by your ideas and what you can do with them and when you have faculty who are accomplished who love to explore the unknown and who are committed to immersing undergraduates in their research we will continue to have a successful science program
214486 but the natural science departments have plans to increase the number of faculty in the coming years
214487 and a deeper base of faculty research programs will have synergistic effects on the quality of the science we do within each lab
214488 a nice breadth with pockets of depth that is offer more advanced courses for the students who crave science education and want to hone in on their skills but make science available and possibly required to take for all
214489 were working to make sure that the science center and any future construction projects meet leed certification standards to demonstrate one way that georgetown is committed to energy efficiency and addressing sustainability issues for the long term
214490 the steps we take in our planning to increase energy and water efficiency and reduce consumption will enable georgetown to lower its overall carbon footprint and develop a framework to regularly incorporate environmentally responsible efforts in all of our capital construction projects moving forward
214491 this kind of program isnt happening anywhere else in the country
214492 no one else is doing this the students enthusiasm is infectious once they realize they can get things done
214493 we dont say were concerned with the whole person but if youre this way or that way we dont address your needs
214494 i remember that my mother who had hopes of me identifying with some good masculine figure became furious with the prefect of the dormitories when she realized that i was just as isolated at georgetown as i was at home and just as much a gay type something she considered the nadir of social life
214495 we wrestle with complex questions that bring to the surface areas of uncertainty and disagreement as our work must be authentic to a university and most authentically catholic and jesuit
214496 i approach this work from within my own lived experience as an educator and administrator it is my responsibility to ensure that the conditions for success are present as we engage the issues tensions and opportunities of these efforts these efforts are important ways that we seek to strengthen our community
214497 meet mentors make contacts and learn about being out in the workplace
214498 i have been impressed with the depth of engagement in the lgbtq initiative by so many diverse community members
214499 the working groups developed a thoughtful and comprehensive set of recommendations i look forward to joining georgetowns dynamic community building on the work that has already been started fostering relationships with colleagues from across the university and moving forward with the work of the new center
214500 with respect compassion and sensitivity every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided
214501 always our children a pastoral message to parents of homosexual children
214502 draw upon the reservoirs of faith hope and love as they face uncharted futures
214503 ministry to persons with a homosexual inclination guidelines for pastoral care
214504 as a catholic and jesuit university a university administrator or center cannot advocate for policies or practices that are counter to catholic teaching
214505 to bring some clarity to the term advocacy at a catholic and jesuit university we most certainly can advocate for lgbtq students we can and must advocate for respect inclusion understanding safety mentoring dignity growth and equal opportunity
214506 no one should fear any university community regardless of who he or she is
214507 but this does not mean that acceptance of each person must mean acceptance and therefore subsequent endorsement of views and activities that are inconsistent and conflict with the teachings of the church which must be a part of any catholic universitys mission
214508 a catholic university must exercise its responsibility and its authentic academic freedom to state and argue through reason why the teachings of the church are meritorious and why conflicting views are wrong
214509 i do get the question how can you be gay and be catholic
214510 what ive learned in the process of growing up and in the process of being in the society of jesus is that there is a tolerance and understanding of who i am orientation is not a sin
214511 unfortunately all of these events were totally straight as this was pre stonewall and there was no open manifestation of lgbt student activity on campus
214512 any indication of same sex affection would have been marginalized or worse while i was at georgetown and in the closet i didnt even know of other gay students or faculty members there were no clubs or social organizations where gays could meet one another there were no gay role models let alone good ones
214513 all of this placed a tremendous psychological burden on me throughout my academic career
214514 it was primarily through father davis guidance that i managed to keep my sanity
214515 in spite of his busy schedule davis always found time to meet with me if i asked to see him he was always warm understanding nonjudgmental and supportive it was very important to me to have father davis as my friend and to be able to talk to about my orientation
214516 we got as far as organizing a panel discussion on gay and lesbian issues in the hall of nations with franklin kameny barbara gittings and one other speaker i cannot recall right now
214517 i think only about six people showed up in the audience
214518 i also wrote an article about being gay at georgetown for the hoya and was featured on a campus radio program for all of this we all got called into the vice presidents office on the second floor of the healy building for a friendly but serious talking to
214519 we are your average middle aged suburban couple who just happen to be both men
214520 on the order it would actually tell you what the diagnosis was
214521 so here we are just waiting around for the next assignment and i was the next person up and when the label came up it said immunodeficiency syndrome we all just sort of looked at each other no one had touched a person with hiv before and no one knew what it was no one knew how it was transmitted no one knew what the patient would look like he was one of the very first hiv patients at the hospital
214522 there was a very spooky resignation about him almost as if he knew his own destiny
214523 he was very weak and his body was loaded with kaposi sarcoma
214524 it was just as aids was killing people and becoming more of an issue on campuses certainly there was no discussion about your sexual orientation there was an undercurrent but we didnt have a place to go to it was also relatively soon after the supreme court case
214525 i knew of one or two people on campus who were gay pretty much because they were involved with the lgbt organization at that time
214526 i think georgetown was not an incredibly welcoming place to gays and lesbians in the 1980s i think there were a lot of rough feelings around the whole lawsuit issue there were also few or no resources to people who were dealing with coming out issues
214527 ive been really impressed with the students who have followed me at georgetown and the level of comfort many of them have in terms of coming out
214528 letter to the bishops of the catholic church on the pastoral care of homosexual persons
214529 it is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action
214530 such treatment deserves condemnation from the churchs pastors wherever it occurs it reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society the intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word in action and in law
214531 i feel that my coming out experience was pretty unique in that it occurred right during freshman year when i was still adjusting to living in d c and with people of many different backgrounds and perspectives
214532 from the day i arrived on campus i realized that my orientation in all senses of the word would be much different from others and oftentimes it was a struggle to deal with at one point during that year i even considered transferring to a traditionally more liberal institution of higher learning but through meeting a few upperclassmen some gay some straight but gay friendly and some other supportive university personnel my experience changed significantly and for the better
214533 a way for me to tap into support mechanisms for my own coming out
214534 debbie was a great listener and provided me with some really sound advice as i was going on my very own journey of self exploration and coming of age
214535 all of my family from my 88 year old grandparents on down know who i am and love me just the same
214536 i look back on my years at georgetown as ones that gave me the foundation for being happy and complete in the skin that i am in today
214537 my process began with a coming out support group which later became known as outspoken
214538 at the time the group was about 10 kids that hadnt quite come into their own besides those people there were few that i felt comfortable to talk to my coach though was excellent
214539 at the heart of the catholic tradition we find resources that profoundly support our work for lgbtq students
214540 i am referring for example to the catholic insistence on the dignity and worth of each and every individual the emphasis on social justice and multicultural understanding and the gospel call that we engage all of our sisters and brothers in a spirit of love the character of our heritage supports the call to deepen the services and support we provide to lgbtq students
214541 ive gotten the chance to get to know a lot of really supportive professors since the beginning of this whole process
214542 it was a really horrible thing that happened and i think there was a lot of shock sometimes it takes something bad for people to start realizing the problems at the university and take the initiative to change things
214543 we worked remarkably well as a team one that included members of every conceivable constituent population at the university students staff senior administrators faculty jesuits and alumni
214544 the whole process reflected whats best about georgetown and im deeply grateful for the honor and the pleasure of having been called to participate in it
214545 if implemented appropriately the recommendations will do much more than what had been done in the past
214546 this has been a great way to give back as well as bring various levels of diversity to how georgetown works with its alumni population i am glad that georgetown made progress in providing support for lgbtq students on campus
214547 i am proud that so much more is now being done
214548 experienced as much if not more homophobia at georgetown than at home partially because of who i surrounded myself with at home
214549 and then he said something to the effect of well we dont discriminate against you people
214550 mccoy who has served as the part time lgbtq coordinator since 2004 has helped students by being someone they can talk to before or after they have come out he also has met with parents and other family members when asked
214551 i think theres a lot of self censoring at georgetown our students largely act very professionally as it is
214552 so i think that plays into how publicly out some students want to be much as you find in the business world and the political world i see students here modeling that type of behavior
214553 the limitation there is that when younger students get on campus and they look around they dont see any out gay students
214554 i am a firm believer that sexuality is a complex thing and sexuality is a very different thing for each person
214555 refers to those whose gender expression at least sometimes runs contrary to what others in the same culture would normally expect
214556 students see that there are openly gay and lesbian faculty here who provide a sense of legitimacy to their own place at the university
214557 and that as we are open that they can be open and that there are allies in the academic setting for mentoring and for problem solving and for support
214558 i felt comfortable coming out to a number of my professors both in and out of the classroom at georgetown
214559 these experiences helped me to grow and develop because i felt supported and encouraged by so many wonderful mentors
214560 a good deal of my published work on u s latino literature focuses on the dynamics of sexual and gender politics in the texts that i read and in the relevant social political cultural and historical contexts in which those texts are situated
214561 i think we need to respond to what lgbtq students require because these are our students
214562 we consider the whole person we dont say were concerned with the whole person but if youre this way or that way we dont address your needs
214563 come to a deeper understanding of who they are help them to make informed choices and provide an atmosphere thats safe for them so they can grow in who and what they are its part of our mission here
214564 its easy for people who make up the majority in a culture to decide what they think a minority group needs and what would be good for them
214565 but it is more important to listen to the voices themselves
214566 anecdotal evidence gathered from lgbt students at georgetown showed a huge number of problems that they were facing that had no answer in current georgetown programs
214567 these were the problems lgbt students at most college campuses face such as depression suicide eating disorders sexual assault isolation substance abuse and harassment
214568 we found creating visibility was a successful way to combat the isolation of marginalized lgbt students
214569 the report we issued following that class spurred a semester of activism around advocacy for a center on campus mostly driven by gu pride and other student organizations
214570 i really believe that the work that they did there in the time period she was on campus was very important and i think it had very important foundational implications for similar programs at other jesuit universities
214571 i cant think of a better place for her to get an education
214572 i feel very grateful that she was able to go there danielle is doing wonderfully now and a lot of that has to do with the preparation for life that you get from georgetown
214573 there certainly are people who didnt have the blessing that i did in terms of family and friends who understand
214574 i wasnt rejected by anyone and for lots of other people that is not the case even today with people coming out
214575 they certainly loved me and it was unconditional and having that support made all the difference
214576 my friend just said ok now what it was a big deal for me but it wasnt for others even students from conservative families didnt have a problem either and then you find out some of your friends have siblings who are gay
214577 waft up through the din of a party next door
214578 and a guest at our neighbors party was ranting about that faggot john from the gay group
214579 i was accustomed to formal discussion and disapproval of my involvement in campus life as an openly gay man
214580 but to hear this anonymously while lying in my own bed was terrifying people talked about me at parties i remember vividly the chill i felt down my spine laying there in the dark
214581 we have experienced the joys and challenges of changing diapers preparing bottles singing lullabies
214582 we have been so enriched by this little boy our son who we will teach to grow into a loving respectful and confident young man
214583 i viewed my junior year which i spent abroad in germany as an opportunity to come out
214584 its always easier to switch identities in a different country and in a different language coming back to the hilltop however was just as frightening as my first day little did i know that word had traveled back to campus that i was now out and that the gay group had elected me president in my absence
214585 transformational a coming home of sorts i embraced my activist role as an openly gay man and leader of the group then called the gay and lesbian student alliance galsa soon to be renamed bi galsa
214586 drew vociferous responses from a handful of protectors of the culture of georgetown
214587 we were very visible enjoying open support from administrators including then dean of student affairs jack degioia
214588 i felt that the campus community and the administration was extremely supportive and embracing of us as a group and as individuals
214589 yet society and certainly the institution i chose to attend told me that being gay was not only unacceptable it was immoral and a sin
214590 being gay at georgetown meant i did not fit in
214591 in march of 1983 when i had the courage to ask him if he was gay and he said yes i finally had someone to confide in someone to ask the many questions i could not find answers to at school or from my friends
214592 while a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders by finally realizing i was not alone in this world you can imagine the dilemma this immediately created for me
214593 i had a roommate who at the time was my closest friend at school that i feared would not accept me i had a girlfriend who likely would not take too kindly to the revelation that i was gay and i was at a school that was sending me a very loud signal as a student that gays were not welcome on campus by the very existence of the gpgu lawsuit
214594 upon returning from winter break my roommates two of which were my closest friends at school confronted me and said that they knew i was gay
214595 they said that people on campus knew i was gay too and suspected they were gay because they lived with me they felt it was in all our best interests if i moved out this was the true definition of shock and awe i was devastated
214596 could live my life under my terms without anyone judging me or limiting me from being a whole person
214597 being the best person i could i will be forever grateful to him for being there when no one else was
214598 since graduating i blamed the institution itself for what happened to me when in fact it was the actions of a few people
214599 i never did know what the school would have done with my situation because i never gave them the chance to show me i relied on my personal network of gay people i could trust instead
214600 i have dedicated my life to not letting sexual orientation or gender identity be a barrier but instead an opportunity
214601 it is an exciting time to be in the legislature while this issue is being debated
214602 i believe this is the civil rights struggle of my generation
214603 i watched video after video in the class where people stood on the sidelines and yelled and threw things at black students walking into schools
214604 under a democracy the civil rights struggle continues today where we have a segment of our society trying to restrict the rights and privileges of another segment of our society my parents raised me to know this is wrong
214605 but i tell myself that there are some issues that are greater than me and i believe this is one of them
214606 and if standing up for equal rights costs me my seat so be it i will let history be my judge i will tell my children that when this debate went on i stood up for basic rights for people
214607 no policy at georgetown has been more responsible for the ability to create a truly remarkable student body class after class year after year
214608 no policy has had a greater impact on our rise in academic quality and competitiveness sustaining our need blind full need approach is the central academic and strategic priority of the institution
214609 attending a jesuit institution where pursuing the common good and being men and women for others were central tenets that made me believe my collegiate experience would have meaning
214610 if georgetown wants the opportunity to educate more superb students like maria and amy and that is our mission we must ensure that family income is not a barrier to coming here and thriving here
214611 such students are the future of our country and they significantly enhance our campus intellectual life right now
214612 is that a robust financial aid program is absolutely essential to being a great american university theres no substitute if you believe in academic excellence and a society based on opportunity
214613 is that georgetown finances our financial aid commitment very differently than many of the universities with whom we compete for students and faculty once you feel that in your bones you see why i lose sleep at night
214614 in the 1970s father tim healy recognized that we didnt need a large endowment to start a need blind full need policy his idea was that we could create an outstanding applicant pool quickly and then build the endowment over time to sustain and secure excellence
214615 first we need to build a stronger endowment base under our financial aid program because it is precarious to rest more than 85 percent of a crucial academic priority on annual operating dollars
214616 second we need to strengthen the aid packages we offer students especially by reducing the size of students loans and third we need to build scholarship funds for the most talented international students who are not now eligible for financial aid
214617 every day i see students who faced any number of obstacles poverty oppression family problems you name it before they were accepted at georgetown
214618 they are so inspiring they embody georgetown to me and i know what they add
214619 georgetown is one of the most prestigious schools you just dont turn down that chance
214620 its amazing to see so many motivated students here no matter what their social or economic status is
214621 we all have the same goal to make the world a better place
214622 especially for kids from my neighborhood where everyone is striving for just the basic necessities food water shelter its good to see georgetown thinking about the bigger picture its inspiring
214623 there are so many groups on campus supporting human rights i feel as if the community is here for me
214624 they say i should obtain as broad a base of knowledge and skills as i can that will let me do whatever i want to do later
214625 i feel confident that whatever i wind up doing georgetown will have helped me significantly
214626 georgetown was my dream college my reach for the stars school
214627 each of these students is a success story in his or her own right
214628 but we cant get complacent and assume that some aid is enough aid i dont want these students to be so worried about their debt burdens
214629 i dont want them to sprint through college trying to graduate in six semesters or seven just because of money and i certainly dont want to lose the brightest and most promising students to other universities simply because those schools can offer full need packages that have bigger grants and smaller loans
214630 individuals with great personal means have made investments that literally transform the ability of the institution to compete securely for the most talented students we believe that georgetown offers a profound value proposition for that kind of investor because quite simply no other university brings to the table the constellation of qualities for the undergraduate experience that we do
214631 we believe a georgetown education is profoundly empowering for all students the emphasis we will place on financial aid in the campaign is about securing access to georgetown for more students and for all time
214632 ive seen it at work it worked for me and im here in congress because i want to make sure all kids have that opportunity
214633 as the son of a working single mom financial aid was a critical factor in my decision to go to college and georgetown was very helpful
214634 i was very fortunate to have been given a pell grant stafford loans a bellarmine scholarship and a john carroll scholarship if these scholarships had not been available to me a hoyas education may not have been possible
214635 concentrate more of my time on my cura personalis experience in my academics and activities
214636 georgetown is not a university that one just gives to it is a service oriented institution that one gives through to create a better world theres no better investment than sending a student to georgetown but dont ask me look at the henry cuellars and maria repnikovas and ben cotes of this world
214637 scholarships attract the most talented students regardless of their financial circumstances our unparalleled faculty mentors these young leaders and the student life at georgetown fosters men and women for others these elements are the cornerstones of our community and the core priorities of the georgetown fund
214638 giving annually to the georgetown fund is a way for alumni parents and friends to continue their commitment to service and in turn inspire todays students to embrace this fundamental value
214639 the program works because members are investing in something they love and feel proud of
214640 alumni get to meet the students they help through gsp hosting events around the country and on campus this is part of what makes this program so compelling
214641 gurop aims to benefit individual students and faculty as well as the university as a whole by strengthening the connections between faculty and students and emphasizing that we all comprise a community of learners and scholars
214642 research assistants develop specific research skills as well as a better understanding of the nature of research and of the wider research community faculty mentors advance their own research projects via the assistance of motivated students and they have the satisfaction of introducing individual students to the excitement and challenges of their lifes work
214643 research is not a science thing research is at the heart of learning
214644 mentoring is passing along ones experience expertise and wisdom to the mentee as they need and can use it in a supportive yet critical role
214645 put simply it is opening the door time and time again so the student can go forward and continue to progress guiding them through the experiential process including their mistakes and failures and most importantly celebrating their triumphs with them as prologues to the next step
214646 characterization of the stability constants of transition metal ion dibenzotetraaza 14 annulene complexes
214647 basically what i do is use compounds as a thin coating on a solid platinum electrode
214648 so using these modified electrodes its then possible to reduce co changing it into carbon monoxide and other products
214649 i think that undergraduate research opportunities are a very important aspect of the education offered at georgetown because they have truly offered an extension and reinforcement of what i have learned in the classroom
214650 my experience has allowed me the opportunity to learn about the process of conducting research in a laboratory setting it has also taught me how to apply the broad concepts that i have learned in my classes to my specific research topic
214651 wonderful aspect of the educational and research environment here at georgetown on a number of levels
214652 it is a wonderful mechanism for introducing students to the excitement of scientific discovery
214653 i have also found in my discussions with high school students visiting us that they are excited about the fact that georgetown offers such a program
214654 undergraduate research with students like dan is one of the things that makes me look forward to coming to work
214655 most well known research universities concentrate on research done by graduates not the underclassmen
214656 this seems to be a great oversight to me as the hope is that undergraduates will get a taste for research learn they like it and then pursue graduate school without the initial exposure to research it is difficult for an undergraduate senior in the sciences to know whether or not graduate school or a career in research is right for them
214657 shes not afraid to make mistakes but is careful and doesnt make the same mistake twice
214658 she can learn from texts online protocols other researchers or trial and error all very independently
214659 professor urbach has always encouraged me to do my own work figure out problems on my own and in doing so showed a trust that i had not expected to encounter
214660 many early research experiences of undergraduate students are much more guided in professor urbachs lab the entire scope of a project was explained to me it was left up to me to ask questions and read the necessary literature to start grasping the concepts and i understood at least somewhat the purpose of the experiments i was performing my opinions on various projects were therefore valued and i felt like i was a part of the lab instead of simply working for it
214661 this provided the perfect opportunity for me to investigate language impairments in people who have suffered a stroke or traumatic brain injury
214662 undergraduate research opportunities have been an invaluable part of my education at georgetown gurop enabled me to develop a close relationship with my mentor and become part of an academic community beyond the classroom
214663 critical in providing undergraduate students with a competitive edge as they apply for graduate school or medical school
214664 i quickly became a strong supporter of the program because of the extraordinary opportunities it provides our talented students
214665 ive always been interested in scientific research and programs like gurop help me explore my interests and see what the field has to offer
214666 research at the undergraduate level has allowed me to refine my career goals and really see what areas of science i am most passionate about
214667 as youre going along the line just put about a gallon in each of them dont worry about filling them up

214696 we think that conditions notably financial to develop in the u k are not met
214697 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group plc
214698 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesn t depend on this particular deal
214699 that wasn t the view of all of the shareholders and of course the government is only a minority shareholder in this publicly listed company so the board has quite rightly overall responsibility to all of the shareholders to try to find the right way forward
214700 i confirm our ambition is to be a major actor in the nuclear renaissance in the uk
214701 the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built

214705 what was increasingly happening was that we were casting people with talent and skill launching a whole bunch of peoples careers and they had no place to go
214706 for the ones who dont win they dont know where to go theres no management company for them because they dont want to be actors they want to be designers stylists chefs
214707 it was becoming increasingly burdensome for our pr department they were getting these requests for these people advertisers networks who wanted experts on air personal appearances consumer products stuff the contestants should be making money on frankly
214708 thats why were partnering with bravo its a way to capitalize on the shows brand
214709 but also from an ad standpoint we are creating opportunities for consumer brands
214710 the guy weve gravitated to the most is this guy richard blaise

214712 but hes also a guy who specializes in molecular gastronomy he cooks with gadgets makes popcorn balls with liquid nitrogen no one uses these devices hes like the brookstone chef the sharper image guy of cooking and the food is amazing
214713 we prefer to work with the hosts of the shows
214714 the qualities that make contestants great characters also usually mean theyre too colorful too controversial to pair with a brand

214719 we are delighted with the courts ruling today it removed the retaliation claim which ms allred had been focusing on and left in six claims which allows us to prosecute every claim weve made
214720 its tradition for the issue after a milestone like fifty to taper off but it certainly wasnt the case here
214721 in fact the combination of invincibles new costume new sidekick and the totally kick ass cover by jim lee made this the best selling issue yet having this sell so well after we blew through issue fifty showed me the series is healthier than its ever been

214728 purple in all its hues as you so aptly put it im both seeing and feeling purple youre not alone in wondering about what is going on in city hall
214729 purple purple purple purple keep fighting the good fight our city needs many more heroes like you average citizen can no longer be bothered with information about crooked politicians and inadequate city councils dont even try to get a few flint residents together to vote but ask that same average citizen the daily updates about britney spears or give free rides at the expo at peranis and open the floodgates for those of us that are left over effective complaining to the right people may help
214730 purple and red faced looking for our men in blue called 911 last week at 3 in the morning when four people were partying on my front lawn and refused to leave two hours later 911 called back and said they were too busy to come over and respond to my call
214731 purple purple purple yes i am smokin hot about the troubled times of our city i have lived in this city my entire 64 years and it breaks my heart to see what is happening i will jump for joy when this city wakes up
214732 purple in flint i am mad as h and not going to take it anymore unfortunately i think you have it right we have the elected officials we deserve the reality is that the uninformed and misinformed populace and lack of strong reasoned thinking in the majority of flints population allow this ridiculous parade of elected officials
214733 purple i feel the same way you do i see a lot of apathetic people in flint mainly baby boomers like me its amazing how many people there are in this city who dont have a clue as to whats going on and they dont really care it bothers me when people complain but arent really concerned enough to take action make a phone call sign a petition etc im glad im not one of the flint marshmallows
214734 purple purple purple yes i am totally aware of what is going on in the city and i am disappointed disgusted and appalled as a flint resident of more than fifty years i am indeed saddened by the fact that my fellow citizens have been hoodwinked to the point that they are unable to see past the bluff bravado and the smoking mirrors of this old pathetic man and dont get me started on the people he chooses to surround himself with as assistants managers etc
214735 they couldnt figure that out on their own i could have told them that for half price
214736 but youre getting their expertise no one in the district has the time or insight
214737 you must be able to let go of the past whatever success you may have seen whatever your comfort whatever your habits to me thats the key to loving life enabling yourself to step bravely into the unknown only there will you find yourself again
214738 despite racial comments nate riek cleared to coach at grand blanc high school in fall
214739 well i like writing but i like doing other things too and in addition to my daily playing i now go around the blogs to see other bloggers inner children who want to be comforted and healed i think leos inner children are getting bored so ill see if they want to come out and play and i want to send naomis inner child the lavenders i picked from my neighbors garden that kind of thing so i think ill let akemi write for this blog most of the time
214740 well maybe i wont have lavender around my dream home thats okay just a small detail to give up

214797 de mon point de vue williams devrait terminer sa saison avec son club en australie avant de venir en france je trouve amusant et bizarre quun joueur puisse casser son contrat au beau milieu de la saison pour sengager ailleurs il y a une r gle en france qui dit quun joueur peut terminer sa saison en australie avant de rejoindre la france en cours dexercice

214800 a propos de robinho les n gociations nont pas progress ces deux derniers jours mais nous avons jusqu la fin du mois dao t pour cela il reste donc beaucoup de temps la cl dans ce transfert est que le real madrid cherche un rempla ant robinho cest ce qui a pour linstant ralenti les discussions

214811 the uncertain market conditions have affected some parts of our uk groups business like most businesses we are looking closely at ways to ensure that we can better face the unfolding economic challenges putting this in perspective the firm and the tmc group continue to have strong growth and performances in the uk and across europe the middle east and africa which reflects the underlying strength of the business
214812 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists and that the oft discussed distinctions arent meaningful
214813 nederland heeft een erg goed team zij hebben spelers waarvoor mensen een kaartje kopen en naar het stadion gaan wij zullen moeten laten zien dat we de strijd met ze aan kunnen gaan zodat we met vertrouwen aan de olympische spelen beginnen
214814 hay muchos factores que hay que tomar en cuenta para que un arquero debute en la altura como la distancia que hay que calcular para atajar y embolsar el bal n y que el mismo no d rebote
214815 el estratega merlo debe considerar la importancia de los puntos que va disputar ante olmedo si quiere jugar con santillo
214816 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
214817 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
214818 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
214819 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision
214820 er zijn 100 voormalige geschutsofficieren die zeggen er zijn vliegende schotels die boven onze kernwapens bleven hangen dat is al voorpaginanieuws op zich
214821 vraag jezelf eens af waarom 100 mensen die met hun vingers aan de knoppen zitten plotseling over de rooie gaan
214822 om een lang verhaal kort te maken er is iets heel erg vreemds aan de hand bij onze raketsilos
214823 one of the officers i believe was just looking through the computer and found the video on youtube so it was posted on the internet a private citizen basically had witnessed the whole pursuit and recorded it
214824 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
214825 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
214826 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
214827 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
214828 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
214829 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
214830 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
214831 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
214832 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
214833 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
214834 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
214835 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
214836 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
214837 kami persilahkan mittal untuk berinvetasi di banten kami siap bersaing dengan mittal tapi kalau mittal akan membeli sebagian saham pt ks kami dengan tegas menolaknya karena privatisasi pt ks hanya akan dilakukan dalam bentuk ipo atau menjual saham kepada masyarakat luas di indonesia termasuk pemerintah provinsi kabupaten dan kota dan masyarakat di banten
214838 sekitar 60 persen hasil produksi pt ks dipasarkan di indonesia dan 40 persen produksi baja pt ks untuk perdagangan di dunia jadi kami tidak menolak mittal justru disamping kita bersaing kita juga bisa menjalin kerja sama tanpa menjual saham ks ke pihak asing
214839 jadi privastisasi sistem ipo bagaikan kick off pertandingan sepak bola dimulai mudah mudahan dalam perjalanannya hingga peluit panjang masyarakat maupun pemerintah daerah dapat memiliki sebagian saham pt ks demi kemajuan perusahaan baja terbesar di asia ini
214840 selain dapat meningkatkan produksi dengan ipo maka akan lebih tranparan lagi
214841 kita targetkan pada tahun 2012 nanti produksi pt ks bisa meningkat hingga dua kali lipat atau sebanyak 5 juta ton pertahunnya
214842 masalah mesin saya kira tidak ada masalah karena mesin kami masih bisa memproduksi hingga 20 tahun kedepan bahkan untuk pencapaian target 2012 kami rencananya akan menambah mesin produksinya
214843 si resulta elegido presidente eso a nivel personal me abrir puertas
214844 es un hecho de gran importancia tener un presidente negro si consideramos la historia de estados unidos hay gente que dice que no es para tanto pero s que es algo muy importante estados unidos es un modelo para el mundo si la gente ve que un hombre negro puede ser presidente de estados unidos quiz me vean de forma distinta a m si l es especial yo soy especial

214951 ntdtv a new york based chinese information tv channel last month had its satellite signal to china cut by eutelsat a french company which is one of the top three satellite tv operators in the world broadcasting to over 2 500 tv stations to europe india middle east africa and parts of asia
214952 eutelsat had previously tried to drop ntdtv but thanks to an international campaign supported by groups such as reporters without borders the global operator did not
214953 reporters without borders believe this move by eutelsat is due to pressure by the chinese government who are unhappy with ntdtvs critical editorial line of the chinese government
214954 i support todays demand by chinese free speech activists that the minister of communications eamon ryan writes to eutelsat noting that rte which is broadcast on satellite by eutelsat is a state owned broadcaster and that the irish government does not condone censorship

214965 everything is far from okay in china and the wall is still there when it comes to individual liberties and human rights

215037 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
215038 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
215039 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
215040 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
215041 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

215267 today autism affects more children than pediatric cancer diabetes and aids combined and it is important for people to understand that there are ways to get involved and improve the lives of children who are suffering with the disorder opportunities such as these really allow us to get our name out in the community and demonstrate that any amount of support makes enormous differences in the lives of children and families with autism

215333 our pace wasnt where we wanted it to be in the morning session so we made a few changes in the break between sessions
215334 the changes worked better for us as we certainly found some more pace in the afternoon
215335 we still have some work to do this evening to make sure we get the best from the car tomorrow
215336 i know that i have to do some work to improve my pace as well
215337 we didnt start the day quite the way we wanted and had to make several changes throughout the sessions in order to find the best direction for us
215338 we definitely went the right way with the changes and have made some good progress with the car
215339 once again the competition is looking quite strong especially the renaults
215340 the main area that we have to focus on here is qualifying
215341 its almost impossible to overtake around the hungaroring so a good qualifying position is key to a successful result on sunday
215342 the drivers and engineers will now spend tonight working through the set up to get more performance out of the car
215343 it was a very productive first day here in hungary
215344 on this circuit where qualifying is particularly important its no secret that our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive
215345 our main focus was to understand the tyres and in particular the effect of graining
215346 its difficult to know exactly where we are relative to our competitors because the impact of carrying fuel here is significant but it was important to complete our programme which we have done
215347 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress
215348 the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried and so i am quite satisfied with the days work
215349 the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
215350 overall we improved the car and we are moving in the right direction
215351 we still have a few things to improve but if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape
215352 a shame because i lost a lot of track time and fridays work is very important
215353 i hardly ran at all and therefore we are lacking information which will be a handicap for the rest of the weekend
215354 obviously this means the data from the other car will be twice as important as usual
215355 i will try and learn from sebastien but relying on your team mate is never as good as finding your own way around the track
215356 this morning was the first time i have driven here since the track configuration was changed so i was finding out what its like in a formula 1 car that went okay
215357 this afternoon it was the usual programme of evaluating the tyres with different fuel loads
215358 the track rubbered in quite a lot towards the end and as i did low fuel runs earlier in the session this did not show in our later lap times
215359 i was struggling a bit on the option which i had expected
215360 as this track changes a lot if you dont have a major problem with the car its best to leave it alone and see what happens on the second day
215361 the morning went well for me on the dirty track surface and we had no problems with the car
215362 in the second session the track changed there was a bit more grip and the car started to be a bit trickier to drive but overall this was not a bad first day
215363 if i can qualify well and we can have the race pace we had in hockenheim then a points finish should be possible
215364 after my accident in the last race ive completely recovered i tested at jerez last week without problems i passed a further medical check yesterday and i felt fine driving the car today
215365 as usual here in hungary it was a difficult friday because of the dusty circuit
215366 it was hard to draw clear conclusions because there was tyre graining that affected the cars performance and general balance
215367 so we concentrated on finding out what kind of behaviour we can expect from the tyres clicking here
215368 i love shoes and i think every girl loves shoes
215369 i already have clothing and purses and watches and other fashion accessories so i thought it would be perfect to dress head to toe in me
215370 just from traveling all around the world and going to fashion shows and being in saint tropez and seeing different shoes everywhere you feel inspired so when i go down and have my design meetings i know exactly what i want in a shoe
215371 they have a little heart padding which no shoe has so with the pads the bottom of your feet are really comfortable and you can dance all night long in them

215420 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
215421 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
215422 we consider cloud computing to be the model that can fundamentally change the current it market structure and create paradigm shifts
215423 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
215424 to develop high skilled human resources in the it field it is necessary to create the latest it environment for the education space
215425 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
215426 this announcement further demonstrates ibms commitment to our state and to our people
215427 i look forward to maintaining this partnership with ibm for years to come
215428 well for me its perfect because international travel is an obsession when youre a freelance copywriter all you need is a laptop and an internet connection and the world is your oyster
215429 over the past three years ive been able to live and work in destinations like paris london dublin manhattan miami beach panama city and many other places ive always wanted to experience
215430 right now i live on the island of koh phangan in thailand its wonderful warm and sunny postcard perfect beaches great food an exotic culture and friendly people from all over the world
215431 on top of all that living costs are super cheap
215432 put it this way just the other day i hopped on the motorbike im renting 4 per day and rode to koh phangans largest town thong sala to grab lunch from the outdoor market
215433 i was low on fuel so i filled up at the gas station up the street from where i live it cost me 3 to fill the tank and that should last almost a week
215434 once i got to the outdoor market i ordered green curry chicken with a generous serving of white rice a bowl of noodle soup and a pitcher of ice water it only set me back 1 20 for everything
215435 i can pick up three separate wifi signals from my room which means i can be at my office whenever i need to work
215436 another great aspect about being a freelance copywriter is that youre in control of your financial destiny instead of relying on a set wage you can make as much as you want
215437 want to earn more write more just make sure you consistently produce good copy that brings in results do that and you can make a lot of money
215438 it took me quite a while to discover the world of freelance copywriting but im sure glad i did

215443 were hyenas we take advantage of the weak link you make a mistake and were gone
215444 if you looked at some of the numbers guys were sitting on as we got into the middle of june i think it was very apparent that even their average year would mean a big upswing in the second half of the year
215445 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
215446 there wasnt a whole lot of pleasure watching that game
215447 we had a lot of baserunners and we were doing things at the plate we havent done lately
215448 we didnt get the big hit one hit here or there and it could be a different ballgame
215449 we had a chance but once again its the same old thing thats been going on here all year guys on third base and we cant get them in with less than two outs
215450 we feel tommy gives us the best chance to win
215451 hes young but hes mature and has a feel beyond his experience level he deserves this opportunity
215452 if i locate my fastball then everything else falls into place
215453 its just one of those things i dont know what it is right now ive just got to figure it out
215454 at this time of the season every win is an important one
215455 listen to the fans believe me the more they show up the better were going to play i know that
215456 its been documented and our guys are going to feed off that and they have fed off that its great to go into our yard under those circumstances
215457 i was just going to try to go out there and throw strikes and be efficient
215458 have been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer
215459 drinking organic milk may cut risk of heart disease and cancer
215460 increased intakes of ala may increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer
215461 none of the studies found a significant reduction in body weight and only two studies showed a significant but relatively small body fat lowering effect
215462 it almost cost us the game it was good that it stopped but everyone was on their feet yelling and cheering
215463 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
215464 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
215465 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
215466 its nice to be on the positive end of some history
215467 if you win a series against the yankees or a team the caliber of the yankees youve got to be happy about that
215468 the lineup has been pretty steady were swinging the bats well i think weve got the right mix going there but we just need to pitch better and give ourselves a chance because we feel if we keep the game close well score enough runs to win
215469 but its too early to call it anything other than one night wed like to see it become a trend you dont want to lose aggressiveness but id like for them to be able to tell a ball from a strike
215470 i guess you could say i had a pretty bad streak there
215471 the biggest thing for me is to make my pitches you cant afford to miss your spots that often or youll get in trouble

215476 but certainly coming in here and beating a good opponent at their home ballpark four times is something to feel good about
215477 i got behind early and didnt like the direction the game was headed but we hung in there and the offense came alive and settled down
215478 i dont expect him to go out and throw eight shutout innings
215479 im just looking for the actions in his pitches how he competes and mound presence
215480 it happens every year and guys names get brought up its just part of the business that you learn to deal with the longer youre in it
215481 if people arent believing in us yet they havent been watching baseball
215482 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party
215483 were a better team than what we showed the cubs in this four game series
215484 i dont think it will be a very happy plane ride to atlanta tonight but this is not a death sentence by any means
215485 in september yeah this would hurt we have plenty of time to recover from this
215486 to hit a homer that gives us a lead which weve not had a lot of lately is certainly a great memory thats probably the best ball ive hit all year
215487 hes a legend in baseball and this is an opportunity for him to be in a world series
215488 you have mixed emotions when you lose a guy like that no question hes a hall of famer a cooperstown man and a cincinnatian you dont do something like this without having a lot of different feelings
215489 we cant sit here and feel sorry for ourselves we just have to show up and play and just have some pride
215490 were going to get younger for the last two months
215491 we want players that are going to hustle and play the game hard and play the game right
215492 we need to give younger players the opportunity and were going to do that
215493 did i act this way before the divorce or separation
215494 are you okay are you sure youre okay youd tell me if you werent okay wouldnt you
215495 the primary benefit of this agreement is that it eliminates uncertainty with respect to future losses related to this transaction we view the final outcome as favorable in light of the numerous widely circulated models that assumed a 100 write off for this transaction this settlement also confirms our view that transaction mark to market adjustments are not indicative of ultimate credit impairment
215496 this is an important milestone in our efforts to work with counterparties as we evaluate settlement as well as other restructuring opportunities related to our cdo exposures
215497 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
215498 evidently no recording was made so well probably never know the exact wording
215499 and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you
215500 youve exposed yourself to be the lonely overweight repressed ugly kid in the schoolyard that is insanely jealous of all the friends the more popular kids seem to have because you cant get attention you obsessively desire by being outgoing energetic playful or just fun to be around you lash out with your writing at the others with character flaws you have deemed they possess because they wont sic play with you grow up
215501 you can see hungarian flags and in the end you can see subway station belgrade isnt in hungary and has no subway
215502 we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be
215503 the way we went out there playing is very good
215504 were getting hits with two outs runners in scoring position and were getting good quality starts were back to the way we need to be playing
215505 obviously when you dont have your best stuff and youre facing guys who have seen you several times its safe to say thats probably not a good sign
215506 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
215507 all the distractions were a little uncomfortable to deal with but now i know hes at peace
215508 it hasnt been easy but its time to work and put it all behind and start looking forward to the pitching
215509 even though its pedro and you optimistically feel good about him
215510 definitely not attend any lambeth conference to which the violators of the lambeth resolution 1 10 are also invited as participants or observers

215514 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
215515 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
215516 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
215517 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
215518 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

215525 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

215532 the program addresses concerns raised by aliens community groups and immigration attorneys who say ice unnecessarily disrupts families while enforcing the law
215533 by participating in the scheduled departure program those who have had their day in court and have been ordered to leave the country have an opportunity to comply with the law and gain control of how their families are affected by their removal
215534 this is an opportunity for them to come forward instead of waiting for the day ice officers come to the door
215535 its the political silly season and this is a very silly idea which seems more about public relations than solutions
215536 they are trying to put a happy face on some very brutal actions that have been destroying families
215537 this is the most ridiculous thing we know this is not going to work

215567 all men look for in riches are found richly in god himself
215568 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
215569 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
215570 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
215571 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
215572 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
215573 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
215574 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
215575 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
215576 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
215577 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
215578 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
215579 let us look at our lives in the light of this experience and see whether we gladly glory in weakness whether we take pleasure as paul did in injuries in necessities in distresses yes let us ask whether we have learnt to regard a reproof just or unjust a reproach from friend or enemy an injury or trouble or difficulty into which others bring us as above all an opportunity of proving how jesus is all to us how our own pleasure or honor are nothing and how humiliation is in very truth what we take pleasure in it is indeed blessed the deep happiness of heaven to be so free from self that whatever is said of us or done to us is lost and swallowed up in the thought that jesus is all
215580 what then are we to do about this there is only one obvious conclusion seek him what can we do without him seek him seek him always but go beyond seeking him expect him do you expect anything to happen when you get up to preach in a pulpit or do you just say to yourself well i have prepared my address i am going to give them this address some of them will appreciate it and some will not are you expecting it to be the turning point in someones life are you expecting anyone to have a climactic experience that is what preaching is meant to do that is what you find in the bible and in the subsequent history of the church seek this power expect this power yearn for this power and when the power comes yield to him do not resist forget all about your sermon if necessary let him loose you let him manifest his power in you and through you

215588 the fact that the city of minneapolis would give medals of valor and commendation to this swat team is shocking and outrageous
215589 we had the right house and right address according to what the informant told us but its unclear why she gave that address since the family had no ties whatsoever to the gang
215590 ironically the house is located across the street from a police precinct
215591 so if the swat team had simply asked the precinct they would have learned the family was not gang bangers
215592 they were acting in good faith on a warrant that was properly drawn up based off of what appeared to be good information
215593 their bravery under fire should not be negated because of the misinformation
215594 they were given medals for taking fire in my clients house where by the grace of god no one was killed that night
215595 is only short term help and by no means resolved the issue
215596 o god who hast prepared for those who love thee such good things as pass mans understanding pour into our hearts such love toward thee that we loving thee above all things may obtain thy promises which exceed all that we can desire through jesus christ our lord amen

215600 it was pretty much the same with the last record
215601 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
215602 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
215603 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
215604 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
215605 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
215606 if the two sides do not agree i have the power to impose them
215607 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
215608 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
215609 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
215610 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
215611 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
215612 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
215613 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
215614 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens

215624 wants to argue that a presentation should have only three points and is looking for a source to back up her position
215625 neither of these could supply a definite answer because there are too many variables if aristotle recommended using only three points how would he know any better than what is best for a given business presentation social science studies testing such theories are done by junior professors seeking promotions and their test subjects are college students the results are a load of scholarly crap
215626 aristotle did say that speech should borrow the rhythm but not the meter of poetry because a smooth rhythm is satisfying to the ear
215627 theres nothing wrong with using three points in a given case and generally my subjective judgment is that two to four points is about right
215628 finally i am not certain why an authority or a study is needed for to argue for limiting the number of points

215639 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
215640 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
215641 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent

215646 i am delighted to be taking part in climate camp this year and where better to highlight the governments failure to provide leadership on climate change than kingsnorth the proposed location for the first coal fired power station in britain for 30 years
215647 a new coal facility at kingsnorth would emit up to 8 million tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere each year and potentially keep doing so for 50 years that annual emissions figure is as much c02 as the worlds 24 lowest emitting countries combined
215648 despite all its climate rhetoric greenhouse gas emissions have risen under this labour adminstration any government which commits to more coal fired power stations and kingsnorth is only the start then claims to be aiming for a massive reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 is quite simply living in a fantasy land
215649 our political leaders seem unable to grasp a more radical social and environmental agenda they can no longer commit to endless free market economic growth which has played a huge part in the rapid generation of damaging climate emissions and then wring their hands about climate change
215650 the government should be showing real leadership in this debate with measures to tackle rising energy costs and fuel poverty as well as initiating major investment in energy efficiency renewables and decentralised energy
215651 instead ministers stick with their business as usual approach further enabling the fossil fuel industry to profit and pollute while paying scant regard to the average citizen or the environment

215654 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
215655 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
215656 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
215657 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
215658 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

215692 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off
215693 the main reason it takes my name instead of to be a band with him and i cant use that name without him
215694 it was the middle of winter and a warm sunny place seemed attractive

215707 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
215708 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
215709 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
215710 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision
215711 now cedric managed to wheedle out of me the fact that i have some strong political opinions which i try to keep out of here out of consideration for our international friends whom i would hope for the most part dont give a rip one way or the other and partly out of consideration for james bond himself
215712 ahora s lo nos centramos en la vuelta contra el rapid luego pensaremos en el olympiacos nos sentimos fuertes en este momento y aunque juguemos muy mal es dif cil que encajemos cuatro goles ante el rapid

216140 one of our users said it was like a poker game where you never got to look at the cards now this on line recovery tool is available to anyone and with todays economy the money it reclaims is more valuable than ever insurance commissioners should endorse this consumer tool
216141 those who eat my flesh abide in me and i in them
216142 i dont feel safe drinking the water from my well
216143 from my observation the water quality is not consistent it changes
216144 it is very easy to make a statement that streams are drying erosion or stream siltification is happening and then it becomes a statement of fact
216145 we are seeing the effects on our surface water and i just worry that next it will be our groundwater
216146 without water nothing else counts we cant live without it
216147 if we have real data to work with we are better off to solve problems
216148 people should have adequate water supply but we dont have control to do anything about that
216149 i am speaking on behalf of the north fork ranch where i live as well as for the thousands of people living in rural las animas county whose concerns and problems have not been represented by their local elected officials
216150 i live in the heart of the raton basin and have been living with coal bed methane development for several years now
216151 despite industry assurances to the contrary numerous problems exist and unless there is meaningful reform it is likely to get far worse
216152 we do have new rules addressing coal bed methane drilling
216153 i know the drilling incident was not on purpose it was just a problem
216154 but i am the one that has to deal with it that one night destroyed my dream
216155 we provided ms ross with fresh water for over a year we tried to negotiate a solution offered to put purification equipment on her well and re drill a water well at a better location
216156 earlier this year we quit supplying her fresh water when we saw the negotiations were going nowhere if she wants to take us to court we will be ready with our facts to stand in court
216157 now i can see the scars on the hills from drilling
216158 i know this industry generates a lot of income and i dont want to see people lose their jobs
216159 but id like a little respect for what we own on the surface a little more protection of our air our water
216160 creo que la m sica es parte de la vida de todos algunos piensan que la descarga es una forma ilegal de acceder a ella pero yo lo veo como una manera globalizada de hacerlo

216165 weve done well in the league so far and well in the cups but we cant take anything for granted
216166 everyone at padiham remembers the 1989 final where we needed two runs to win off four balls against whalley and ended up losing
216167 we havent won the cup since 1973 so we have a real chance of picking up some silverware and well be taking a lot of fans so were really looking forward to the day
216168 weve got a squad of 13 to pick from so the skipper will have to make the final decision
216169 but were just hoping the weather is fine and we can enjoy the day
216170 this is a nice day for the club because its always nice for the club to be to be vying for silverware but this will be a tough game and well go into tomorrows final as underdogs
216171 league form means nothing and anything can happen in a final
216172 but its important that we all pull together if were going to get better of a very good side
216173 they have some very aggressive batters and a very good pro we need to bowl well if were going to contain them
216174 were sorry you didnt hear it from us first but the album is indeed called a hundred million suns

216180 with such a comprehensive range of services for businesses and consumers alike and the incredible groundswell of early interest and support ramping up and extending our global reach is going to be both fast and fulfilling were already getting excellent feedback from major players in the industry and exciting times lie ahead for us all
216181 midtown is the ideal choice for our first north american office
216182 new york city is home to a large percentage of the nations total technology early adopters as well as the innovative organisations shaping the new media trends and opportunities of the future
216183 instead the televised broadcast of browns performance is said to have kept the streets quiet that evening giving citizens a distraction from looting and unifying the city in peaceful memorial to one of historys great professors of peace itself
216184 and here you sit on top of a glass mountain called success
216185 just go home kit go home and dont go to the alley at all
216186 before you bella my life was like a moonless night very dark but there were stars points of light and reason and then you shot across my sky like a meteor suddenly everything was on fire there was brilliancy there was beauty when you were gone when the meteor had fallen over the horizon everything went black nothing had changed but my eyes were blinded by the light i couldnt see the stars anymore and there was no more reason for anything
216187 i know of no one who will make a greater contribution to the future of america than this great leader america needs leaders these are very dangerous times this is the type of leader i would like to pass the torch to
216188 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
216189 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still constrained there are no clear signs its improving
216190 tough in the sense of the impact on family budgets
216191 but i believe the economic policy settings of the government are strong and we believe we are better positioned than most other economies in the world to see our way through these challenges
216192 the key thing is to have a strong strategy to see this economy through for the long term thats why we have anchored that in a very significant budget surplus thats why we believe that through a continued process of economic reform there is a way through this while helping and assisting working families pensioners and carers
216193 we are now in the ninth month since the election effectively a quarter of the parliamentary term
216194 janie norman may have lived a lifestyle very different to yours you may not approve of her lifestyle but she is entitled to the same protection of the law as any other person
216195 just because she lived in an alice springs town camp surrounded by alcohol abuse and lived a chaotic lifestyle does not mean that her violent death is just another statistic
216196 in the past juries have been somewhat indifferent to violence by aboriginal men against aboriginal women
216197 that did not seem to be the case here i had the sense that overall some kind of value was placed on her life
216198 it is often the case that aboriginal witnesses can be reluctant to be involved but its a credit when they do and its a credit to the prosecutors that they were able to get them to come forward
216199 in one year to lose one third of union members in that age group is incredibly significant
216200 over 50 per cent of young people cant even describe what a union is
216201 of those kids who are working unless they are in a major retail store the bulk of those young people have probably never been approached about joining a union
216202 it may well involve talking to kids in schools but we would only do that with the permission of the parents of the students involved and the department of education
216203 schools regularly have visits from members of the community who add to students learning experience including representatives from universities industry groups sporting bodies churches and many others
216204 in all things schools are required to present a balanced view if the subject matter is controversial principals are required to inform parents and gain their consent
216205 were looking at some things that might give young people the ability to join an organisation at minimal costs by providing a whole range of services including the major services of providing them information about their wages their conditions and their rights at work
216206 were thinking about even looking at providing services like being able to connect young people to better paid jobs
216207 qu tipo de regularidad puede haber cuando todo tiene lugar en una atm sfera en la que independientemente de que la verdad pueda ser demostrada en esta sala nadie en la tierra cree en la posibilidad de mi absoluci n

216216 its possible to learn the habits of learning these things dont just happen in high school they need to be slowly learned
216217 the primary years are an academic apprenticeship not only in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy but also bodily skills of application to work and independence in learning its not about turning kids into homework robots but teaching them to apply themselves to their work
216218 there has been inadequate attention given to the ways educational attainment is founded on embodied capacities such as productive stillness and quiet which are crucial to sustained attention and application in intellectual endeavour
216219 i often have to start the year teaching the kids work habits the capability to sit down and focus
216220 some children struggle to control themselves they dont have any self discipline you get children who come into the classroom and start walking around the room in the middle of a task
216221 the peace corps has produced a remarkable number of writers since its inception during the kennedy era

216235 we have to face the reality that even if we cut our emissions quite dramatically it will have virtually no impact by 2050
216236 why dont we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to do amazing good with all the people who need it right now and thereby making much richer much more resilient societies who will also be much more willing to solve climate change
216237 most big problems in the world are problems now we dont have to extrapolate 50 to 100 years out we have so many people affected right now
216238 if we dont do something about hiv aids in sub saharan africa then we have a collapse in many societies which could easily mean these societies could be incredibly poor and less well off by the end of the century
216239 if we dont care about the problems of bangladesh today then they will be much more vulnerable to the sea level rises in 100 years
216240 the level of risk we confront is a greater level of risk than virtually any other area
216241 he views these as if they are mutually exclusive theyre not theyre intertwined and you cant see a scenario where under even two degrees of warming the most vulnerable people in the world are not going to be a lot more vulnerable
216242 has given a commitment to retain the snowy hydro in public ownership
216243 our shareholders have indicated they wont inject extra capital the only option is privatisation and i accept this is a shareholder matter

216252 i would regard it as the most natural thing for your children and grandchildren to want to preserve their links with you and your name and likeness and i am concerned that if this aspect is not squarely addressed there could in the years to come develop feelings of disappointment which i think would be most regrettable

216258 so wrote shakespeare about julius caesar but he could have been talking about the darley arabian or even his 21st generation descendent northern dancer
216259 why is this line so dominant and will it eventually be the only line that all horses trace back to at present 49 of the top 50 sires by earnings trace to the darley arabian with rubiton the lone byerley turk representative
216260 i further applied for trade mark 10969768 on february 1 2006 and it was opposed by darley stud management company limited the sheiks company

216262 i have been in the racing industry for more than 40 years
216263 i have enclosed statutory declarations for ip australia from jockeys who have ridden my horses including famous names like kevin langby and mel schumaker
216264 right now i have 48 mares at stallions all around the country preparing for the breeding season and dozens of buyers from here to perth and up to rockhampton will attest to buying racehorses from me
216265 my family has been involved in breeding and racing horses for 300 years and one of my famous ancestors was sir frederick darley the former chief justice of nsw more than a century ago a well known racing and breeding man
216266 there is no way a person should just be able to come in and take the family name of another person and use it around the world for commercial gain and then preclude me from using my own family name in my business dealings
216267 we are just the little people here me and my son tim but our name is precious to us just as it is to any other human being including the sheik
216268 he might be the richest person in the world but it is not going to stop me defending what is mine and what i am proud is mine my family
216269 i have known kevin darley since our school days at orange and am fully aware that he has had and still has thoroughbred horses for years as an owner and a breeder
216270 i am well aware of his name and its significance in racing and breeding i was leading jockey in sydney for a number of years and was stable jockey for the late tjsmith and other leading trainers

216284 it means that hes kind of thrown in the towel hes given up this is what you see large corporations do when they run into bankruptcy the first thing they do is fire the employees
216285 these are real workers they are very much essential and for the governor to just one day because of a cash crisis in his mind say today i believe they are unessential tells me that he should have been thinking of that way back in january when he put his budget out
216286 while i appreciate the governors leadership on this budget crisis i cannot support reducing the salaries of our state employees to minimum wage if our state workers had the power to pass a budget then it might be appropriate to hold them accountable but thats not where the responsibility lies according to our state constitution i cannot predict when a budget will be passed but i do know this when it does happen it will be because we worked to achieve bipartisan solutions i understand what the governor is trying to accomplish with this action but i must respectfully disagree and urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
216287 i think that it adds pressure i do i believe that none of us wants to see something like this nobody wants to see people that are being affected that frankly dont have a part in the decision process

216290 more bluntly kilcullen who helped general david petraeus design his 2007 counterinsurgency strategy in iraq called the decision to invade iraq
216291 did not seek to clear that quote with me and i would not have approved it if he had
216292 if he had sought a formal comment i would have told him what i have said publicly before in my view the decision to invade iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error
216293 but the task of the moment is not to cry over spilt milk rather to help clean it up a task in which the surge the comprehensive counterinsurgency approach and our troops on theground are admirably succeeding
216294 david never claims to have said what you say he said i believe this is much ado about nothing as he says himself his views in general have been pretty clear

216367 i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois that doesnt mean i am always going to satisfy the way you want these issues framed which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option of running for office yourself those are all options but the one thing i think is important is that we are respectful towards each other
216368 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that was a phenomenon that started in the african american and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell and the jena six and on and on in the face of all these attacks why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interest and the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community in this country
216369 jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that an injustice what had been done when sean bell got shot i put out a statement saying immediately this is a problem

216380 now were facing some serious challenges in this country our economy is struggling energy costs are skyrocketing and families dont have health care
216381 given the seriousness of these issues youd think wed be having a serious debate but instead john mccain is running an expensive negative campaign against us each day brings a desperate new set of attacks
216382 theyre mocking the desire of millions of americans to step up and take ownership of the political process
216383 theyre trying to convince you that your enthusiasm wont amount to anything that the people you persuade the phone calls you make the donations you give the doors you knock on are all an illusion

216769 he has been a very successful division i coach at the national level for 12 years and his reputation and record speak for itself in his three seasons at mason as the mens coach he has made considerable strides in revitalizing some of the patriots past glory i expect him do enjoy that success on the womens side as well
216770 i am thrilled that tom oconnor and the administration have the confidence in me to ask me to direct both the mens and womens programs
216771 in just my short time here at mason i have been very pleased with the progress of the mens program and hope that we the staff and i can do the same with the womens program the history of womens track and field and cross country at mason as with many womens sports is a rich one the coaches that have preceded us have certainly established a high bar and we look forward to adding to that heritage in the near future as a combined program i look forward to seeing our mens and womens teams working as one towards even bigger things

216779 kelly is an outstanding coach who has had a positive impact on every program she has been involved with
216780 she is a tireless worker who is well respected by both her peers and the student athletes she works with were extremely pleased to have her become the new head coach of our softball program
216781 im excited to have the opportunity to join the unc wilmington athletic department as its head softball coach
216782 the seahawks have a great foundation in place and i am ready for the challenge of taking the seahawks program to the next level im looking forward to many years of success here at uncw
216783 i believe the agreement is good for india and good for the world
216784 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
216785 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
216786 and the concrete result of that i hope will be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test them at any time in the future

216788 el d a de ayer en una entrevista que le realizaron
216789 es duro cuando te abrazas con chicos y esos chicos son solo tus amigos
216790 la gente necesita recordar que soy joven y que s tengo sentimientos
216791 o que podemos adiantar que o benfica fez uma proposta e desta proposta n o sai
216792 n o h uma nica palavra que signifique alguma coisa
216793 our military has done everything weve asked of them said musgrove service men and women have put country before family and they have sacrificed to defend our freedom it is outrageous that roger wicker would vote against pay raises and health care for our troops and their families
216794 this is a clear of example of the broken system in washington that needs to be changed rather than looking out for the peoples interests roger wicker is knee deep in partisan politics and washington gridlock
216795 in one case we heard of a man bringing in a brazilian pornographic photo and saying make my girlfriend look like this we dont think it is ethical behavior to agree to do that
216796 well its not our home ground but its our home state
216797 i know theyll be flying to the game and well be driving
216798 but its always nice to have the home crowd support and i think there will probably be more brisbane supporters than kangaroos supporters
216799 and that always gives a bit of emotional stimulus to the players
216800 if we win three games then i guess we play finals if we win five then we definitely play
216801 having said that the margin for error is getting greatly reduced
216802 you would rather win now than be thinking well know weve got to win our last three
216803 weve had a couple of games where if we had played better in the final minute we would have won but we didnt and we lost them
216804 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
216805 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
216806 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
216807 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
216808 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
216809 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
216810 id be happy with a win against afghanistan at the moment let alone a top four team
216811 ive even been playing on the playstation getting wins on that at the moment
216812 obviously lukes got seven weeks of energy to use and we need him to go out and concentrate on his game and not get caught up any incidents that can take away from his performance
216813 hes an outstanding player and he brings a lot to us in terms of his go forward and as a defender
216814 hes just a guy who inspires other players and he will make them feel comfortable
216815 but we need for him not to get caught up in any outside influences
216816 the thing about ash hes got great footwork and hes a player who can chime in and cause some doubts
216817 carl played really strong last week got run under his belt and im not sure hes a play you want to take on
216818 his go forward was exceptional his minutes were good and hell give us some stability around the rucks and some authority with luke that weve probably been lacking
216819 they score a lot of tries from kicks they very good at that
216820 theyve got state of origin halves and theyre a quality team
216821 his progress is fantastic but he wont be back until the titans game in two weeks
216822 we havent given up hope of winning games or getting off the bottom
216823 the selectors felt that michael crocker and danny buderus werent deserting rugby league in australia
216824 they felt theyve given absolutely great service to rugby league here and they just got to that stage in their career where theyre going to move so they can lengthen it a little
216825 so they felt under those circumstances where theyve given great service they should be rewarded by being considered for this
216826 i dont pick the team ive made an opinion about what i feel is a leagues decision in regards to players going to england
216827 the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
216828 it todays squad is a great purpose of showing the players that we are very happy with in regards to playing in the world cup and being involved in that australian team
216829 and also for the players that havent been picked and think they should be there its a great opportunity to show over the next six weeks plus semi finals that they have the form to warrant a position in the team
216830 i think the local derby tends to make a great game whether youre going good or bad but both teams are travelling very well this season
216831 both probably expect to win the game and this time around its probably a top four battle
216832 we could probably upset our season if we lose or grab a bit of confidence by beating them
216833 im pretty happy for us to cruise by and let the other teams get talked about
216834 it doesnt really bother us we can just sit in the background and hopefully creep up on a few teams
216835 the stats show that the games are always very close and we dont expect it to be any different
216836 its a totally different game than what weve played over the last how many years
216837 certainly were learning about these laws just like the players are and so i think thats the circumstances that youre looking at and thats why youve got quite a bit of change in policy as you go on as you get used to these laws and adjust to them
216838 the players have been playing with them from the start so if they hadnt been exposed to them that would be probably more of an issue
216839 to be honest they probably profited from them more than we did in the first encounter
216840 weve talked to the players about various policies playing under these elvs
216841 i guess until you really face the challenge and you come up short that you really have to think deeply about whats going on there
216842 i watch a bit of rugby on video and try and analyse the game and spend a lot of time doing that and so do the other two guys assistant coaches
216843 we thought we had done that pretty well but until you get into the heat of the battle i guess thats the big learning experience
216844 you have to put that question to him ive got no idea
216845 he loves the job that hes in and thats part of the territory
216846 you dont enter this industry without anticipating that stuff you go in with your eyes wide open and wed much rather be here and feeling that than not
216847 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
216848 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
216849 an uneasy feeling that the mccain campaign was starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford a black candidate for senate in tennessee in 2006
216850 theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails and the latest one they got me in an ad with paris hilton you know never met the woman but you know what theyre going to try to argue is that somehow im too risky
216851 der dritte platz den gy ri in der vorsaison erreicht hat spricht f r die qualit t der mannschaft pers nlich kenne ich das team aber kaum wir werden sie beobachten lassen und uns videomaterial besorgen dann kann ich mehr sagen aber unser ziel kann es nur sein die n chste runde zu erreichen
216852 die aufgabe wird sein m glichst viele informationen ber den gegner zu sammeln wir wollen in den uefa pokal einziehen und deswegen m ssen wir uns auch gegen ljubljana durchsetzen
216853 es ist sicher von vorteil dass wir zuerst ausw rts antreten und es h tte mit warschau legia warszawa oder bern bsc young boys auch schlimmer kommen k nnen unser klares ziel bleibt so aber das gleiche wir wollen in den uefa pokal
216854 while many people think that a life insurance mans job is just selling policies to men to protect their families in case they die really this is only a part of the job a good life insurance man also sells policies that can do wonderful things for men while they themselves live
216855 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
216856 the seas will recede the planet will heal everyone will love america again the sick will all be cured by socialized medicine the poor will cease to exist the rich will give all their money to africa the government will become efficient sin wont happen the yellow brick road will lead to the white house not a fantasy land and the emperors clothes will suddenly materialize so that the whole world will actually see something there

216873 in order to address americas energy crisis members from both parties in congress need to work together to find solutions this comprehensive energy package is bipartisanship at its best a common sense compromise that will move this debate forward so we can help families struggling to pay high gas prices
216874 this bipartisan energy legislation would increase domestic production of oil by opening up new areas in the ocs for drilling and provide an historic investment in alternative energy to move us away from our dependence on foreign oil
216875 western pennsylvania stands to benefit from increased federal investment in alternative energy in particular nuclear and coal
216876 our region is a leader in the nuclear energy industry and sits atop vast coal deposits both of which could be developed into clean sources of energy and lower the costs of energy for homes and businesses
216877 high textbook costs are a significant financial burden for students today in fact one recent study found that the average student spends approximately 1000 a year on textbooks
216878 that is why i worked with congressman tim ryan to create a grant program that will expand the number of textbook rental programs for college students textbook rental programs have been already been a great success with many of them reducing textbook costs by as much as 75 percent
216879 a recent study found that 82 percent of employers in pennsylvania have trouble finding qualified workers
216880 by better tailoring community college coursework to meet emerging workforce needs we can prepare students to succeed in the job market and supply local businesses with the talent they need to continue growing
216881 the u s constitution clearly provides americans with the right to keep and bear arms and the supreme court recently reaffirmed this right by overturning the districts gun ban
216882 the second amendment enforcement act that i introduced today will ensure that government does not infringe upon the rights of law abiding citizens in the district of columbia further it takes important steps to protect the rights of gun owners across this country by demonstrating congresss commitment to upholding the second amendment
216883 no group should stand before our nations veterans when we make decisions about our federal budget
216884 last year congress provided an historic 11 8 billion increase in funding for veterans health initiatives that funding has helped to improve care at facilities nationwide today we are building upon that success by once again providing the va with the funding it needs to repair aging facilities reduce the huge backlog in veterans disability claims and expand access to health care americas veterans risked everything to defend our country and i believe it is our duty to provide them with the best possible care and services

216897 it is unacceptable that the us census reports that women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man
216898 this legislation represents an important step toward the ultimate goal of equal pay for equal work
216899 we must take every possible action to stop employers from rewarding their workers on any basis other than quality of performance
216900 i fully support the measure in this bill that punishes gender based discrimination in the same way as other forms of wage discrimination by allowing women to sue for compensatory and punitive damages
216901 a college education is essential today in the global economy but more and more the rising cost of a college is putting a college degree further out of reach for americas students
216902 additionally students and families face an overly complex federal student aid application process and a student loan industry that has been mired in conflicts of interest and corrupt lending practices this legislation today will not only make college more affordable and accessible but the bill would reform our higher education system so that it operates in the best interests of students and families while boosting our competitiveness and strengthening americas future
216903 more than 40 percent of students attending a college or university transfer at least once before they complete their undergraduate degree
216904 however despite increases in student mobility institutions have not adjusted with substantive changes in the manner in which they oversee and articulate the transfer of college student academic credit i believe it is time for institutions to develop new strategies to improve gaps in credit transfer agreements and facilitate transparency of credit equivalencies between institutions
216905 according to the american hospital association physical therapists represent the occupation for which the greatest percentage of vacancies exists in our hospitals across our nation at 11 4 percent
216906 this is at a time when the demand for physical therapists employment is projected to grow 27 percent within eight years even as 58 percent of our hospitals were reporting in 2006 that therapist recruitment was more difficult than the year before i believe it is imperative we add physical therapists into the areas of national need to ensure the secretary of education has direction to provide loan repayment forgiveness to boost the number of graduates of physical therapy programs who provide vital services to children adolescents and veterans
216907 as a quid pro quo for placement on a preferred lender list or for a specified loan volume
216908 we are more aware now than ever about the importance of keeping our nations college students safe
216909 national campus safety awareness month which comes at the beginning of the new school year offers a perfect opportunity to provide students with critical awareness that they need to help stay safe on campus campuses like any other community have to deal with crime and this awareness better equips every member of the community to protect themselves and prevent crime
216910 we must make certain that school administrators operate in conditions under which they are comfortable with fully disclosing violent acts
216911 additionally appropriate metrics must be put in place to ensure that the federal government can collect such data to effect policies to improve the safety of our nations schools until we can correctly define the problems that we have both at secondary and post secondary schools it will be extremely difficult to combat violence effectively
216912 i fully recognize that violence and crime know no boundaries
216913 we need the full force of our citizens community organizations religious leaders and elected officials as we seek pragmatic solutions to violence and its causes
216914 allowing insurance companies to take students off their parents plan because of an illness puts an unfair and unnecessary financial weight on families making it difficult for affected students to afford the care they need as well as the education they are pursuing
216915 i entered politics primarily because of my passion to improve healthcare in this country while living in a pediatric ward with my daughter i saw other families who could not afford critical treatments while my family received needed care through the militarys health plan i am committed to advocating for affordable healthcare for everyone particularly for our youth in addition when you consider the importance of a post secondary education in todays global marketplace this law not only does the right thing morally but also helps affected individuals get the education they need to positively contribute to our economy
216916 it is unacceptable that 45 million toys and childrens products needed to be recalled in 2007 with some containing nearly 200 times the legal amount of lead
216917 this bill implements regulations that will allow us to significantly decrease the number of dangerous products that become available for purchase and in the occasional occurrence when something unsafe is allowed into american homes it will be much easier for families to find out if they own a product that needs to be recalled
216918 congress enacted a law in may to help student loan originators affected by the credit crunch but the administration has not yet used its full authority to help non profit lenders like pheaa the school year is beginning we can wait no longer the administration must take swift action to implement this law effectively
216919 moreover the administration and regulators must step up their efforts to fix the lack of money currently available in the market which is making it difficult for lenders to finance student loans our september hearing will shine a bright light on this dark corner of our financial markets
216920 pheaa is grateful to rep paul kanjorski and to his colleagues in the pennsylvania congressional delegation who have supported pheaas efforts to seek a long term solution to the collapse of the market for auction rate securities we need a long term solution to unlock the billions of dollars of capital trapped in these auction rate securities and allow the marketplace for federal student loans to return to normal
216921 i have reached out to the administration since february because i have been especially concerned about how a lack of student lender funding could affect higher education opportunities congress has already acted it is now time for the administration to take appropriate action to fix this problem for the sake of our countrys education financial system
216922 i am very disappointed at the failure of the administration to implement h r 5715 effectively and i remain just as concerned about the ability of our federal regulators and the financial industry to fix the broader problems of the auction rate securities marketplace
216923 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
216924 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
216925 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
216926 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
216927 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
216928 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
216929 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
216930 we werent suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue
216931 its ridiculous its offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it
216932 we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again
216933 for a guy who has actually been the victim of attacks like this with his daughter in south carolina thats unacceptable
216934 i believe the mccain camp recognizes they need to define obama and knock him on his heels every single day
216935 its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
216936 these are the politics of nixon and atwater its transparent its indecent and its most of all its a sign of desperation
216937 i assume this is what passes for cleverness in the hapless mccain campaign that they think somehow it seems less racist to call obama a racist
216938 the democrats have always used race to motivate their base this year would be no different
216939 the only way he gets to that inject race into the campaign

216979 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
216980 it was pretty much the same with the last record
216981 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
216982 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
216983 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
216984 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
216985 sound currency we recognize the failure of the federal reserve system to maintain a sound u s dollar and the dangers of private bankers controlling the issuance of our currency we believe the federal reserve bank should be abolished and the issuing power restored to the people through their representatives in the u s congress with the stipulation that the u s dollar be backed by gold and silver
216986 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment

216991 some chiefs queen mothers and opinion leaders from the volta region
216992 we were all witnesses to the hard work and dedication exhibited by mrs asmah when she was a minister of the ministry of children womens affairs she was able to empower women in all parts of the country
216993 at the ministry of fisheries where she was the minister she continued to perform wonderfully
216994 there is a resurgence of such acts in the region and we would not sit down for our rights to trampled upon
216995 our tolerance has limit and our youth would not continue to allow themselves to be molested without any cause

216997 one was supposed to wash off with a chemical solution under the shower for 15 minutes to get rid of radioactive particles or material from chemical or biological weapons
216998 we used to be more reliant on our backyards and forests for fuel
216999 i think we have to head back there in the future were kind of going forward into the past
217000 the reason this is up and running is this has been an ongoing program
217001 it stalled and got smaller but were ramping them back up substantially
217002 the concept is to get the wood from state forests to concentration zones then get it cut up and sent out to the people who need it
217003 im trying to find every stick of wood i can for people to burn this winter
217004 auch beschwerden wie atemst rungen muskelschw che und bewegungsarmut bis hin zu bewusstseinsst rungen direkt nach der geburt k nnen auf einen schlaganfall hinweisen
217005 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
217006 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned
217007 makes clear as did the original order that all statutes have to be complied with when the intelligence community is undertaking activities governed by specific statutes
217008 rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
217009 if thats still the position of the department of justice then this entire exercise is meaningless
217010 this all could be voided by presidential fiat without even amending whats written now
217011 if the intelligence community is acting to further the interest of at amp t
217012 then maybe we better understand why at amp t cooperated in the warrantless wiretapping program
217013 thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people who dont have a job to support themselves and their family

217022 we met in a spirit of generosity and prayerful humility which enabled us to listen patiently to each other
217023 it is important to be careful not to make judgments because on both sides people have come to their decision by careful study of the bible those who take different positions regarding this issue have exercised compassionate pastoral care to homosexual lesbian people

217025 die balance des autos hat sich mit dem neuen aerodynamikpaket sp rbar verbessert
217026 das aerodynamikpaket das wir f r dieses rennen entwickelt haben bringt offensichtlich die erwarteten resultate und die leistungsst rke des autos ist vielversprechend
217027 mit mehr gummi auf der strecke werden sich die bedingungen morgen ndern deshalb ist es zu fr h um genau einzusch tzen wo wir im vergleich zur konkurrenz stehen
217028 extending the breadth of platform support in browserplus is a key goal
217029 alles in allem haben wir einen guten tag erlebt an dem wir die neue hintere radaufh ngung erstmals austesten konnten nach dem morgendlichen training haben wir das auto weiter verbessert nachdem ich nicht gl cklich mit der balance war
217030 nun aber war das auto viel berechenbarer und f hlte sich einfach besser an unsere long run performance sollte in ordnung sein
217031 es war ein herausfordernder tag wir haben neben der radaufh ngung auch neue aero teile getestet
217032 die strecke hatte sich seit dem morgen verbessert wir mussten derweil die balance optimieren wir hatten leider mit untersteuern zu k mpfen
217033 es war ein recht guter tag das neue getriebe hat gut funktioniert und auch sonst gab es nichts zu beklagen
217034 die balance war weiterhin schwierig nachdem die streckenbedingungen noch nicht optimal waren auf meinem letzten run hatte ich verkehr insgesamt sollten wir auf einem guten weg sein ich hoffe dass wir dies morgen umsetzen k nnen
217035 das hochschalten funktioniert besser mit dem neuen getriebe das ist ein schritt nach vorn leider werden wir es aber morgen und bermorgen noch nicht einsetzen
217036 wir haben probleme mit dem gripniveau es fehlt die konstanz nachdem sich die streckenbedingungen verbessert hatten lief es die letzte viertelstunde am nachmittag schon wesentlich besser
217037 mit mehr grip war es etwas schwieriger das auto zu fahren
217038 es ist kein geheimnis dass unsere benzinmenge hier etwas geringer war als sonst weil das qualifying auf dieser strecke so wichtig ist

217042 it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress
217043 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 its an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough were conscious of that but really keen about that as well these guys love that sort of challenge
217044 you hate missing any games but certainly i was really buoyed by the way the team played last week in sydney
217045 in sport you tend to find those sort of hoodoos but they always get broken eventually
217046 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
217047 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge
217048 hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand your actions speak gt so loud i cant hear a word youre saying
217049 it is unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
217050 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself and excludes any possibility or regularity
217051 as was confirmed by the current statements of mr holbrooke who regrets that there is no death sentence here and it therefore cannot be pronounced on me although that is what he would like
217052 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
217053 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
217054 speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger but not at all in matters of law and justice
217055 after the lynch atmosphere in the media and in public to which former and perhaps future high ranking diplomats of great powers like the usa have contributed so much along with others from president bill clintons team who are in a hurry to see me dead what regularity can i expect

217060 we know americans care deeply about the issues that affect them and their families and providing future generations of americans with a world class education is one of the most important issues our country is facing
217061 our new ad campaign coupled with our presence in states including iowa missouri and ohio gives americans the opportunity to talk about education and urge the leaders of this country to work with parents teachers activists and community leaders to create real change in the way we educate our kids
217062 new advertising campaign hits airwaves points to the dire state of americas education system and its risk to students
217063 oh dear they are at it again this time its a dog obedience show in their front yard
217064 it seemed malicious and couldve been someone ive dealt with before
217065 i came home and opened my mail and noticed that my bill was awfully high and i saw two purchases at dillards on june 13
217066 there are certain thresholds that this individual needs to meet in our behavioral detection program we dont just see someone who is nervous and pull them over to talk with them
217067 nobody wants their rights infringed upon but if youre not doing anything wrong what are you worried about
217068 so i really dont think nervousness is a good indicator
217069 at the time that we went there 16 kids were playing outside of the day care in the playground so we definitely dont want any of those kids or anybody else getting hurt

217106 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
217107 but if she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
217108 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
217109 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
217110 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
217111 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember

217137 ive been through numerous quakes and this one was actually one of the most unsettling usually they hit hard at first but are over in 5 seconds but this one just went on and on it was ultimately only 30 seconds in all but trust me when i tell you that it feels like much longer when the building is swaying under your feet

217144 i think it killed someone and ate someones leg off or something
217145 i didnt know where it was in the lake and it was eating all the farmers crops
217146 i cant believe ive been in australia for seven years now

217149 grant hackett has said something adam pine and libby all the people who have been through it before they have just shared a bit of what its like
217150 i guess libby has a lot more pressure on her than me given she is the world record holder in both events
217151 im not one for dwelling on pressure i just focus on what i have to do because hopefully my results will reflect the training ive done
217152 we constantly push each other as swimmers were competitive but were also great friends and its great to see her improve that makes me want to improve and when i improve she wants to improve so we kind of push each other along

217163 the net environmental effect of pelosis no drilling willfulness is negative outsourcing u s oil production does nothing to lessen worldwide environmental despoliation it simply exports it to more corrupt less efficient more unstable parts of the world thereby increasing net planetary damage
217164 that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart
217165 wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
217166 but make it clear that voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
217167 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
217168 it is far easier for unions to get workers to sign cards because the organizers can approach workers repeatedly over a period of weeks or months until the union garners enough support
217169 unions consider the employee free choice act as vital to the survival of the labor movement

217172 die anmeldungen f r die vorkurse laufen zur zeit schon sehr gut
217173 jeder kurs wird in der regel in zwei gruppen gef hrt die k nftigen studierenden haben erkannt dass ihnen der besuch der vorkurse den studienbeginn erleichtert im vorjahr hatten wir 150 teilnehmer von diesen best tigten 96 prozent nach dem ersten studienjahr dass ihnen der kursbesuch sehr geholfen hat
217174 es ist sicherlich f r beide tarifpartner kein abschluss im schmerzfreien bereich er ist insgesamt nur vertretbar mit blick auf die lange laufzeit und der ergebnisbezogenen einmalzahlungen er erfordert aber dass die erh hten kosten ber eine verbesserte produktivit t aufgefangen werden die l sung des tarifkonflikts durch die tarifpartner aus eigener kraft ist eine wichtige botschaft f r unsere kunden aber auch f r unsere mitarbeiter und den wirtschaftsstandort deutschland wir werden jetzt alle anstrengungen unternehmen die erforderlich sind um unseren flugbetrieb z gig wieder in der gewohnten zuverl ssigkeit und qualit t unseren kunden anzubieten
217175 bereits auf der grundlage der ffentlich bekannten fakten ist klar dass bei eingehung der so genannten
217176 die vom eu gesetzgeber geforderte wirksame verh ltnism ige und gleichzeitig abschreckende reaktion der bafin ist alleine im erlass einer sichernden verf gung zu sehen die vorsieht dass die den schaeffler swaps unterliegenden aktien nicht an schaeffler geliefert werden d rfen
217177 die kapitalmarktteilnehmer und anleger m ssen durch das an die swap banken gerichtete aktien bertragungsverbot so gestellt werden wie es den rechtlichen verlautbarungen der schaeffler gruppe entspricht denn ansonsten w rden die anleger gesch digt die im vertrauen auf die unterbliebenen stimmrechtsmeldungen und ohne kenntnis vom beteiligungsaufbau der schaeffler gruppe ihre conti aktien in den vergangenen wochen zu niedrigkursen verkauft haben
217178 seit ber vier jahren steht version1 als profiteam f r corporate design dem ksc zur seite mit dem relaunch der website haben wir jetzt die marke unseres ksc zu einer runden sache gemacht

217181 in the beginning it wasnt good at all i guess many drivers had trouble with graining so i dont think i was the only one but i found the balance of my car really poor we made several changes during both sessions but they didnt lead to the progress we wanted for the very last outing we then made major changes and luckily this proved to be a step in the right direction im happy we tried this because we now know a lot more
217182 we did the usual friday programme we evaluated the tyre compounds and worked on the cars set up in order to find out how the car and the tyres behave on this track we will now analyse todays data and prepare for saturday
217183 it was a productive first day of practice as usual we concentrated on race preparation the focus was on the tyre selection in budapest the two softest tyre compounds will be used now we are going to analyse the data we have collected this will be the base for our race strategy
217184 the effective proportionate and dissuasive reaction of the bafin demanded by the eu legislator is the issue of a protective order stipulating that the shares that are subject to the schaeffler swaps must not be transferred to schaeffler
217185 through the share transfer prohibition imposed on the swap banks the capital market participants and investors have to be put in a position that is in line with the legal statements issued by the schaeffler group otherwise this would be to the detriment of those investors who relying on the unsubmitted voting right notifications and without being aware of the build up of the shareholding of the schaeffler group sold their continental shares in the past few weeks for a low price

217195 i know the man they appointed to run security for the olympics when they won the rights to have them he was called in by the government minister and told the reputation of the peoples republic rests on your shoulders
217196 we shut down our critics shut down internet pages our government is too nervous about the western media to be a big nation you should be able to listen to criticism
217197 the world media is overly optimistic about chinas economy i dont agree with it
217198 we are developing quickly no doubt we may be the most populous country but we have a lot of problems our factories have low efficiencies we have wasted a lot of energy on things that didnt matter
217199 our culture has a problem our education system has problems maybe we are exporting lots of goods but we have hurt our environment doing it
217200 our pollution is already affecting other nations crossing our borders into theirs other countries regard us as a threat but it is not the economy or our numbers that is the threat it is what we have done to this land
217201 we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children
217202 democracy should be given time to develop even people with democracy dont know how to use it
217203 everything is happening step by step if we went any quicker there would be chaos
217204 i am disappointed that john mccain flipped and changed his position i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right you know the truth of the matter is these are not designed to solve a big problem but theyre all too often designed to drive a wedge between people
217205 in other words its a good thing to do but in the scheme of things it will have very little effect
217206 the epas pesticide incident reporting system has not been public until now
217207 by the center for democracy and technology the database was released under the freedom of information act to the center for public integrity in early 2008

217209 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
217210 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote

217216 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
217217 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
217218 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
217219 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc

217225 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
217226 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
217227 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
217228 one language to rule them all one language to find them one language to bring them all and in the browser bind them

217231 it would be nice if i adapted the processing api to canvas
217232 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
217233 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
217234 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
217235 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
217236 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

217425 when you put that ethanol in here it eats up the insides or rusts them out
217426 all the rubber gaskets and parts it eats those up
217427 tests completed on lawnmowers chainsaws weed trimmers and blower vacs with ethanol fuels showed no engine failures no unscheduled maintenance and good performance
217428 theyre starving for gas because the little needle holes in them are stopped up with the gel that happens when that stuff breaks down
217429 when you mix ethanol with your fuel youve now put a chemical substance in there thats going to attract moisture which is going to promote a quicker deterioration of the fuel that you have
217430 the alcohol actually dissipates the oil so on a two cycle engine youre lubricating the engine but the oil is being pushed away so its actually not lubricating the engine

217451 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
217452 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
217453 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
217454 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
217455 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
217456 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
217457 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
217458 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
217459 not only do i want an elite president i want someone whos embarrassingly superior to me
217460 the only way my identity can be expressed is 1069
217461 the third character 6 is equal to the relationship i have with the universe in my understanding of space of my spatial occupancy through this life
217462 to ensure that a proper name was found for her
217463 appellants desired surname is so bizarre that it would likely be met with repeated suspicion and distrust in both business and social settings
217464 i f a man asks appellant his name and he answers mister nigger the man might think appellant was calling him mister nigger moreover third persons including children hearing the epithet may be embarrassed shocked or offended by simply hearing the word this example illustrates how use of the name may be confusing with the potential for violence
217465 the big papers assembling quite a list of matters on which the candidate has changed his position including iraq abortion rights federal aid to faith based social services capital punishment gun control public financing of campaigns and wiretapping
217466 if someone passed him a joint he would take a drag wed smoke or have one extra beer but he would not even do as much as other people on campus he was not even close to being a party animal
217467 h e suggested that hed always said the surge would decrease violence in iraq thats not just spin its not true
217468 there is one patient i have to tell you about
217469 hes quiet now so he shouldnt give you any trouble
217470 but if he does just snow him with more haldol and ativan
217471 the pakistani military as is its custom denied knowledge of the missile strike and whether it had been carried out by the united states
217472 the united states supports the democracy and supports the sovereignty of pakistan
217473 complement our manned airplanes with an increased amount of unmanned attack platforms
217474 the capability that i am providing comes at less manpower on the ground
217475 going flexi is good for the environment and good for your health
217476 poll released last week americans seem to be listening thirteen percent of u
217477 a halfway house between flesh eating and a truly human civilized diet
217478 there shall be no violation of the confidentiality of the spoken utterances writings or records of a person
217479 a lot of companies that were vested right around the bubble theyre maturing
217480 but the ipo market is so inhospitable these companies arent even trying to go public the public money isnt coming and the vcs have to write another check
217481 what would it cost to build a house if you also had to create all the nails
217482 i have one company merchant circle that provides advertising businesses
217483 they have only 15 employees and they have 5 000 paying customers i was meeting with a few entrepreneurs from social gaming site playfish who told me they dont own a single server everything is on a cloud e mail accounting file sharing is hosted on a cloud and theyre serving millions of game players a day if youre burning 1 million a month its a really expensive experiment to fail but if your burn rate is 100 000 a month you can go a long way with just a little bit of angel financing and see if you can tweak your product just right so you can afford to wait
217484 before facebook in order for a dot com or an app to woo users to their site and get them go come back 10 or 15 times a week you had to spend a lot of money with google and others promoting your wares with facebook an app doesnt have to spend their money on customer acquisition
217485 the more unique your company the greater the value of your company
217486 if youre one of 20 companies doing the same thing theres not a lot of differentiation and if a large company wants to buy one they have 20 to choose from the lower the barriers to entry the noisier the marketplace
217487 facebook could have sold the whole thing for 15 billion but they wont be able to get that in a year
217488 even now they cant get it so there was a feeding frenzy six months ago maybe they should have taken the money and run
217489 unusual for a defense secretary to offer a comprehensive military strategy so late in an administrations tenure
217490 portray himself as presidential run the risk of appearing arrogant or presumptuous
217491 right now both campaigns have to do the same thing which is establish who barack obama is
217492 it could be the coca cola strategy of marketing that theyre trying to apply to dr pepper
217493 whats damaging the mccain campaign now i suspect is that this fiercely independent man is trying to please other people
217494 he should give that up and be the person whose voice shines through the pages of his life story
217495 someone in the mccain circle had better do some straight talking to the candidate
217496 competing as if he expects the other side to lose it for him
217497 ive never voted for a tax increase in 24 years
217498 never ever not under any president including president reagan and i will never vote for a tax increase nor support a tax increase
217499 the economy had adjusted the tax cuts were there and if it would have been and thats the way it was designed it wouldve been tantamount to a tax increase
217500 mccain has slowly tried to reinvent himself as a taxpayer friendly senator
217501 t he reason major reason why i was opposed to it was because there was no spending cuts i was proud to be part a foot soldier in the reagan revolution and we had tax cuts but we had spending cuts that went right along with it
217502 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
217503 aligned himself with the likes of ted kennedy in his rhetorical attacks in 2001 and 2003
217504 issued a lifetime channel sentence during the penalty phase of his trial the abused wife who didnt mean to kill her policeman husband in self defense
217505 empty nesters who have found a new freedom in their lives after the kids have left and who look at the world very differently than do their kids graduating college
217506 they believe that the country has had a fundamental break in values from the past
217507 this is parsing words out of campaign appearances to an unreasonable degree
217508 he has certainly im sure said things in town halls
217509 you dont say id like to reduce it to 28 percent then 26 percent then 25 percent then no one talks like that on the stump you say id like to get it down to 25 percent
217510 we were honest about the fact that we dont have a specific proposal
217511 indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
217512 he could meet gen petraeus and he could meet ambassador ryan crocker and he could see he could see the fact that sadr city is quiet
217513 he could see that the maliki government has taken control of basra he could see that the iraqi military is leading the fight in these places with the support of american troops
217514 obama has done shockingly little to educate himself firsthand about the war in iraq
217515 obamas failure to visit iraq listen and learn firsthand and witness the surges progress demonstrates weak leadership that disqualifies him from being commander in chief
217516 theres no candidate out there who consistently stands for individual liberties
217517 you saw that with obamas embrace of the foreign intelligence surveillance act
217518 well raised hackles amongst some in the maybe thats why the cw going into the third annual netroots nation conference was about obama blogger tensions
217519 his voting record is more to the left than the announced socialist in the united states senate bernie sanders of vermont
217520 theres nothing to base that on as far as i know
217521 one wall is the avant garde the other is the past i want to escape
217522 some kind of flea market half real half unreal a world where everything is falling in

217536 nolan appears to have no clue how to stage or shoot action

217541 youre looking forward now to a much different life for yourself
217542 there are some one way conversations going on cause ive said i cant talk but i certainly can listen
217543 the thing thats important for someone with my experience to talk about is the state of politics in washington
217544 its created what i call a extremely dysfunctional hyperpartisan senate were getting little to nothing done
217545 could romney be planning to establish residency in california with an eye on the governors seat gov schwarzenegger is forced out by term limits in 2010 stay tuned
217546 governor romney has been looking at property on the west coast because he has family in california and because his wife ann spends a good deal of time there riding horses
217547 the number of deviant offenders a community can afford to recognize is likely to remain stable over time
217548 malta is not an obvious place for a love affair to flourish not unlike staten island it tends to be a conservative place
217549 word about the affair spread and republican officials soon became concerned fearing it would be exposed sources said
217550 a pattern of conduct was exhibited among many individuals to remain willfully ignorant
217551 i lost confidence in her and im not going to kid you
217552 i was also concerned with this other relationship thing it didnt look like it should
217553 at least 70 frivolous duplicative and repetitive actions in this court

217559 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
217560 in this time of war i simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror
217561 we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of evil extremism
217562 as a lifelong hunter i didnt want to miss the start of varmint season
217563 its tenacious coverage of the twists and turns in the scandal involving the states senator larry craig
217564 this was news to most idaho voters who have viewed the whole affair with shock outrage embarrassment and dismay but craig didnt stop there
217565 i know ill love it because clean air clean water and many many many mountains
217566 my heart my mind my body my soul my thoughts are in this to win
217567 if i save one babys life it will be worth it
217568 voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition
217569 the people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this
217570 the pirates are not in a rebuilding mode were in a building mode
217571 trolling for sex in a mens room doesnt logically require that you support gay marriage
217572 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself
217573 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
217574 youve got this built in campaign team with your sons
217575 to discuss the former massachusetts governor becoming the face of conservatism
217576 was it for this that all that blood was shed
217577 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it
217578 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us
217579 you could tell everybody at the table sitting with romney was asking himself is he the one
217580 i sampled all of the alaskan classics moose salmon and whale oh so good
217581 in an important if tentative milestone for stability in iraq
217582 a counter terrorism campaign that has lost momentum and is beset by frustration
217583 the bill raises the national debt ceiling to 10 6 trillion the first time that the limit on the governments credit card has grown to 14 digits
217584 part of a general decline in violence that is resonating in american as well as iraqi politics
217585 to the point that many quietly supported american military sweeps against the group
217586 confined largely to a collection of crumbling bases in northwestern pakistan most are on remote pakistani military outposts where they are kept on a short leash under an awkward arrangement with their hosts rarely allowed to leave and often left with little to do but plead with their pakistani counterparts to act
217587 hopefully it gives voters a sense that i can in fact and do operate effectively on the international stage
217588 that may not be decisive for the average voter right now given our economic troubles but its knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later
217589 any campaign in part is about whether people can picture a candidate in that role
217590 pushe d real news off the front page for 13 days
217591 to me the project wasnt worth 13 days all on page 1 and the new information wasnt highlighted sufficiently
217592 based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack
217593 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
217594 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
217595 there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
217596 i remember everything i remember it being sunny and hot i had my window down
217597 the next thing i knew the concrete started to wave in front of me
217598 the bridge pulled apart in front of me and i went sliding
217599 i said i will not die on that bridge i am not going to die today
217600 this is not the way i am going to go
217601 when i hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient that scares me and i think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very very important and should be a welcome trend in the united states
217602 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken
217603 it is time for a new a different and a better approach
217604 we are looking at mileage based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel we are looking at private sector investments
217605 you would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses yet this was one they failed to accurately assess it was like a meteor falling to the ground
217606 i say how did we get money for stadiums how did we get money for all these new stadiums were building
217607 whats more important baseball or safe traveling should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now
217608 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
217609 my name is tim but my native american name is soaring eagle
217610 doesnt look like the other presidents on the dollar bill
217611 my job plan is for you to get off your but and look for one
217612 according to nielsen netratings youtube is the sixth largest internet destination
217613 from our past experience with bbc broadcasts we know its not just our own students who watch our educational programmes were sharing knowledge with thousands more
217614 through youtube even more people can benefit from our learning materials they can share the videos with other people and well be able to respond to their views itll be another place for our staff and students around the world to be part of a virtual learning community but open to all to watch and contribute the best thing is that being online its available 24 7 around the world
217615 were very excited that youtube users worldwide will be able to view comment on and respond to high quality content provided by the ou and our other academic partners
217616 we hope that this will create an open forum for people all around the world to share ideas and take part in academic debate the ous founding principles of openness and inclusiveness in the field of education sit closely with youtubes mission and we look forward to a fruitful relationship in the future
217617 my only wish is to play with a stronger team if zenit agrees with chelsea or arsenal i will gladly join either of them
217618 adebayor is one of the biggest players in football at the moment
217619 there are possibly four or five strikers who could come to our club one of biggest in europe and of course adebayor is one of them
217620 we will study all our options but our squad is complete and we are happy so first we need to sell other players
217621 if we can sell we can try to get another player
217622 im ready to stay at barca if nothing happens before august 31 the transfer deadline then ill stay here
217623 we feel that we are right the player has a contract with us and we feel he should be with us for the champions league
217624 they come from abroad very smartly dressed like tourists with plenty of money they have 4x4s and silent guns and they are proving a menace the authorities are trying to catch them but its not always possible
217625 but we set up a special tent for him and his advisers so that he could recharge his batteries he was a perfect guest and his team of bodyguards seemed to look after him so it made it quite easy for us
217626 the allegation that the familys assets can be traced back to the time of the third reich defrauds fifty years of entrepreneurial success on the part of my great grandfather emil and my grandfather guenther quandt before the year 1933
217627 the court did not accept the claim against the influential minister goebbels and the lawyer representing my grandfather was removed from his leading position in the lawyers association

217692 if that involves going to prison and i really really do not want to go then that is what i am prepared to do
217693 i think many more people will now follow in the footsteps of these five and be prepared to go prison to get the message about climate change across

217807 australia will approach the discussions in the nsg in the same positive and constructive manner that it approached the iaea deliberations
217808 after careful consideration the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
217809 the agreement will expand very significantly the application of international safeguards to indias nuclear facilities
217810 it is a welcome step it is a historic day for the country it is a success of our diplomacy and our political leadership which successfully negotiated with the iaea
217811 we will be successful in arriving at an agreement with the nsg and also in remaining steps
217812 burns had said that the hyde act will prevail but our government says the us law will have no impact we have been opposing the deal because it is not in indias interest and that is why we withdrew support there is no change in the left position
217813 we are not getting the nuclear weapon status either de facto or de jure
217814 it is shrouded by the ambiguity of nuclear sovereignty of the country which was not addressed by the government till date while highly placed officers in us have suggested that hyde act would prevail
217815 the step taken is an illegitimate one and lacks the consensus and public opinion required for any such vital matter of national importance
217816 burns said on thursday at a seminar in brooklyn institute us that the hyde act and the 123 agreement are supplementary and complementary he said that us can annul the agreement if india goes to explode the nuclear bomb again
217817 external affairs minister pranab mukerjee said in parliament that the hyde act and 123 agreement were different the indian prime minister has claimed that there is no cap on the right to test we demand that the government react to burns statement
217818 burns has been visiting india for the past three yearsto discuss this nuclear deal on behalf of the us so if he makes a comment it is a very serious observation he knew the entire 123 agreement being the architect of the same and his observation confirms bjps apprehension that the deal in its present form compromises our nuclear deterrent capacity

217825 we welcome it we believe the agreement to be consistent with the high standards used by the iaea for safeguards
217826 fridays approval of india specific safeguards agreement by the iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the indo us civil nuclear cooperation initiative
217827 we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
217828 we believe it will make a significant contribution to energy and climate security
217829 it also represents a gain for the non proliferation regime by bringing india further into an thereby strengthening the broader non proliferation framework

217836 when american families are burdened by skyrocketing gas prices it is a shame that the majority leadership of this congress would call for early adjournment for a five week recess rather than bring bipartisan energy legislation to the floor for a vote

217846 its nerve rackingly crowded and people give me dirty looks
217847 everyone i know who has biked has met with some kind of injury
217848 too narrow and you dont want to be hugging the door zone
217849 theres something about being in the car that is kind of anonymous its a veil to hide behind and people seem to like to get their aggression out on cyclists

217856 los medios de comunicaci n internacionales siguieron con esta caza de brujas y yo no estaba en la posici n de poder defenderme por lo que es inimaginable que la mayor a de esta corte pueda absolverme

217862 thats wrong and we will condemn it when it occurs among us and discourage it
217863 the solution to trolls is to stop taking them seriously
217864 not to take it seriously by force and refashioning the internet into a totalitarian space in which only the boot on face has any validity this simply has to be resisted to say that victims of trolling need to shrug off cyber bullying and harassment is to capitulate to their evil

217878 a equipa est a crescer e tenho a certeza pelo menos h um compromisso neste sentido de que vamos atingir o nosso grande objectivo que sermos campe es
217879 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
217880 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
217881 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
217882 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
217883 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
217884 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
217885 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
217886 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
217887 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
217888 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
217889 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
217890 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
217891 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
217892 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
217893 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
217894 we had a chance but once again its the same old thing thats been going on here all year guys on third base and we cant get them in with less than two outs

217905 se o psoe non responde a estas cuesti ns non pode dicir que defende a transparencia nin o interese xeral e ser c mplice escurantismo co que o goberno de anxo garc a seoane tramitou este plan
217906 non cont n m is que xeneralidades e obviedades que non aclaran nada acerca da postura deste grupo sobre os aspectos cruciais do plan
217907 fala de completar as mallas urbanas abrir novas circunvalaci ns crear equipamentos servizos p blicos e zonas verdes mellorar a calidade urbana ou reducir o chan urbanizable previsto en m is dun mill n de metros cadrados e en m is de 1
217908 tampouco responde cuesti n clave desta revisi n que non outra que adaptar o contido do plan a un informe absolutamente demoledor da conseller a de pol tica territorial que quen debe darlle a aprobaci n definitiva e que considera inaceptable a maior parte deste
217909 a estas alturas da tramitaci n hai que concretar e dicir que se vai facer cos chans urbanizables que a xunta declara inadmisibles deben aclarar se se suprimen modif canse ou mant ense pero con argumentos que ata agora non se co ecen
217910 they follow a procedure with a number of tests separated by 24 hours and each test has failed to show any improvement at all
217911 they have also accepted to donate the rest of his organs to save greek people
217912 his father humbled us all it is all we talk about here in athens this is not us not this savagery
217913 i saw doujons father and i was shocked because he is a real human forgive us
217914 our thoughts and prayers go to you and to your brave dad doujon condolences are simply not enough shame on all of us shame on greece
217915 as people as citizens as greeks we mourn the loss of a life and as we talk about greeces image abroad it is logical that these isolated incidents sadden us even more
217916 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time
217917 there was a fight between two families and we understand he was shot dead by a member of one of the families
217918 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
217919 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
217920 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
217921 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
217922 and if we wouldnt have sent him away he may well be alive and well amongst us at the moment
217923 in our view the slump in the economy is now occurring so rapidly that the rba should already be cutting rates
217924 however the rba is likely to take a more cautious approach leaving official rate cuts till later this year after a further rise in unemployment and when it becomes confident that inflation has peaked
217925 the problem though is that the longer interest rates are left at these levels the greater the risk of a serious recession
217926 the economy more generally is feeling the ongoing impacts of the reserve banks tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises
217927 inventories were run down significantly suggesting continuing weaker demand and the potential for further falls in production
217928 despite what most people might think of me surely they credit me with enough intelligence not to say something like that
217929 that would be just a blatant piece of stupidity im not that silly i hope
217930 perhaps in the future hell be more careful about what he chooses to say
217931 i have been erroneously accused because i didnt have any intention of saying anything that could develop into what it became
217932 i feel really embarrassed im very very disappointed about the whole thing
217933 i rang the woman and said you dont know me but i would just not say that to you it has been misconstrued
217934 after james and hutchy craig hutchison said thats a disgraceful thing to say for one second i had no idea what they were talking about i totally missed the ambiguity of it all
217935 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wreidt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
217936 they were clearly a crude double entendre designed to belittle the minister and to me it looked premeditated
217937 after the commitments from nines management that they take seriously conduct thats offensive to women todays response to me seems hollow
217938 they are completely unacceptable comments and channel nine needs to address this issue
217939 if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair

217943 with the cost of oil nearing 150 a barrel and gas pushing 5 a gallon in some parts of the country additives and gadgets to help conserve fuel are very tempting for cash strapped consumers
217944 unfortunately these devices and additives will only end up draining the drivers wallet without adding the much needed boost to their gas tank
217945 do you want to know right now how you can drive around using water as fuel and laugh at rising gas costs while reducing emissions and preventing global warming
217946 have discovered some little known products that can actually help you increase your fuel mileage 10 20 40 and possibly more
217947 these banks have a responsibility to act look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge
217948 in those days they were keen to get their rates down so that they could get some more lending business
217949 this time its different because the global money markets are still caught up in these american problems and the cost of money in those markets is still very high
217950 im not in the business of telling banks what to do i just think that competitive pressures will oblige them to pass on any reserve bank reduction
217951 industrialised nations are facing some of the most uncertain economic conditions in the past two decades with soaring energy and food prices combined with uncertainty in global credit markets
217952 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions

217954 no seremos una sociedad real hasta que tengamos igualdad entre hombres y mujeres

217959 we have a team working with bocog to unblock sites to make it easier for reporters and to remove any concerns that sites are censored
217960 apart from those sites for example which relate to pornography which is common to every country in the world to block and sites which could be considered subversive all other sites should be free to enable all reporters to properly report on the games as they have in previous games
217961 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
217962 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
217963 rogge said i want to assure you i have always kept you informed and we have not shifted anywhere on this and wouldnt have without your involvement
217964 i said im very pleased to hear that because i had big doubts this week the situation was very bad
217965 rogge said i want to give you an unequivocal assurance that i have not in any way deviated from our position that we require an uncensored internet
217966 i said if that is the case you had better put out a statement pretty quickly he said im here to tell you that theres no deal
217967 he said he was taken aback as much as anybody in the last few days that sites like the bbc deutsche welle amnesty international and so on were blocked
217968 there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one

217993 would expect that our recruitment levels would slow down quite dramatically in tough times

217996 when youve got average claim size increasing and premiums lag that profitability is lower at this part of the cycle

218292 i made the biggest mistake of my life and did some drugs with her father right before i went into labor unaware i was about to have her
218293 i get out and i have a child whos 1 its hard to adjust to being the mother
218294 i decided to get this over so she wouldnt remember
218295 if we prosecute pregnant women who use any kind of illicit substance we are opening the door to other prosecutions
218296 weve got a small community that has a very bad drug problem
218297 when a child is born and lives a few minutes because the mother was addicted to methamphetamine thats a very very serious crime here
218298 congratulations to larry kissell and gary peters for assembling true people powered campaigns for change and beginning the home stretch with an energized base of volunteers
218299 our mobilize for change a national day of action was a huge success with hundreds of thousands of doors knocked and phones dialed in the name of change all across america our candidates are inspiring voters to join their fights for a new direction and building their campaigns from the bottom up
218300 it is becoming increasingly hard for americans to find work in this economy
218301 as the construction manufacturing and now retail sectors are reeling from job losses too many workers are being forced to reduce their hours and take part time jobs just to make ends meet
218302 i think were going to see more of the same for at least another quarter and it could be the rest of the year
218303 its good to have the government adding jobs in the short term but thats not an long term solution either
218304 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans not boost the profits of oil companies
218305 its time to restore fairness and balance to our economy and we can start by passing the emergency economic plan that im proposing today
218306 unlike senator obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems
218307 there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses the american people cannot afford economic policies that will take us backward
218308 those who violate biblical teaching must show repentance and regret before we can share communion with them
218309 after the opening of the iron curtain and the internet revolution despite losses from the subprime debacle european and us investment firms are ramping up their global warming research trading desks investments strategies and capital

218323 is probably a good summary of how it will go over
218324 the behaviour of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
218325 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody any more thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
218326 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
218327 if it helps with the violence that i am seeing on the news every night then i guess that is a good thing but i kind of think people will find a way to get around it and maybe it will just cause more drinking on the street after the bars close
218328 i think its about time but it will be interesting to see how its going to be enforced

218331 to collaborate with the national parliaments in constructive partnership for the good of our nations and of the whole european union
218332 based on the complementary nature of the responsibilities of the european parliament and the national parliaments the objective of the european parliament is to develop overlapping networks in order to promote more parliamentary accountability and transparency and handle efficiently its links with national parliaments
218333 providing a platform for the electronic exchange of eu related information between parliaments in the union
218334 exchanging eu information among parliaments has become increasingly important during the past decade in order to facilitate the flow of information national parliaments in cooperation with the european parliament have created their own database and website
218335 the principle whereby the union does not take action except in the areas which fall within its exclusive competence unless it is more effective than action taken at national regional or local level
218336 since we decided in september last year 2006 to send commission legislative initiatives to national parliaments for screening the commission has received 76 opinions the commission welcomes this engagement by national legislatures and is committed to respond
218337 a reasoned opinion stating why it considers that the draft in question does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity
218338 national parliaments and the european parliament are not in competition but share the same objective to strengthen european democracy
218339 we will never be able to explain this whole project of european union better unless it is anchored within the national and even regional political traditions and party systems if they dont feel that this is a concern of theirs that this is something that matters to them i dont think that we will ever succeed
218340 it has to trickle down in the party systems and the local political traditions of every member state that is where the national parliaments come in they are very important and they also have to change the way they work on eu matters now there is often a european affairs committee that engages in eu issues and none of the others committees take an interest
218341 create a direct political relationship between national parliaments and european institutions including of course the commission
218342 it is a sign of the commissions commitment to developing relations with national parliaments that we nevertheless went ahead with measures in the spirit of the constitutional treaty to better associate national parliaments in may 2006 i announced the intention of the commission to transmit its new proposals and consultation papers to the national parliaments inviting them to react so as to improve the process of policy formulation
218343 our contacts with national parliaments suggest that they have found it useful in three ways providing an opportunity for national parliaments to take a more pro active attitude about european issues the right of information and leaving national parliaments better placed to scrutinize their own governments the interest of national parliaments in using this new mechanism is also a proof of your commitment to the european union
218344 rock band live brings together a terrific combination of artists for a night of rock n roll love
218345 the bands are fantastic the timing dovetails perfectly with the release of rock band 2 and the events will be tons of interactive fun for families
218346 it seems that evian natural spring water has been there all my life
218347 the diversity of talent in the american fashion industry is evident by the 28 new members who are now part of the cfda family the cfda is proud to count them within our ranks and we are committed to helping them as we are to all 350 members be more successful in business
218348 dianes unanimous election to a second two year term as cfda president is a great testament to the leadership she has demonstrated during her first term in the past two years the cfdas membership has increased and the overall visibility of the american fashion industry has risen new programs and direct benefits for members have been initiated dianes enthusiasm for and commitment to the cfda have been unwavering and i look forward to continuing my support of her efforts on behalf of all designers
218349 they sat very close together she only had eyes for him

218351 theyre on and off but its never really over between them
218352 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
218353 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
218354 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
218355 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

218359 p oliticizing the games was contrary to the worlds wishes for the olympics and would in the end undermine the olympic movement
218360 inevitable that people from different countries and regions might have different views
218361 s uch differences can only be overcome by dialog on the same level
218362 who wanted to ask about tibet or human rights were not given the opportunity to ask their questions
218363 s ome international olympic committee officials had cut a deal to let china block
218364 china had committed to providing the media with the same freedom to report on the games as they enjoyed at previous olympics but journalists have this week complained of finding access to sites deemed sensitive to its communist leadership blocked
218365 admits its new members at a ceremony during which they agree
218366 keep themselves free from any political or commercial influence and from any racial or religious consideration to fight against all other forms of discrimination and to promote in all circumstances the interests of the international olympic committee and those of the olympic movement
218367 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
218368 we believe the turnaround story is coming to fruition with benefits from improved demand cost cutting initiatives and a better pricing environment
218369 the current share price provides a potential 32 percent return to our revised target price of 56 well in excess of the 10 percent to 12 percent threshold we use for companies with a market capitalization of over 25 billion
218370 the current share price represents an attractive entry point as we expect barrick gold as the largest capitalization and largest producer in the sector to benefit from the expected fall gold rally in late third quarter and fourth quarter
218371 in the current environment of u s economic uncertainty and higher gold prices we believe that large capitalization highly liquid blue chip type gold equities such as barrick will benefit
218372 but a strong banana pricing environment and cost savings have outshined these challenges
218373 if melinda had any information nancy grace stopped the investigation in its track
218374 these cases underscore the importance of continued clinical vigilance so pml can be discovered and managed appropriately
218375 the changes primarily reflect an upward revision to our estimates for principal global investors to more appropriately take into account both asset growth and a return to greater profitability as securitization losses diminish
218376 with this new contrast medium we were able to visualize five to ten times more foci of inflammation in comparison to conventional mri images and contrast media
218377 ms is the most frequent cause of occupational disability and handicap in young adults
218378 new therapies have a positive influence on the course of the disease but are often not initiated at early stages since the diagnosis of ms is not yet established
218379 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
218380 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
218381 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
218382 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
218383 i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake
218384 its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day everyone else should just suck it up and get a good nights sleep
218385 it is possible that nano particles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry
218386 seven uncharged gold atoms form a triangle with an additional vertex
218387 uncharged gold atoms probably prefer this structure as it is easier for the electrons to avoid each other
218388 the clusters are rather unstable you cant just buy them as a powder
218389 this means we have to repeat the experiment with around 200 different wavelengths of the infrared laser
218390 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
218391 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
218392 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
218393 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
218394 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv
218395 it is difficult for me to continue i would have liked to sign with psg but i prefer not to take risks
218396 i would have liked to have been the paolo maldini of paris saint germain but sadly it will not be possible
218397 samuel has to have an agreement after this we will start negotiations but first he has to be happy
218398 we are waiting for this agreement if he moves itll be to a big club of course there are four or five clubs interested
218399 there is a personal experience but it moves away from being centered on the one machine
218400 all i need today is an internet connection and a web browser
218401 to get someone else to do it someone really big
218402 i want the person who is deserving of winning the heisman trophy to win the heisman trophy
218403 ive always said that im sure somebody else will win it twice so if this is the year and tim tebow deserves it ill be the first to congratulate him i dont cheer or hope for it not to happen
218404 but each and every year presents different challenges tebow has to be the front runner having won it last year and with the fact he is playing on an outstanding football team
218405 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
218406 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
218407 i may not have spoken out the way you want me to speak out
218408 the only way to solve the problems in this country is if we all come together black and white

218421 there was no multi century periods sic when global or hemispheric temperatures were the same or warmer than in the 20th century
218422 norse seafaring and colonization around the north atlantic at the end of the 9th century indicated that regional north atlantic climate was warmer during medieval times than during the cooler little ice age of the 15th 19th centuries

218439 are you are better off now than you were four years ago
218440 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
218441 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
218442 are you better off than you were four years ago is there more or less unemployment than there was four years ago
218443 ill say this to you the hummer is not driven on a regular basis

218454 what how could this be they just added the overnight shipping
218455 opened and noticed that this was not my correct order
218456 this is my last time doing a replacement make sure you get the order right this time or else youve lost a customer
218457 theres a saying up her that this is a great place to raise kids thats been violated and we dont know why
218458 this is a close knit community this is obviously a shock to everybody
218459 this is where people come to relax and get away from craziness
218460 out here people are talking about are you going to the convention they dont even ask which convention almost like minneapolis doesnt even exist
218461 just look at what barack obama has said as he was on his way back from europe
218462 theres a temptation there to help you draw crowds and everything but theres a downside to it it kind of feeds into the notion that youre somehow elitist or somehow in this exclusive club that is separated from the common man so to speak
218463 when i called over to the assembly i didnt find much interest in the bill
218464 affiliate marketing revenue grew 10 in the quarter which was in line with our expectations as commission junction continues to take market share
218465 i would love to have played at palmerston getting them in your own back yard is always going to be beneficial
218466 but uefa regulations state that there is no standing allowed
218467 however its the first time in history that we have played in europe and i think thats why it will be a sell out
218468 i think there will be great interest in the game from the general public as well as the people of dumfries
218469 and airdrie is a good ground so hopefully it will be full and there is a great atmosphere on the night
218470 i dont know anything about them we need to see what kind of team they are but i am assuming it will be a hard game
218471 i will try and get out to watch them there isnt a lot of time before the first game but they will be in the same position as us they will try to scramble over here to see us but thats part of being in europe
218472 its not often you get the chance to play in europe so we are going to make the most of it and enjoy it
218473 i dont think the founding fathers were multicultural multiculturalism is the antithesis of the motto
218474 if were going to move away from those principles we better consider the blessings of god that have been bestowed on this country and the protective hand of god thats been over this country
218475 religious freedom is a bedrock value of america it is one of our core tenents and yet here we have bill sali a united states congressman showing his disdain for people who belong to religions other than his own today bill sali is belittling hindus and muslims tomorrow will he do the same with roman catholics and buddists or perhaps jews and mormons either sali is too dumb and insentitive to realize that his words are extremely hurtful to others or he really is a religious bigot either way this man does not belong in the united states congress
218476 idaho has been unfairly characterized as being intolerant for too long having one of our congressmen make statements showing his religious and cultural intolerance only makes it more difficult to overcome that false perception
218477 my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead
218478 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
218479 i guess i just cant believe kids can be that destructive quite honestly
218480 i dont think having a mail slot through your front door is a good idea anymore
218481 i think the dangers outweigh the benefits with any type of mischief or arson attempt i think people should consider sealing the mailboxes
218482 ceased to exist as a band for the purpose of the indian act it does not however mean that the sinixt ceased to exist as a tribal group
218483 were talking about for all intents and purposes asserting a right to be consulted and to consent to all uses or dispositions of crown land within that territory
218484 if you or i had any intention of defrauding the government of a couple of million dollars wed be thrown in jail
218485 why arent the executives facing such charges for having defrauded the government of billions of dollars
218486 you didnt have to go very far to get an illegal carton of cigarettes for half the cost of what they would be selling at the retail level
218487 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
218488 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
218489 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
218490 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
218491 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
218492 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
218493 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
218494 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers
218495 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
218496 hey the difference between snapfish and tabblo is the difference between a 1970 chevy and a new hondo

218504 marys long history of working with gun violence prevention groups her knowledge of the issues and her willingness to work as a volunteer lobbyist in congress made her appear to be a good choice for states uniteds legislative director
218505 unlike the nra which obviously has plenty of money to spend paying spies for years at a time states united relies heavily on dedicated volunteers to accomplish the work of the organization
218506 it is beyond my comprehension how someone could have listened to my story and expressed desire to help prevent others from having to experience the agony i went through all the time collecting money as a gun lobby spy
218507 gun violence prevention groups shocked at years of deceit by mary
218508 forward this email to everyone and put your address at the bottom and aol will send you a check for 290 my sister in law did this last month and she just received her check yesterday
218509 not sure if anyone saw this today on good morning america

218511 the biggest variable will continue to be the buying patterns of our large base of u s customers
218512 we dont expect any growth in the u s until the second half of the fiscal year and we dont expect a lot
218513 growth around the world was offset by declines in the u s we have got a greater share of our business in the u s than most of our peers
218514 thumper grew billings 37 percent year over year in q4 this was driven by the popularity of zfs
218515 the fact that zfs is so popular is giving us the opportunity to bring out innovations in
218516 so thats probably the area we feel most confident about
218517 i think its pretty unfair to say that were the only company that has disappointed in the last six months
218518 we have a number of large customers in the u s and a number of these customers have been very publicly negatively impacted
218519 the mature economies of the world are probably most stressed in terms of their linkage to the u s economy
218520 people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
218521 it is difficult for me to continue i would have liked to sign with psg but i prefer not to take risks
218522 i would have liked to have been the paolo maldini of paris saint germain but sadly it will not be possible
218523 when i first got out of professional football i was like maybe ill do something other than football
218524 mike price i probably would have gotten more out of one year with mike than maybe 20 years with some other guys its just his approach hes detail oriented and hes firm with the players but at the same time he always keeps it in perceptive and everything is positive reinforcement with him i want to try and coach that way
218525 it probably goes back to ed donatell the current uw defensive coordinator who recruited dunn to idaho one time i was kind of struggling with an issue and he said youve just got to rely on your gut feeling with things sometimes in this business youre asked to do things that go again what you want to do so ive kind of held to that
218526 i knew him dunn was a coaching intern with the team in 2003 i knew his style i felt the fit was going to be a good one i think hes a good young coach
218527 as we were talking to him we looked over and see the guy laying in the brush and he just gave up from there

218538 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
218539 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still quite constrained there are no clear signs its improving
218540 governments could back themselves into a corner if they create political pressure to cut variable rates
218541 if funding costs have not declined the rational response from a bank would be to cut back on lending which would mean a further contractionary effect for the economy
218542 s o reas nas quais as pessoas t m muita curiosidade
218543 if you think youre going to have a bad day and be sad or you think youre in for a happy day trust these thoughts as your intuition is likely to be right
218544 if you think you can do a thing or you think you cant do a thing youre always right
218545 people are just as happy as they make up their minds to be
218546 the good news is that a great life is available to each and every one of us living well and making a difference do not require money fame or power living well is about taking time to live your own life on your own terms its about caring and sharing about loving and dancing and sharing a meal with a friend or with a stranger life is short give it your very best every day
218547 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
218548 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
218549 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
218550 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
218551 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
218552 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
218553 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
218554 this bill would do more to lower gas prices at the pump
218555 any change in production would send a powerful signal to markets
218556 this proposal includes some very good ideas to address our countrys many energy related challenges and while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
218557 i am hopeful this plan can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor the american people deserve a real debate with productive senate action on bipartisan proposals to help make energy more abundant secure and affordable for americas families and businesses
218558 the time it takes to ship a horse overseas begins from the time that animal leaves the barn to the time it plants its hoof in the soil of its new home adding a five to 15 hour van ride on top of the time in flight is not cost effective and causes additional stress on the animals being shipped
218559 a permanent mid atlantic animal import and export center could reduce the cost of shipment for horse owners and buyers and reduce the stress on transported horses thereby increasing the overall condition and productivity of animals shipped overseas
218560 due to their geographical location properties in rural or remote areas must take extra care with fire safety as fire fighters take longer to travel to the property
218561 our past record for attending incidents is normally exemplary on average in north wales it takes us just over nine minutes to attend a dwelling fire and i would have expected them to get to this fire in 25 minutes
218562 although thankfully in this instance the delay did not endanger life or property any further it does of course cause us concern

218565 die aktuelle b rgerdiskussion zeigt dass es hier keine einheitliche meinung gibt ich halte es daher f r wichtig die diskussion weiterzuf hren sie nicht vorschnell zu beenden und diese entwicklung offenzuhalten
218566 es w rde berhaupt keinen sinn machen fahrzeuge in den us markt zu pumpen nur um zu wachsen
218567 wachstum bleibt auf unserer agenda aber wir schauen im augenblick schon sehr genau wieviel sich mit welchem modell verdienen l sst

218574 with the support of the government the airport and local industry we can potentially re position darwin as a strategic transport hub into near asia
218575 i hate the gooks i will hate them as long as i live
218576 we do want to strengthen our local purchase not just in adelaide but also victoria
218577 but it is getting difficult because local supply is decreasing particularly with gm holden and ford cutting volumes
218578 that makes it more difficult to secure the volume but we have been asking the australian government to further support projects to strengthen suppliers in australia
218579 by the end of this year or at the beginning of next year
218580 the middle east is still booming the problem is the high australian dollar makes it more difficult
218581 there is not as much of an expansion of the domestic market which means you need to compete well which is what everyone is doing so we need to
218582 we need a focus point to make us different from other competitors
218583 the car business is a human experience where you can have a bad experience and never come back that is why were asking our dealers to work together toward a culture change
218584 would expect that our recruitment levels would slow down quite dramatically in tough times
218585 by actively managing that book rather than to benchmark its actually performed extraordinarily well over the last three four years
218586 we are now seeing real evidence of a slowdown in our sales pipeline
218587 when youve got average claim size increasing and premiums lag that profitability is lower at this part of the cycle
218588 but i am talking about profitability being lower rather than going into negative profitability and leading to increases in strain
218589 in our view the slump in the economy is now occurring so rapidly that the rba should already be cutting rates
218590 however the rba is likely to take a more cautious approach leaving official rate cuts till later this year after a further rise in unemployment and when it becomes confident that inflation has peaked
218591 the problem though is that the longer interest rates are left at these levels the greater the risk of a serious recession
218592 the economy more generally is feeling the ongoing impacts of the reserve banks tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises
218593 inventories were run down significantly suggesting continuing weaker demand and the potential for further falls in production
218594 by the end of this decade boomers will be well and truly transitioned out and xers will be in control
218595 we are reaching a tipping point in the transition but after 2010 it will be unusual to still see a boomer in power
218596 the difficulty of finding quality leaders has meant that leadership development is now top of the agenda for most boards
218597 globalisation is making the chief executives job ever more difficult but good leadership can contribute up to 40 per cent of profit growth
218598 in the current climate boards are under enormous pressure to move quickly and be seen to make credible appointments
218599 this need to speed up the decision puts real challenges on the concept of succession planning but it does mean there is a real impetus to ensure that succession planning is taken seriously on an ongoing basis
218600 the new chief executives need to produce a clear strategy within about six months of taking charge
218601 but they have the added advantage of usually not having any allegiance to the old ceo and can then move decisively before rebuilding
218602 the boomers should be mindful of how the ground is shifting and start planning their exit right now

218605 plagued by higher funding cost and ongoing fears of further writedowns the sector has now tumbled over 40 per cent since its 2007 november highs

218607 i charge that we the roma are the last ethnic minority in this country that the press is still allowed to freely denigrate
218608 clearly this is a very volatile market with strong negative sentiment but notwithstanding that this is a company with quality assets

218751 news of the week the mainstream media forgot to report
218752 but incredibly nearly every single item they post is based on and actually links to a mainstream media story they cite stories by the new york times the associated press cnn and many other mainstream media outlets as proof that the mainstream media isnt covering those stories
218753 indian agencies are involved in the communal pogrom by hindu extremists and want to fulfill their nefarious designs by patronizing fanatic groups
218754 this is being done to give a communal colour to the legitimate 60 year old struggle of kashmiris and portray it in an unfavourable light before the international community
218755 this is also a cover up of the massive violations of human rights by indian security forces and of the imperialist designs of india
218756 the israeli type economic blockade of kashmir is aimed at plunging kashmiris into poverty and hunger so that they surrender and renounce their legitimate rights
218757 it is because of these and other deplorable plans that kashmiris are being throttled and hindu extremists being given full support
218758 what is surprising is that peaceful protestors in kashmir are being greeted with bullets while violent communalists and arsonists in jammu are being encouraged
218759 indian leaders their agencies and communal elements must understand that kashmiris will neither surrender out of fatigue nor relinquish their legitimate rights but reposing faith and trust in god will remain firm on their stand which will open new avenues for them
218760 the rulers must also know that they may certainly harm national integrity by stoking communal violence but will be unable to snatch the legitimate rights from kashmiris he said
218761 though protests and peaceful demonstrations are an integral part of democratic process but when these are allowed to degenerate into communal fratricide and sectarian confrontation these can scuttle the sacred edifice of democracy itself jammu has to its credit their heart warming record of the nineties of last century when it proved to be a bastion of peace communal harmony and compassion
218762 it is rather distressing that some recent developments have been allowed to take communal trappings those who seem to be taking recourse to such retrograde steps are doing a great disservice to the fair name of jammu and its peace loving tolerant people
218763 the situation becomes more painful when minority groups living there feel unsafe and threatened
218764 the talk of economic blockade of kashmir valley makes the scenario even darker any person with a national vision or patriotic consideration can imagine the dangerous ramifications of such occurrences for the fragile internal peace within the state as well as its disastrous potential for the whole country
218765 nc in the interest of people of the state and broader interests of the nation appeals to all sane and patriotic people to settle the issues amicably and put an end to this conflict which can god forbid engulf the whole country

218797 he sets the table for everything that they do and they must have him in the fold to have any chance of succeeding this season
218798 there are definitely some similarities with jacksons current situation and larry johnsons circumstances a year ago
218799 both were entering the last year of their rookie contracts and had outperformed those original deals from a production standpoint as the focal point of their respective offenses they were in a position to hold the team hostage due to their value
218800 as one of the top three backs in the game he should be rewarded for the kind of production that he has and will continue to put up for them everyone else is taking a bite of the apple so it shouldnt come as a surprise that he wants to take his turn
218801 he will respond to their structured environment plus he is going to play with a chip on his shoulder after being let go in oakland
218802 he doesnt want to carry the load he works best when he has 15 or so carries and five or six receptions
218803 people forget that he was in the top five in rushing last season before his injury the biggest question regarding him is whether he can stay healthy
218804 but the unit as a whole is inexperienced and you wonder if their guys are tough enough to play a smash mouth style of game
218805 he has all of the tools to be an outstanding player
218806 but you wonder if he has the mindset and work ethic to make it happen

218829 when i went to detroit as the coach 15 years ago the team was really on the upswing
218830 looking at whats here for me and for the hawks its a challenge again i would say the biggest reason is to work with my son it doesnt happen often in sports but it is happening here its certainly an exciting day for myself and for the family
218831 its a dream come true for me when i first started it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside i wanted to get my career in motion over the last nine months here theres been a lot of changes everybody here senses a different atmosphere our team performed better that idea i had a long time ago kind of popped into my head again its a great day for everybody
218832 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit they understand the situation its an opportunity to come to chicago and be with stan the hawks think so much of him and so do i this is an exciting time for our family the timing could not be any better than it is today im thankful this came along at the right time im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be its really on its way

218839 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans

218872 the prospect of going to prison is very scary but the government is not listening to us and time is running out they are defending the corporations and profit rather than the needs of the citizens so i dont feel like i have a choice
218873 i have kids so of course this is not something that i take lightly at all but we are at a really crucial junction the threat from climate change is profoundly serious
218874 if that involves going to prison and i really really do not want to go then that is what i am prepared to do
218875 i think many more people will now follow in the footsteps of these five and be prepared to go prison to get the message about climate change across

218886 ich bin auf dem hungaroring immer sehr gut zurechtgekommen mir liegt diese strecke
218887 wir arbeiteten an verschiedenen setup optionen f r das auto
218888 ich probierte auch die neue motor abdeckung aus aber es ist schwierig diese in jedem detail zu bewerten
218889 unsere hauptgegner scheinen immer noch etwas schneller zu sein als wir
218890 die situation ist nicht allzu schlecht das auto l sst sich besser fahren aber unsere hauptgegner scheinen immer noch etwas schneller zu sein als wir selbst wenn es das bliche fragezeichen hinter den unterschieden bei der benzin menge gibt
218891 es gibt immer noch raum f r verbesserungen und wir werden alle anstrengungen auf die vorbereitung auf das qualifying und das rennen konzentrieren
218892 es ist schwer zu sagen wo wir im vergleich zum wettbewerb stehen aber klarerweise sind sie sehr schnell
218893 ich f hle mich auf dem weicheren reifen nicht allzu wohl w hrend die situation auf dem h rteren den ich zun chst verwendete viel besser war
218894 wie gew hnlich ist es am ersten tag auf dem hungaroring schwierig zu verstehen wie sich die reifen verhalten denn man hat immer eine menge graining w hrend sich die situation st ck f r st ck ver ndert wenn mehr gummi auf dem asphalt liegt
218895 wir wissen in welche richtung wir arbeiten m ssen und wir werden alles tun was wir tun k nnen um ein gutes ergebnis zu erzielen das wird schwierig werden aber ich bin gleichzeitig zuversichtlich
218896 die ergebnisse eines freitags sind immer schwierig zu bewerten da man nicht wei mit wie viel benzin die anderen teams fahren

218954 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
218955 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
218956 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
218957 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels

218985 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
218986 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
218987 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year

219007 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
219008 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
219009 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
219010 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
219011 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
219012 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
219013 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
219014 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop

219017 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
219018 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
219019 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
219020 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
219021 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
219022 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
219023 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
219024 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
219025 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
219026 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
219027 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
219028 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
219029 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
219030 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
219031 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
219032 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
219033 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
219034 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
219035 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
219036 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
219037 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
219038 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
219039 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
219040 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
219041 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling toward catholic unity

219051 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard

219105 complying with these requirements will be time consuming and inevitably will increase administrative and personnel costs on campuses

219139 cassie is what they call a watcher and that means that she can see the future but it comes in like flashes of seconds or minutes
219140 and whatever decision that anybody makes can change the future so shes always kind of trying to beat her power in a way and try to get to that future first before it changes it was really so much fun to play a true character and i felt thats what cassie was it was so fun to be a part of like the costume and everything
219141 shes very sarcastic and very dry and shes always like that
219142 thats just who she is and shes kind of trying to deal with being a 14 year old and also having this power and trying to find the balance between that and also trying to save her mom her mom is in danger and shes by herself in hong kong and i think its all very tough for her and shes trying to keep a strong face on

219147 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually
219148 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan

219152 heaven wont take marines and hell is afraid theyll take over
219153 this isnt golf we dont get a do over we cant let this president wage war and kill more people in violation of international law and violation of the geneva convention his conduct is in violation of the nuremberg principles we need to hold him to account and if we do that there wont be an attack on iran
219154 laura and i are having the time of our lives its going to be a perfect day im in a great mood
219155 i will not go away i will not turn off the camera we are in public are you worried perhaps about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact you know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out

219157 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911

219159 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
219160 this document does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against usama bin laden in a court of law
219161 and at this juncture we are able to perform professional no notice inspections all over iraq and to increase aerial surveillance

219163 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
219164 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
219165 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal
219166 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
219167 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
219168 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
219169 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

219178 it was scary wild everything went dark and the wind blew
219179 siberias capital for the first time became a tourist mecca

219184 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
219185 if its a multi party case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
219186 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
219187 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
219188 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
219189 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
219190 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
219191 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood
219192 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
219193 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
219194 were so overloaded by information bites that were less and less able to go deeply to create knowledge or wisdom out of all the information
219195 this is one reason why i say were on the cusp of a dark age
219196 but theyre ultimately times of cultural decline i think were defining our own dark age by skimming along on the surface of life and relationships and thoughts and its certainly a dark age when were faced with an ignorance born not out of a lack of information but out of an inability to create knowledge out of the information around us

219203 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations

219206 before the operation we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact hed have somebody elses hands
219207 when he woke up he looked at his hands and went very good
219208 already the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining
219209 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off

219211 if the oncologist focuses on the benefits of palliative chemotherapy in terms of control of symptoms and quality of life but omits information about survival benefit the patient might assume much greater potential to prolong life than is likely to be the case
219212 perhaps most difficult of all is when a patient or their partner or carer makes it clear that they do not want to receive any more bad news talking about life expectancy can seem cruel at this point
219213 but supplying basic information about the survival benefit of treatment need not entail giving intrusive data about prognosis
219214 la pace e la sicurezza che noi abbiamo scoperto in sud africa non possono nascere dalla canna di una pistola do tutto il mio supporto a questo gruppo e al suo progetto

219231 just because people live in public housing does not mean they can be cut off from political debate
219232 public housing tenants have exactly the same rights as everyone else to be involved in our democracy and housing authority officials violate the first amendment when they block political campaigning and registration efforts at their doorsteps
219233 moreover political campaigners also have a first amendment right to go door to door to disseminate their views in public housing developments just as they would in any other place
219234 door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people
219235 it substitutes the judgment of the community for the judgment of the individual householder
219236 the next washington bureau chief of the ap must preserve the authority and standards we have spent 160 years building while at the same time leading us into a new and rapidly changing world of journalism
219237 there are few places in all of journalism more respected or closely watched than the washington bureau of the associated press and there are few moments in history when the aps coverage of washington has mattered more
219238 the whole world really is watching washington and american politics

219246 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer

219252 this bipartisan bill helps reaffirm our commitment to trading partners and strengthen our existing trade preference programs
219253 these provisions will help create incentives for the purchase of u s goods supporting businesses and workers here at home while also providing valuable benefits to workers and companies abroad
219254 there has been a dramatic drop off in u s jeans orders since the itc issued its determination this month
219255 it became obvious that eliminating the provision was the only option at this point even african denim producers agreed because they started losing all of their business
219256 if the senate acts i think we could very well see some of the companies who had held back placing business think again about putting orders back into africa

219290 ritengo prosegue che far sapere a queste persone e anche far sapere a me che la televisione a cui abbiamo lavorato con tanto impegno per anni sta per diventare la tv personale di un oligarca che ci cambia il nome e ci manda il suo segretario a comunicare a mezzo repubblica e un mese fa lo stesso segretario che non sta nella pelle aveva abbozzato il racconto a mezzo espresso come sar il nostro palinsesto da qui a un mese sia una mancanza di tatto e anche una mancanza di intelligenza

219294 im extremely proud of the team and what theyve accomplished in the classroom
219295 it means even more that they won a conference regular season title and tournament championship
219296 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
219297 they the police said that now the bloke has died theyve got enough cases dealing with live people to chase up that they just havent got the manpower to deal with it
219298 they were concerned that possible evidence was going to be allowed to be destroyed
219299 the officers acted in the way they felt was best at the time other people have looked at their decision and made a different one

219303 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
219304 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
219305 i believe we are now on the way to getting there

219318 in a sample of men who slew their preschool age children 82 percent of the victims of stepfathers were beaten to death
219319 present analyses are based on a case by case data archive of all homicides known to have occurred in canada from 1974 to 1990
219320 homicide risk from stepfathers was approximately 60 times higher than from genetic fathers for this age group replicating the immense differential found in prior analyses daly and wilson 1988a b
219321 whereas a stepfather was about 60 times more likely to kill his preschool child than a genetic father this contrast does not apply to all means of killing in particular a stepfather was not demonstrably more likely than a genetic father to shoot a child but he was 120 times more likely to beat one to death more specifically stepfathers who killed small children were far more likely than homicidal genetic fathers to have beaten their victims to death

219333 my reference to the rosenberg case a national tragedy was not intend to suggest death would be the result of the case against the mayor as it was in the rosenberg case mr
219334 a review of the history of this terrible injustice will demonstrate that the media convicted the rosenbergs in the court of public opinion before they were charged
219335 moreover instead of reporting the facts the press has been clear in its condemnation of the mayor and its belief in his guilt

219346 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race

219352 i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
219353 as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface
219354 the upshift is better with the new gearbox and obviously a good step forward but unfortunately for us we are not going to use it tomorrow and sunday we are struggling with the grip level at the moment as there is a lot of inconsistency and the balance is not quite there over the day the track conditions did improve a lot and the last 10 to 15 minutes of the second session were much better lets see for tomorrow and how it improves again as we use it more
219355 it was good to use the seamless shift box on both cars today and we ran without any problems
219356 we also ran some updated parts for the high downforce configuration and didnt have any mechanical issues we are just trying to understand the tyres
219357 obviously the track evolves throughout the day and the event and was very dirty to start with which caused a lot of graining on the tyres overall we got through our whole programme of work and i think we can have a good weekend
219358 for tomorrow well be reverting back to the standard gearbox configuration as its the fourth race of this boxs cycle but well be using the seamless shift in valencia
219359 the upshift is better with the new gearbox and obviously a good step forward but unfortunately for us we are not going to use it tomorrow and sunday
219360 we are struggling with the grip level at the moment as there is a lot of inconsistency and the balance is not quite there
219361 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
219362 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
219363 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
219364 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
219365 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
219366 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
219367 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
219368 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
219369 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
219370 verdade que muitas pessoas t m a sensa o de que a vida se tornou mais dif cil desde o ano passado
219371 formei um governo que vai permitir aos japoneses colher os frutos da reforma
219372 n o penso que seja o momento de discutir uma dissolu o
219373 o alckmin vai ter um problema s rio porque ele n o vai representar nem o governo atual de serra jos serra governador e kassab e nem o passado ele certamente vai tentar o tempo todo mostrar alguns defeitos e capitalizar quest es do governo que est sendo muito bem avaliado
219374 natural que na televis o kassab consiga alcan ar pelo menos 70 da boa avalia o do governo n o tem candidato que n o tenha 70 de sua avalia o a nossa expectativa de que ele rapidamente chegue a 20 das inten es de voto
219375 isso o que eles querem porque sabem que o governo do kassab bem avaliado
219376 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
219377 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
219378 according to the most recent data made available by the market research firm netapplications today internet explorer stands at 69
219379 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
219380 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
219381 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
219382 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
219383 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past
219384 average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0 75 percent at fatalities in iraq will reach 4 300 or more
219385 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
219386 sit down youll have a chance to ask your questions but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous
219387 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
219388 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
219389 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
219390 i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois so these are issues ive worked on for decades
219391 now that doesnt mean that im going always satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed which gives you the option of voting for somebody else it gives you the option to run for office yourself
219392 the only way that were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asians and native american young old disabled gay straight
219393 now to inject this race card issue you know it takes it one step beyond that
219394 i will not allow anyone in this campaign to attack on race and its never happened before and it never will again and we are not going to allow the obama campaign to put this on the table
219395 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name

219397 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried and so i am quite satisfied with the days work the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
219398 it was a very productive first day here in hungary on this circuit where qualifying is particularly important its no secret that our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive our main focus was to understand the tyres and in particular the effect of graining all in all it was a successful day for us

219413 the governments tax stimulus package which put billions of dollars into consumers pockets led to only a modest rise in consumer spending and many businesses were caught off guard by the slowdown in sales

219508 gotten caught in what could be the biggest auditing scandal in the history of this town and im not exaggerating here i will guarantee you as auditors around the country learn about this theyre going to have disbelief and raw anger that this agency has impugned the integrity of government auditors everywhere by these kinds of irresponsible actions
219509 dcaa audits allegations that certain audits at three locations did not meet professional standards were substantiated
219510 w e also found that contractor officials and the dod contracting community improperly influenced the audit scope conclusions and opinions of some audits a serious independence issue
219511 we noted a pattern of frequent management actions that served to intimidate the auditors and create an abusive environment as a result some auditors were hesitant to speak to us
219512 demonstrates that the governments system of contractor oversight is rotten because the independent government agencies that are supposed to look out for the taxpayers are corrupted
219513 we have senior members inside the dcaa who are retaliating against their own members in favor of the private contractors
219514 you know the department of defense has been on the high risk list of this government for more than a decade scandal after scandal has rolled out of the department of defense on contracting i took a trip to iraq just on contract oversight with an auditors eye meeting with the people that oversee the contracts in iraq i think we burned up more than 150 billion in just pure contracting abuse

219574 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
219575 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
219576 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

219583 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

219614 this will be my last blog until we arrive in beijing
219615 its a beautiful day certainly the weather isnt causing this delay
219616 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
219617 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
219618 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
219619 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
219620 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
219621 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
219622 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
219623 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
219624 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
219625 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
219626 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
219627 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
219628 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
219629 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
219630 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
219631 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
219632 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
219633 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
219634 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
219635 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
219636 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
219637 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
219638 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
219639 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
219640 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
219641 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
219642 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
219643 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
219644 who are open to doing something on the production side
219645 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
219646 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
219647 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
219648 a lot people in this industry have speculated that older people dont fast forward through programming as much because theyre not tech savvy or they believe early adopters are uber tivo users and never watch live tv or commercials
219649 what this data shows is that none of that is true people are fast forwarding and time shifting on an overall basis in the same amounts but what they time shift is really different
219650 the people who invented tivo always anticipated bringing back viewership data from the box and using it
219651 only a few years ago did it get into that
219652 i would like to recognize john lowrys important contributions to catalent over the last seven years and particularly the leadership continuity and focus he brought during our transition to a standalone company i am also pleased to assume an even more active role during this transition to help drive catalents future success
219653 cest une immense victoire pour nous aujourdhui nous souhaitons maintenant aller de lavant avec la poursuite pour harc lement sexuel
219654 i used reflection to invoke some method and it threw an exception see the inner exception for details
219655 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
219656 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
219657 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
219658 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
219659 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
219660 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
219661 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
219662 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
219663 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
219664 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
219665 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
219666 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
219667 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
219668 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
219669 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
219670 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
219671 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
219672 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
219673 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
219674 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
219675 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
219676 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
219677 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
219678 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
219679 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
219680 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
219681 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
219682 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
219683 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
219684 i think he just told him to get out of his face
219685 just kept standing there and standing there he wouldnt move
219686 somebody stepped between us we were in one anothers faces i didnt swing at him i didnt punch at him it was just a vigorous discussion
219687 when you talk about inflation rates going up people are saying they cut down on bigger entertainment avenues like holidays eating out etc
219688 movies is what they are calling a three hour holiday these are called rejuvenation centres
219689 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
219690 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
219691 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
219692 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
219693 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
219694 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
219695 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
219696 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
219697 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
219698 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
219699 who wouldve thought that wed be celebrating because gas is 3 89 a gallon
219700 thieves are not only exposing themselves to the risk of serious and fatal injuries but they are also leaving the properties in an extremely dangerous condition with potentially fatal consequences for the owners
219701 herbivorous and carnivorous humans will never understand each others eating habits

219714 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
219715 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
219716 like many others i have been disappointed by the rank irresponsibility of some of the tabloid coverage
219717 holidaymakers do believe what they read but i also credit them with a little more perspective than some of the reports have shown
219718 many tour operators like us were simply not aware of any problems with crime for a good reason it never happens in tourist areas except for very minor petty incidents this tragic murder is a one off
219719 antigua and barbuda murder rate higher than in new york
219720 i have been working at the cto for five years and this is the first time i have had to answer questions about an incident like this she said all i can say is that we are shocked and stunned we take the security of visitors very seriously and are unhappy with some of the coverage i feel that some of the articles could have been more balanced
219721 our very brand is based on people being safe in antigua and barbuda
219722 more than 280 criminals have been deported back to our 108 square mile island during the past 10 years
219723 to any small island developing state this figure is astronomically high in many cases the only connection was the fact that they were born here
219724 i would have sacked him i think hes been grossly disloyal
219725 we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
219726 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
219727 we have got to take the right decisions it is very difficult in a downturn for leaders right around the world
219728 you are the sort of person we need as prime minister
219729 it is the prosecution case that although these defendants may not have been the masterminds of the plan that lay behind the london bombings they shared the same beliefs and motivation as the london bombers and so willingly and knowingly agreed to assist them in their preparations by carrying out a hostile reconnaissance
219730 this man is no bomber he was a friend of the bombers but someone who was in complete ignorance as to their intentions
219731 nowhere in scripture is homosexual practice affirmed or presented as a legitimate alternative to heterosexual relationships
219732 your love for me was wonderful more wonderful than that of women
219733 wherever you go i will go and wherever you stay i will stay may the lord deal with me very severely if anything but death separates you and me
219734 its a compliment to us and a challenge to us
219735 we think were in position to have a very good year
219736 but its all speculation its been 20 years now since these same polls came out when i was a junior quarterback at northwestern we were picked fifth we went unbeaten in the conference won the championship and went to the playoff quarterfinals
219737 we are in a very very competitive conference and it comes down to us doing our jobs well week after week to put together the season we want to have theres not a gimme theres no weak link you play well or you lose these guys understand that now we have to go do that
219738 patience is one of the characteristics of monastic life but even the patience of the brothers was tested by our slow internet
219739 broadband access has made a huge difference to our internet usage
219740 we knew we needed a faster connection but we had almost given up trying to find a workable solution which would give us an internet connection at speeds enjoyed by others on the mainland
219741 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
219742 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly
219743 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
219744 the incident was very tragic but was an isolated event
219745 bus travel has been and remains the safest mode of travel in the country
219746 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
219747 certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
219748 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
219749 we have some of the big names of european football coming in at this stage so it takes on a more traditional feel
219750 weve seen representatives from aston villa besiktas and deportivo la coruna here and of course some big names from the premier league were here for the champions league draw earlier as well
219751 midtjylland had a great result in the last round and looked a decent side from the highlights i have seen
219752 but ive no doubt that mark hughes and his staff will have the players ready for the challenge
219753 hopefully they will display the same level of professionalism the team showed against eb streymur and we can progress to the next round
219754 we are excited just to be in the draw first of all
219755 we had two tough games against odense and now we are determined to do as well as possible
219756 the fans showed last week they have an appetite for european football and i am sure they will back us against hafnarfjardar
219757 england and mike so that takes care of the men what about the women of wales scotland all welsh men are british all scottish men are british british men are not all scots and irish ok point taken but still no one called christian bale british so im still a
219758 the next game in the doom universe is in development
219759 we do have the core of the team working on it under the direction of kevin cloud
219760 we are working on what the story is going to be for the game right now the logo shown during quakecon didn t have a four or a subtitle we haven t made the decision about that yet there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one
219761 theres going to be big guns lots of blood and demons
219762 that s what we see as the core and that s what that game is about
219763 we are still working on the game and what it s going to be about
219764 the goal for the game is that it will be the best game of its ilk when its released
219765 it will remain true to what doom is about this very visceral experience but we still want to obviously be innovative within that
219766 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
219767 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
219768 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
219769 alicia and jocelyn are so much alike with their outgoing personalities and athletic accomplishments at ualr that they will have instant credibility when they are out recruiting and when they are coaching our players
219770 alicia and jocelyn will bring credibility on and off the court

219778 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
219779 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
219780 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
219781 with the growing cost of motoring and the pressure of having a greener lifestyle many motorists are considering alternatives and the electric car is an attractive option
219782 it is very cheap to run and youll never be stung at the petrol pump again
219783 consumers should consider the amount of cover provided by their insurer for contents kept in the garden
219784 the cost to replace some of the items kept in the garden for example following a theft could run into hundreds of pounds
219785 house prices are expected to see a modest correction but in the absence of forced sellers in the market place they do not anticipate a major collapse in property values

219787 flirting is just one more device divas deploy to get what they want behind the wheel
219788 a very specific definition of prime for the purposes of uk covered bonds
219789 covered bond investors are used to dealing with very commoditised and homogeneous instruments and the uk covered bond market currently allows too much leeway in terms of mortgage quality and structure
219790 modern tyres are very robust and failure resistant but older tyres that have been stored incorrectly or simply not used for many years can become unfit for purpose through the passage of time alone
219791 the community has created a great opportunity here but the lack of a central accessible location for the london lgbt community means that the average citizen has little opportunity to inform or take part in the crucial process of social change
219792 we are talking about a creative space where the community can gain support stay informed and take part in community action
219793 lesbian gay bi sexual and transgender residents workers and visitors are an important and valued part of the soho community and we know the concept of a

219795 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
219796 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
219797 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
219798 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
219799 whether its a file or an e mail if youre worried about it you
219800 the reason we discovered this is because they were on the job they look for it
219801 every day computers in university systems are subject to constant battering from external sources who are trying to get in security is a constant issue
219802 this is an issue of constant examination and its one that we have to always be wary of
219803 itd be remiss to say that we dont enjoy playing on the other systems and we have a lot of respect for the work that miyamoto san and nintendo do
219804 but i think its a logical extension of our gamercard gamertag and achievements
219805 people want to personalize their gamertag and so when we look to the future and think about building a brand new xbox experience avatars is a logical extension of that innovation i think its another avenue of self expression and there are a lot of opportunities here for consumers
219806 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways

219808 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
219809 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
219810 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
219811 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
219812 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
219813 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
219814 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company

219820 when you talk about yourself all the time of course people are going to keep doing it for you when youre not around

219823 the asian tigers are certainly increasing their profile significantly and quickly in the patent area
219824 that is a shift that is occurring in the balance of technological power around the world
219825 its been a long time i thought we were forgotten
219826 they talk about it all the time and there was some sign of relief that the individual is no longer with us
219827 just fatigue some stress lots of stress man headaches just constant everyday it just never ends
219828 phyiscally i look good but mentally you just talk to me right now about anthrax and my whole world is itching me
219829 with all this money and attention focused on teens the teen years are viewed as some sort of vacation
219830 our ceiling for students is really much closer to where the floor ought to be
219831 its almost gotten to the point that people expect less of teenagers than they do of toddlers think about it why do babies with inferior motor skills reasoning ability and physical strength experience nearly 100 percent success in overcoming difficult challenges while teens often falter well one is expected and the other is not why does every healthy baby learn to walk while very few teenagers have learned to dance why does every healthy baby overcome communication barriers by learning to talk while very few teenagers overcome barriers between themselves and their parents by learning to communicate one is expected and the other is not the truth is that all of us are susceptible to low expectations once we have satisfied the minimum requirements we tend to stop pushing ourselves
219832 dont let anyone look down on you because you are young but set an example for believers in speech in life in love in faith and in purity
219833 brothers stop thinking like children in regard to evil be infants but in your thinking be adults
219834 everyone has a talent what is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it
219835 there are two types of people the ones who say the pee in their wet suit and those that lie about it but thats another story
219836 we were having a conversation and myles was somewhere i knew he was safe so i relaxed for a second
219837 we ripped off myles clothes and called emergency and they said to put him under the shower but it seemed like forever until the ambulance arrived
219838 his eyes rolled into the back of his head because the pain was too much for him
219839 if parents take their eye off the ball even for a few seconds particularly with toddlers just learning to walk it can be a life changing event
219840 it was a bit of a bun fight we had these double doors that led from the sitting room to the dining room and that was the childrens play room
219841 john wanted to work on this set of nudes and he had the model for ages which was very expensive for us and we werent even sure they would sell but he wanted to redefine the genre of the nude
219842 traditionally the nude is a beautiful lady in a beautiful pose and john wanted to rephrase it into something more valid
219843 a middle aged woman not particularly attractive of very slender proportions and with short cropped hair a woman who appeared particularly incongruous and out of place like a naked housewife in the artists somewhat spartan north balwyn suburban living room
219844 its like a raw acid it gives you an electric jolt when you see it
219845 auctions are key indicators of the market and a lot has happened since the last lot of auctions three months ago
219846 certainly its not getting easier to consign stock and we are concerned about how the market is going to pan out over the next year
219847 a deep anxiety because people do want to know moral rules to live by
219848 the ability to act on the basis of own considered will
219849 few people who survived auschwitz continued to believe in the all powerful all good heavenly father or the scriptures
219850 therefore clive hamilton seems to pick up this challenge ignore the illusions of secular prosperity and lead us to something different who would not see some value in it
219851 i think the environmental urgency he responds to forces us to new thinking about the mysteries of existence
219852 its not very fashionable to espouse religious views so hes espousing a non spiritual spirituality which leaves everyone feeling somewhat confused he didnt know the solution it seems to be to charge up with some communal force but he doesnt say what it is or what it means
219853 its the idea of the classic philosophers life where you set yourself up as critical of modern life
219854 the big issue for me is this is all about morals and has political implications that are not spelled out
219855 i dont want someone deciding political implications on the basis of their own morals which would impinge on my freedom
219856 what i would endorse is that clive hamilton is resonating with a very ancient religious and philosophical tradition
219857 the metal masters judas priest heaven and hell motorhead testament
219858 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
219859 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
219860 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
219861 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
219862 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
219863 you simply cannot conserve marine resources successfully without talking to local communities
219864 people use these resources intensively their lives depend on them it is just not possible to conserve without looking at what problems the communities face
219865 madagascars conservation areas have traditionally been in wilderness regions with small human populations
219866 now with a push towards creating so many more protected areas they are increasingly going to be in places where they affect far greater numbers of people this calls for a whole new approach to the management of protected areas
219867 the people who live and work in an area feel it is their territory
219868 they do not they cannot be told by others what to do using a top down approach just creates problems it is better to start from the bottom and work upwards
219869 some villages are aware that resource degradation is a serious problem and they want to solve it but in some areas this is not the case we can guide and give advice but its not our role to impose marine parks or ban fishing in an area
219870 there are many problems here but first we need to help reduce fishing
219871 but to do that people need other work they need other jobs so they dont need to fish
219872 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
219873 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
219874 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
219875 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
219876 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
219877 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
219878 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and i will assume that it is likely to be in the new year
219879 sweetheart not long to go now and im going to really really miss you a lot
219880 the internet is an irrelevant academic toy real networking must be done with a solid formal model
219881 osi got it wrong by ignoring the internet the only proof of concept that what they were standardising was even possible the best we can hope for is that it fails before doing too much damage

219884 theyre afraid of saying theyre taking part in an aids conference

219886 he was the first patient with aids in my town he was a soldier who had served in africa
219887 we demonstrate on the streets to ask for medicines but our meetings are set up by word of mouth

219945 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
219946 we hope amnesty can take off the tinted glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
219947 we welcome the iocs recognition of its role on human rights but given the current reality we are surprised at their confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship
219948 the disgusting actions of this small group of anti chinese lawmakers
219949 fully exposed their evil motives to politicize the olympics and interrupt and sabotage the beijing olympics
219950 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the us side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti china hostile forces
219951 anti china splittism activities and hostile sabotage activities under the banner of so called human rights and religion
219952 this type of censorship would have been unthinkable in athens but china seems to have more formalities
219953 if journalists cannot fully access the internet here it will definitely be a problem
219954 my preoccupation and responsibility is to ensure that the games competitions are reported openly to the world
219955 the regulatory changes we negotiated with bocog beijing olympic games and which required chinese legislative changes were to do with reporting on the games this didnt necessarily extend to free access and reporting on everything that relates to china
219956 he has a lot of friends and they all are very upset hes gone and they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
219957 r i p tim mclean you are loved and you will be missed dearly
219958 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
219959 the attacker was over top of the victim amp continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
219960 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
219961 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
219962 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened
219963 if theres one thing in my life thats missing its the time i spend alone sailing on the clear and bright clear water its kind of a special feeling okay ill stop but it has been a favorite for decades even if i was about 4 when it came out

219965 minister finley has been a tireless proponent of an exit package for tobacco farmers
219966 as such the conservative government has been committed to finding a responsible solution ive said it before and i will say it again the conservative government is committed to putting farmers first
219967 through our work with the ontario flue cured tobacco growers marketing board our government has produced real results and shown our commitment to farmers
219968 tobacco producers and their families will be able to bring closure to what has been a very stressful time this program is available to help producers exit the industry transition to other crops or find new opportunities outside agriculture
219969 this is not only a win for farmers its a win for all tobacco affected communities
219970 since the community task force was established by minister ritz we have been working with mayors and community leaders and the task force to find solutions that will address the long term impact this challenging year has had on local communities
219971 2008 convergence conference the future of latin entertainment media and technology markets
219972 the lmec conference highlights what the administration is doing to make new york the capital of latin media and entertainment
219973 by bringing together industry investors educational institutions and government were developing an infrastructure that will retain expand and attract latin media and entertainment hispanic advertising and new media increase tourism and make new york a destination to experience the best of latin culture at our lmec events and develop the media and entertainment workforce
219974 it is an honor to partner with the new york latin media and entertainment commission and to attract such prominent and caliber of speakers to our conference
219975 i believe our conference is an opportunity for new york to continue to attract industry and for all attendees to learn first hand how to tap into the fastest growing market in the nation
219976 for the past few years latinvision has achieved bringing together top level hispanic executives and entrepreneurs creating an exceptional forum that gathers the smartest business minds around the area
219977 la ministre finley a toujours t une fervente partisane dun programme de retrait pour les producteurs de tabac a d clar le ministre ritz ainsi le gouvernement conservateur est r solu trouver une solution responsable je lai d j dit et je le r p te encore le gouvernement conservateur est d termin donner la priorit aux agriculteurs
219978 en collaboration avec la commission ontarienne de commercialisation du tabac jaune le gouvernement actuel est arriv des r sultats concrets et il d montre son engagement envers les agriculteurs a affirm la ministre finley les producteurs de tabac et leurs familles pourront mettre un terme une p riode qui a t tr s difficile ce programme vise aider les producteurs se retirer de lindustrie passer dautres types de cultures ou trouver des d bouch s lext rieur de lagriculture
219979 cette aide est un avantage non seulement pour les producteurs mais galement pour toutes les collectivit s touch es par la situation particuli re du tabac a soulign le d put preston depuis que le groupe de travail sur la collectivit a t fond e par le ministre ritz nous travaillons en collaboration avec les maires les dirigeants des collectivit s et les membres du groupe de travail pour trouver des solutions qui permettront de faire face aux r percussions long terme que cette ann e prouvante a eu sur les collectivit s locales

219982 the hr leaders and cios i talk to are having a hard time finding the talent that they need
219983 theyre looking for some people with business expertise or competence who are keeping their skills relevant theyre hungry for good talent and it would be best to learn as much of the business as you can it increases your value tenfold
219984 youre going to need to have that business expertise so if i was an 18 year old going into college i would be marrying my cs degree with a business degree
219985 a perfect example of why the american notion of a free public education is a bad idea hes nothing more than a wad of protoplasm a deadhead that one i should have failed him but that would have meant another semester reading his bloated prolixity so i promoted him im so ashamed
219986 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
219987 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation
219988 would you please stop calling and for the last time i am not your therapist

219991 today the commission tells comcast to stop and allow everyone to have unfettered access to the internet
219992 our action today is not about regulating the internet network neutrality rules are unnecessary because the commission already has the tools to enforce open standards
219993 my approach was that comcast issue was a review of one complaint and not a monumental decision
219994 this mediation is the best way to solve the problem
219995 the fcc doesnt know what comcast did or did not do
