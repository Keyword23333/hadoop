6610043 art music and activism dont have to be mutually exclusive
6610044 you dont have to just go onstage and preach and hope that people go out and do something
6610045 we want to get people active as well as get people to talk with each other we want there to be some productive conversations and some good things happening in general
6610046 all working on the same basic premise theyre not working on it in the same exact ways were all out there for the same reason
6610047 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6610048 a type of stew widely eaten in west africa including ghana liberia sierra leone and nigeria the word palaver comes from the portuguese language and means a talk lengthy debate or quarrel it is unclear how this led to the name of the stew one theory is that when the stew was first made with long ropey greens people would start quarrels by slapping each other with the greens from their stew

6610053 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6610054 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6610055 and if you would count the graces of allah never could you be able to count them
6610056 he has completed and perfected his graces upon you both apparent i e islamic monotheism and the lawful pleasures of this world including health good looks etc and hidden i e ones faith in allah guidance for doing righteous deeds and also the pleasures and delights of the hereafter in paradise etc
6610057 then which of the blessings of your lord will you both jinns and men deny
6610058 and also in your ownselves are signs will you not then see

6610064 our goal is to put on the best convention possible to put our best foot forward
6610065 they said that if you are already a member of the black chamber you automatically were considered a preferred vendor and would be listed
6610066 no one ever asked for a list of our members apparently they made no effort to be inclusive
6610067 we were looking at providing a mobile registration solution for the republican national committee to speed up the delegate check in process i called three or four times within a two week period but never got a call back
6610068 i sincerely hope there is still interest in using my work
6610069 please let me know the next steps that i can take to bring this to fruition
6610070 there is no excuse that this consideration of her publication didnt happen
6610071 both convention bureaus people talked about getting on this preferred businesses list
6610072 i think they had that big meeting to show people hey we reached out to the community now its up to them what they do with it
6610073 as far as i was concerned it was a way to get people to pay 425 to become a member of the different convention and visitors bureaus
6610074 if they really wanted diversity you can go to the black pages and find restaurants
6610075 you can work with those communities of color but you have to have someone dedicated to making sure that they do that
6610076 just dont do it by having a meeting and saying come to me at this certain time you actually have to do some outreach
6610077 if your goal is to make an outreach to a particular segment hispanic asian black and your goal is to reach out to that segment then the onus is on you
6610078 but if i want to say that i am mightier than god sit back and whoever comes to me maybe we throw some business their way if thats the attitude chances are there are not going to be a lot of minority owned businesses that are going to come to you
6610079 to try to get to the power players of the republican national convention
6610080 thats not right we should have diversity in everything we the republican party do
6610081 from blacks who are coming from out of town to the convention wanting to know where can they go to get their hair done where to go to get some soul food where can they go to church where can they find beauty products or where can they find places of special interest to them
6610082 it never occurred to them that somebody might need something different from the mainstream
6610083 we will be in the position to direct people looking for different cultures et cetera
6610084 i think lots of people will be visiting the twin cities because of the convention but may not necessarily be on the convention floor
6610085 the convention opens on a monday and some people will come for the weekend beforehand or they will stay after the convention ends and use this as part of their vacation i also think that not only the delegates will be coming but they might bring their families who wont be at the convention but will be out in the community wanting to spend money
6610086 my hope is that black businesses in our community will see that type of benefit
6610087 we are going to see when this is all over with just how much money they brought to the black community
6610088 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed

6610092 since late april or the beginning of may weve cleaned up graffiti on lake street from the target store at the minnehaha mall to west river road two or three times
6610093 about a year and half ago we started a huge mural project to get the whole community involved especially at risk kids
6610094 were getting to the point where almost every alley in our neighborhood has been covered
6610095 taggers want a big open space and a mural takes that away plus i think the gangs who are responsible for a lot of the graffiti tend to respect work that comes from the community
6610096 we did a great mural project a few saturdays ago
6610097 near lake street and longfellow avenue where most of our volunteers were latino kids that lived on the block
6610098 people see us on the street and ask to be put on
6610099 the corcoran mural project was awarded with council member gary schiffs neighborhood project of the year this february

6610187 in total the profits were rm20 77bil the government must explain these figures and why such huge profits have been agreed at the expense of the rakyat any profit should be passed down to the people in the form of reduced tolls gobind said
6610188 however a week earlier the deputy minister told parliament that the ministry had made a decision that the agreements could be made public there is a very serious contradiction here he said
6610189 the minister should encourage transparency and forward me copies of the toll concession agreements the rakyat demands to know why they are paying high toll rates when the highway concessionaries are reaping billions in profits gobind said
6610190 instead of looking at ways to reduce the burden of the residents the government is only causing more hardship we ask for the agreements to see if there are ways the toll collection could be reduced this is a genuine call by the residents to help resolve a big problem gobind said
6610191 however we hope it would not come to that stage as the relevant parties could come together for the benefit of the residents he said
6610192 my toll expenses alone are more than rm600 since most of us are middle class earners the government should implement a one way toll collection or alternatively make toll payments more affordable said toh

6610298 i would also like to briefly acknowledge that less than a year ago the events at ruatoki provided a fresh point of tension in our relationship it would not be appropriate or helpful for me to comment on the merits of the events of last october i know emotions are still raw and opinions strongly held but i am very pleased that less than a year later we are able to join together to show that it is the future that is first and foremost on the minds of ngai tuhoe
6610299 i think the tricky issues are around tuhoes desire and wish to have te urewera national park regarded as part of our territory the second one that would be difficult for the crown would be discussions over self government over mana motuhake and sovereignty

6610301 to help ensure that revealing what police found relating to the terrorism charges will not influence those firearms cases we removed the names from the material
6610302 police needed to treat what was happening in te urewera seriously and needed to investigate to do anything less would have been to fail in their duty to protect new zealanders we believe that the police were right to act however we also believe the public has the right to make its own judgment on the polices credibility and to do that it needs as much information as possible within the bounds of the law and within the bounds of fairness to all those involved that is why we decided to publish

6610320 el puerto es uno de los mejores del mundo en cuanto a infraestructura no obstante los buques avanzados mantiene un flujo de carga que aumenta cada vez m s por las condiciones de almacenamiento que presentan
6610321 los nuevos contenedores tienen la capacidad de refrigerar durante el viaje por mar e incluso por tierra y larga distancias
6610322 en este puerto se construyeron muchos almacenes a la orilla de los muelles para que la mercanc a se descargara de la bodega del barco y se protegiera en esos dep sitos en corto tiempo
6610323 lo que era tra do antes en 100 barcos de bodega ahora se transporta en 1 barco de contenedores para el armador es una ventaja y para el cliente tambi n
6610324 en el puerto no tenemos donde colocar esa cantidad de contenedores que hoy en d a se est n multiplicando por miles una gran cantidad de almacenes hoy en d a nos est n estorbando para aumentar ese flujo de carga

6610362 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6610363 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6610364 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6610365 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6610366 el resultado del presupuesto asignado para salud es la continuidad de una pol tica que se viene desarrollando hace m s de cuatro a os y que hoy se encuentra enmarcada en la ley provincial de salud un logro alcanzado el a o pasado que nos convierte en la nica provincia del pa s con una legislaci n de estas caracter sticas que posibilita que actualmente m s del diez por ciento del presupuesto general de misiones est destinado a la salud
6610367 si se tiene en cuenta los casi 2500 millones de pesos destinados al gasto social conformado por salud bienestar social y cultura y educaci n con respecto a los presupuestos anteriores y en el porcentaje de participaci n para el ejercicio 2009 salud es el rea que ha experimentado el mayor incremento 82 56 por ciento comparado con el a o 2008 y 141 40 por ciento con el 2007
6610368 el presupuesto total para el ministerio de salud p blica incluyendo cuentas especiales recibi un aumento del 60 por ciento si se lo compara con los montos asignados en el a o 2008 espec ficamente en lo que a personal se refiere incluyendo todo lo que compete a recursos humanos de planta permanente o temporaria recibi un 52 por ciento m s y en lo que hace a bienes y servicios de consumo como ser viandas ox geno medicamentos etc y a servicios no personales realizados por terceros como seguridad limpieza lavado de ropa cirug as tomograf as etc ha registrado un aumento del 78 por ciento en el rubro de bienes de capital es decir de aquellos equipamientos inventariados el aumento fue del 51 por ciento y en las partidas denominadas de transferencia en la que se incluyen becas y residencias m dicas becas de promotores de salud r gimen de retiro voluntarios extraordinarios becas de pasant as y capacitaci n y seguro provincial de salud fue del 68 por ciento

6610370 hay que reformar la carta org nica municipal pero hay puntos que no estoy de acuerdo como por ejemplo el aumento del n mero de concejales y la incorporaci n de un viceintendente aunque concretamente si estoy de acuerdo que se debe limitar la reelecci n de los intendentes y los concejales
6610371 particularmente se debe modificar el art culo que prev solamente cuatro secretar as para la municipalidad de eldorado y elevar el n mero a ocho para de este modo elevar al rango de secretar a lo que tiene que ver con la cooperaci n escolar y fundamentalmente llevar al rango de secretar a dos sectores del ejecutivo municipal como son deportes y turismo

6610405 im much more interested in laying out that choice clearly than i am in a bunch of high flying rhetoric
6610406 taking pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime
6610407 its a remarkable thing perhaps unequaled in modern history i dont think we have to shy away from the significance of that
6610408 will there be a handful of folks around the country who dont vote for me because of my race sure will there some who vote for me because of my race sure
6610409 folks like myself who are making a lot of money
6610410 ensure were not leaving a mountain of debt to the next generation
6610411 decide im going to be good for their pocketbook and good for their safety im going to win
6610412 and if they decide john mccain is going to do better at those things hes going to win
6610413 theres no doubt that the enthusiasm and grass roots energy we built carries with it its own dangers
6610414 were cutting through all the sizzle and getting to the steak
6610415 the prime minister thinks the military parade is inappropriate because of the cost at a time when ukraine has to cope with severe flooding but also because this flexing of muscles is a provocation
6610416 this is the first time weve seen this in seven years
6610417 why now and for what the president must be crazy to think he is scaring the russians
6610418 foreign and security policy has not before been an issue in ukrainian elections
6610419 but in the just beginning presidential elections it will be and it will be up to each party to explain their approach in the manifestos
6610420 we need a much more ambitious set of policies the eu cannot remain on the sidelines we need to demand that you the countries of western europe take a much more proactive approach to stability particularly in regard to frozen conflicts
6610421 the president took unilateral action in his announcement there must be a mechanism to cover this issue but if its not workable and not enforceable it could act as a pretext for the other side
6610422 its become really hard for us everything is pressure to use ukrainian and people get really mad if we dont
6610423 mr upshaw i know you were a member of the oakland raiders and we just hired the raiders former head coach bill callahan im just wondering what you thought of him and whether you think hell be able to turn get the program back on track
6610424 once a raider always a raider and they never let you forget
6610425 it used to be the former soviet union and america now with china doing so well its a matter of national pride to them
6610426 theres a real dichotomy there i think about it theyre much less inclined than australians to say so and so did a personal best and got bronze isnt that wonderful
6610427 its more likely to be he was expected to get gold and he only got bronze
6610428 i dont think theres any one right way to count it
6610429 if there is a right way i think it should be total medals per head of population which is about as egalitarian as you can get i suppose
6610430 they wont let me off and said he was told to return to his seat the paper said
6610431 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6610432 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6610433 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6610434 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6610435 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6610436 resolvimos cambiar porque no nos estaban acompa ando los resultados pasaban las fechas y no avanz bamos yo necesito sumar puntos importantes en esta fecha para seguir prendido en la lucha por el campeonato cada vez que sal amos a pista est bamos a un segundo de la punta

6610439 the land is getting very soft and the rape is looking very weathered
6610440 theres not a desperate panic for those crops but we need the ground to dry up even if the weather dries the ground will be too wet to travel on
6610441 the launch of best buy express is another way for best buy to provide consumers with the products they need from a brand they trust even while theyre on the go
6610442 land people food its a pretty simple idea happy days
6610443 all the mawassi people used to work in the settlements and make good money now there is nothing to do even our own agricultural land is barren
6610444 i have no fuel now for my car where can i go freedom is a slogan even for a donkey you need money which i dont have
6610445 every chance i get to come back to west virginia i do
6610446 its always exciting to come back and see my old hangouts i know everybody around town and they all come out to my shows its a lot of fun and they are all so supportive i use that positive energy to give a rockin show
6610447 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away she told aap
6610448 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6610449 that was the best way it could have been done he told reporters
6610450 that was a scene that we witnessed it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6610451 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6610452 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6610453 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6610454 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6610455 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6610456 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6610457 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6610458 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6610459 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6610460 well do an autposy on the whale to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6610461 in a positive impact on the cash flow situation of the state budget
6610462 could be used to lessen the amount of short term borrowing that the state currently undertakes for cash flow needs
6610463 not in any way interfere with the strategic balance in the region
6610464 i think that the connection between israel sending some weapon to georgia and saying that means russia will bring missiles to syria is wrong i mean russia has its own interests in the region no one wants to destabilize the region
6610465 there is an understanding between international leaders including the russians that the world cannot afford an iran with nuclear weapons
6610466 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6610467 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6610468 i recently purchased a printer from costco com two weeks later price protectr mailed me a notice that
6610469 a few minutes ago i got a notification that the keyboard i purchased from frys dropped 10
6610470 life is getting a little cheaper and easier to find price drops and it sure beats watching ads to see if a vender dropped a price on something you just purchased
6610471 your question is biased because you work at a pc magazine

6610483 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
6610484 the government is very careful as they are doing this as a restoration in light of their failure to lift the case in the supreme court
6610485 it is strange that this should be an object of judicial decision because it is premature
6610486 there was supposed to be a signing of memorandum of agreement last august 5 in kuala lumpur
6610487 that did not happen because it was overtaken by a temporary restraining order issued by our supreme court

6610503 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6610504 given the real time news cycle we live in today many important issues and controversies that impact our country simply do not receive the time and examination they deserve we are in this for the long haul and look forward to engaging on a broad range of issues well beyond the campaign
6610505 the launch of our immediate advocacy effort is a direct response to barack obamas rejection of public financing which will allow the liberal 527s and other leftist organizations to dramatically outspend conservatives this election cycle
6610506 senator obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the weathermen group as he does all acts of violence but he was an eight year old child when ayers and the weathermen were active and any attempt to connect obama with events of almost forty years ago is ridiculous
6610507 this may be the best researched most thoroughly documented ad in history when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines

6610525 the competition is something ive already done before but competing in front of thousands of people is definitely a new experience when i rode into the ring during the equestrian competition there were 33 000 people and a lot of them were waving american flags no matter what i did they cheered me on it was amazing
6610526 it was really a struggle until the last part of the day
6610527 i got a little bit nervous with the first couple phases it affected my performance a little bit physically i didnt feel all there the whole day for whatever reason it wasnt a good day but i was still pushing as hard as i could
6610528 the run and the swim hurt a little bit i got back in with the horse i moved up from 30th to 15th in one event that was a high point overall it was an ok day for the first go around
6610529 even though it is not going well overall sam has defeated the gold and silver medalist from the olympics in athens
6610530 hes not winning many bouts but hes beating the superstars he just beat viktor horvath from hungary the 2007 world champion
6610531 but instead of using it as a circle the organizers put in what turned out to be 24 turns of 45 to 90 degrees
6610532 im sure it will start to catch up now that im done and i have a chance to relax a little bit
6610533 ive been uptight the last couple of weeks now that everything is over i can sit back take it all in and relive it a little bit
6610534 i need to sit on my porch and talk it over with the family first
6610535 i cant really say what im planning at this time but its a possibility
6610536 alright i love ya but get the heck home will ya
6610537 paranoia defines the organizing principle of how racism functions in american culture today
6610538 a lot of folks i studied would tell me they couldnt wait to get back to the south once they retired
6610539 they told me there at least you know who is racist and who is not of course it was tongue in cheek but it said a lot about their suspicions
6610540 its whats left over once overt racism has been largely eliminated
6610541 how many of us actually have friends from a different race

6610548 finding solutions to americas crumbling infrastructure is an issue that senators obama and mccain and members of congress on both sides of the aisle should embrace
6610549 there are 18 billion dollars in infrastructure projects across the nation that are ready to go not roads to nowhere but projects that have been studied at length and validated beyond question we must join together to find solutions to this crisis and creating jobs by funding the 3 000 highway and transportation projects that are ready to begin immediately is a good place to start
6610550 washington has lost its values lost its principles lost its sense of purpose engaging in endless debate and partisan bickering while people in this country continue to suffer plain and simple washington has abandoned us
6610551 both presidential candidates along with congress must not waste this critical opportunity to put the economy back on track by funding critical infrastructure projects in a stimulus bill one of the most immediate and sustainable ways to shore up our struggling economy
6610552 investments in our countrys roads rails and bridges literally pay for themselves creating a five fold return in benefits to the state and national economy for every billion dollars spent on infrastructure 42 000 jobs are created or sustained and more than 5 70 of economic benefits is generated for every dollar invested
6610553 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6610554 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6610555 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6610556 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6610557 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6610558 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
6610559 i supported him but how can we nominate a man who might not even be legal its like giving the election to mccain and the republicans

6610567 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out

6610588 its a direct 180 change from where he was when he got elected and thats really frustrating i thin for many californians and for those of us in the legislature who supported him
6610589 one of the things that is still out of the budget proposal that we think is critical is having an actual spending cap

6610636 but in the event that we did the answer would be no for the simple reason that we are interested in the same types of opportunities for consolidation in the region and we are very busy at the moment
6610637 investor skittishness about continued delinquencies and defaults has resulted in higher risk premiums with additional fees layered on by fannie mae and freddie mac also increasing costs to borrowers
6610638 we can say that cruelty is used well if it is permissible to talk in this way of what is evil when it is employed once and for all and ones safety depends on it and then it is not persisted in but as far as possible turned to the good of ones subjects
6610639 violence must be inflicted once and for all people will then forget what it tastes like and so be less resentful
6610640 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
6610641 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6610642 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6610643 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6610644 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6610645 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6610646 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6610647 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6610648 if youre a leader but no one s following youre just taking a walk
6610649 who do i have to be to motivate this person
6610650 how can i acknowledge these team members for their contribution
6610651 se habla de una crisis energ tica cuando en realidad lo que estamos viviendo es un sistema interconectado que estructuralmente ya agot el esquema para el cual fue dise ado
6610652 en estos momentos desde el punto de vista estructural estamos haciendo el esfuerzo para materializar esta mega inversi n que se ha realizado para poder darles un servicio el ctrico de calidad
6610653 aqu hay un componente pol tico important simo el tema el ctrico se ha tomado como una bandera pol tica irresponsablemente muchos actores que en su oportunidad tuvieron la responsabilidad de la direcci n del sector el ctrico tambi n jugaron sus intereses particulares de cada una de las empresas sobre el inter s com n de este modo la corporaci n el ctrica abraza el inter s com n bajo un sistema nacionalizado
6610654 los ltimos d as hemos estado realizando a trav s de todo el pa s la nacionalizaci n de las cementeras es importante resaltar los buenos acuerdos que en el marco del proceso de socializaci n se ha llegado con la mayor a de las cementeras
6610655 el respeto de los derechos y la estabilidad de los trabajadores hoy estamos haciendo un recorrido en esta planta para hablar con los trabajadores sobre sus condiciones de trabajo
6610656 en las plantas que hemos visitado nos encontramos con mucha receptividad por parte de los trabajadores es importante destacar que las empresas contin an laborando normalmente ahora el estado desea maximizar su productividad con una visi n integrada a sus necesidades
6610657 deseamos igualmente integrar estas plantas a las comunidades para que el pueblo pueda tener acceso al cemento y de esta forma las viviendas y los grandes proyectos del gobierno nacional se reimpulsen

6610659 i have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them but for the first time i believe i have found the man who could be that president not just for me but for a new generation of americans
6610660 its not how many times you fall down its how many times you get back up that counts
6610661 the evidence we have heard during this inquiry can lead to only one conclusion that whatever short term fluctuations occur and whatever regulatory action is taken in the uk to improve the functioning of the energy markets as the minister of state for energy malcolm wicks recently stated the era of cheap energy is surely over
6610662 the enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty
6610663 we feel confident that the strong line up of films in the second half will drive admissions particularly in the fourth quarter when james bond quantum of solace madagascar 2 and high school musical 3 hit our screens
6610664 it confirms that businesses are being forced to retrench in the face of the economic slowdown the worsening economic pressures emphasise the need for the monetary policy committee and the government to take the correct measures to counter the threat of recession
6610665 we hope that displaying carbon footprints will raise awareness among consumers as well as companies of their emissions and motivate them to emit less c02
6610666 the current market conditions increase the valuation challenges and risks faced by banks and investment firms
6610667 firms valuation processes and controls have become increasingly stretched and in some cases have proven to be materially flawed or inadequate
6610668 we recommend that you consider carefully any headcount reduction exercises that will affect valuation control functions at this sensitive time
6610669 biotech is a long term game and it is rarely smooth
6610670 the savvy investor knows that it takes a long time and that if they back 10 companies it would only take two to work in order for him to be in the money
6610671 there are a number of venture capital backers that do come in and support biotech groups in the initial stages but there is a gap in the middle of a companys development
6610672 things look pretty grim for those companies that need to raise money in the next 12 months
6610673 because of the current economic climate it is very difficult to attract funds at the moment but while this is a deep point in the cycle investors will return when the market improves
6610674 a back of the envelope calculation back in 2002 03 suggested that several key biotech groups were trading on an enterprise value basis of close to nothing meaning that the technology was worth pretty much zero
6610675 rather than avoid the sector investors should go bottom fishing and invest in 10 biotech stocks and then forget about them for a few years you can almost guarantee that one or two will be terrific successes
6610676 the limited ambition of uk biotech management was compounded by uk investors much lower risk appetite this contrasted with us management who were focused on higher investment returns and building a more sustainable business
6610677 all we can say is that since april things have got no worse but no better either
6610678 the company has a sound track record and is probably as well placed as any for a property market upturn but there are no indications that this is yet on the horizon
6610679 there are guaranteed sales and no marketing costs involved and affordable homes are now an important part of our portfolio
6610680 no rights issue is planned we intend to reduce debts by around 200m by the year end
6610681 we now await the autumn selling season which depending on the level of activity will help to give a clearer picture for 2009
6610682 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies
6610683 typically there is a lag between individuals facing tough financial circumstances and when they become insolvent
6610684 it will be the next six to 12 months which reveal how seriously the credit crunch has affected individuals
6610685 it seems strange that when figures are bad they are also often late if we are to have any confidence in government figures we must know that they are fully independent late or inaccurate statistics only go to further undermine this governments credibility
6610686 few retailers will recognise this positive picture these ons figures suggest julys total sales values were up 3 8 per cent on a year ago well above the miserly 1 7 per cent shown by the brcs figures its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons is reporting or its finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones we respect the onss process but this report doesnt seem to reflect the current retail reality
6610687 does not effectively reflect sales by small and medium businesses
6610688 does not include businesses in sectors which have shown relatively strong growth in recent periods for example the internet only retailers of home entertainment and major food discount stores
6610689 i dont think there is a great risk of a major policy error but it probably does mean that it increases the chances of an error the bigger risk is it delays policy from becoming pre emptive
6610690 we dont even have a precise picture of the current state of the economy as a result controlling the economy has been likened to driving along a winding road looking only in the rear view mirror indeed its worse than that as we dont even have that good a view of where it has been in the past either it is as if the rear window is also a bit misted up
6610691 the conformity of the picture given by the distributive trades survey with other potential indicators of spending such as consumer confidence and the agents reports have led us to place less weight on the official data on retail spending for the present
6610692 we continue to see at amp t as a far more likely buyer
6610693 at amp t has a stated interest of international expansion in the corporate space and cable amp wireless could help with that
6610694 clearly there is potential to put its cash pile to work in extending an already impressive m amp a merger and acquisition track record
6610695 although life is tough for the sector schroders has surplus capital
6610696 although seemingly reticent in pursuing opportunities before it had the platform in asset management in particular to look at larger deals now
6610697 this remains a potential catalyst for future share price performance conversely demerger talk has ebbed recently
6610698 there are some large bears in this sector and this has squeezed them pretty hard
6610699 sig has underperformed the ftse all share by some 3 per cent in the past month leaving it on 6 5 times 2009 pe price earnings ratio and a 7 per cent yield contrast that with wolseley up 20 per cent relative in the past one month on 10 5 times 2009 pe with a 2 per cent yield and we believe there is an obvious switch emerging
6610700 the shares have strengthened by 13 per cent over the past 10 days but with huntsworth trading on 2008 2009 pes of 7 3 times 6 9 times and ev ebitda enterprise value underlying earnings ratio of 5 times 4 3 times the valuation remains attractive
6610701 we actually believe in a 20 year super cycle for commodities
6610702 superman and prophet we have no equivalent in the united states
6610703 es totalmente falso que se haya producido una ca da en la producci n de carne nacional la nica ca da que se ha originado fue en el a o 2003 ocasionada por la acci n de algunos participantes del paro petrolero que intentaron rendir al pueblo con hambre sacrificando vientres y reses
6610704 se ha autorizado este a o la importaci n de 110 a 120 mil toneladas de carne de las cuales hasta el momento han llegado 60 mil y hasta el mes de julio se han logrado distribuir 250 mil toneladas de carne de producci n nacional por lo que es importante esa diferenciaci n en cuanto a los vol menes de importaci n y el incremento que ha logrado la producci n nacional
6610705 hemos hecho adecuaci n de los precios y excluido de la regulaci n algunos otros productos y seremos muy severos en la aplicaci n de medidas cuando se intente atacar al pueblo con la especulaci n por lo que estamos aplicando inspecciones chequeos decomisos y sanciones para aquellos sectores que est n especulando

6610710 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6610711 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6610712 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is

6610733 shes been open in telling us she would like to spend time overseas and that is her right

6610747 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6610748 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6610749 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6610750 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6610751 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6610752 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6610753 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6610754 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6610755 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6610756 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6610785 we need to safeguard those who should be in the building and those who should not be in the building

6610787 i suppose if you have seven or eight houses the economy looks pretty sound to you

6610789 its unthinkable to ask the government to force the church to abandon one of its sacraments to appease a radical anti religious agenda yet thats what this activist group did

6610812 the president and prime minister reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6610813 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6610814 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6610815 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6610816 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6610817 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6610818 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6610819 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6610820 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6610821 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly

6610829 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6610830 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year
6610831 if the default pricing formula was kept beyond next season it would create a real risk of processors making investment decisions that are economically unsustainable

6610885 in urlscan 3 0 we added the ability to do filtering based on the query string in addition to the url
6610886 we also added the ability to create more granular rules that can be targeted to specific types of requests for example you can write a rule that only applies to asp pages or php pages which is something you would never be able to do in urlscan 2 5
6610887 really the application running on the server is the only piece of code that actually knows what the sql query is intended to do
6610888 so the fix for the root cause is for application developers to go in and do the validation and make sure that the sql data that they are sending to the sql server is what they intend

6610920 i have absolutely no intention of telling men what to do
6610921 my main intention in straying into the wolrd of fathers when this book is written primarily for mothers is to honour men their humour their intuition their strength and above all else their maleness
6610922 where at all possible raising a boy should be a partnership between his mother and father
6610923 your sons want you to step up elbowing their mothers aside if you need to

6610931 shes really taken the age factor out of the sport
6610932 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6610933 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6610934 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of my business
6610935 you think 45 month unlimited data for iphone is too much
6610936 where people had chosen to go back to work the primary feedback ive had is that what people feel it will take to move the bank is beyond what they are prepared to do at this stage campbell said
6610937 those members who have decided to stay out feel the difference between a 4 percent offered by the bank and 5 percent rise is so minimal for a billion dollar bank to afford
6610938 if the storm surge is six foot like they say some of the models might be it could swell up and push our boat into the lift so we want to get it off while we can

6610940 when it comes to presenting music from the 5 th dimension it was really important for us to attempt to recreate the original harmonies of the group to the best of our abilities it was the original harmonies that made us stand out when we first began we have always been proud of its uniqueness
6610941 after the death of ron townson and the retirement of lamonte mclemore we realize that it will be impossible to ever duplicate the sound again through a reunion of the original members however we have tried to come as close as possible
6610942 you dont have to be a star to be in my show
6610943 we have learned that our music is a mutual experience that we have been fortunate to share we are gratified by the audience participation as they are reminded of possibly kinder gentler times
6610944 we are so thankful that we have been able to realize the dream that we had from our youth to have a career in music and to enjoy so many levels of success we want to feature some of those highlights in the 40

6610946 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
6610947 withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance
6610948 often the patients maintain their indifference in spite of opposition it may be that very strongly negativistic patients are permanently euphoric and do not come out of this mood while they resist with bites scratches and blows the invitation to shake hands their defense is sport for them like a jolly play more commonly the whole behavior looks like that of a flirt women patients watch the physician as if they were waiting for him to offer them his hand or bring forward a request so that he must busy himself with them and then in their negation behave like a maiden who stimulates her lover but tries to appear as if she were keeping him off at other times the negativism has a plainly erotic character sometimes in the agreeable sense of a love play sometimes in an unpleasant sense as the aversion to an attack and often in both directions at once
6610949 how fast can one man go before you cant go faster

6610952 if everything had gone well we may have made the semi
6610953 im disappointed we did not get to play for fifth or sixth that would have been more accurate
6610954 i think youll find this is the end of the road for our no 1 goalkeeper paul woolford and three or four others are probably thinking about
6610955 ive not fully decided yet im still playing for my dutch club rotterdam so ill still be involved but new zealand wise i may take a break im certainly not playing everything i need to freshen up a bit
6610956 its been disappointing personally because of the setback with my finger i wasnt at my best

6610958 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus
6610959 when we were drinking we were drinking with each other we werent drinking against each other
6610960 there was therefore a sharp reversal of the trend possibly because of the enactment of the minimum age 21 laws and despite the continuing campaign against drunk driving
6610961 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6610962 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6610963 i think every chinese person feel upset that liu xiang can not go to final and get medal
6610964 we know he had injury we have confidence he come back maybe at london he get medal back
6610965 i feel a little bit of pity and sorrow but i think we can see a better liu xiang maybe someday
6610966 i can understand why he is not here because his career is more important
6610967 being here is a good thing i am happy to be here
6610968 this generation of college students and their parents are closer relationship wise than any other generation
6610969 it is the complete opposite of the late 60s they want independence but they also value the role of their parents and family in a drastically different way
6610970 frankly we know this is just the beginning of this generation
6610971 they arent going away so were trying to embrace working with the parents theyve been super involved in their kids lives since birth they arent just going to stop because we say so
6610972 it was the complete opposite of pomona college where my other son went
6610973 there they told us to stay away here it was more about telling us what is available to students and ways parents can get involved they still told us students needed to be independent but they were a lot more accommodating of parents
6610974 ten years ago if students were having a problem the calls went to a staff member in the dean of students office
6610975 now without question the calls go home first so we have to partner with parents to help students become self reliant adults we view parents as agents of student retention
6610976 they told us that if we didnt sign up we basically dont have any access to his life at all
6610977 honestly i have open doors with my parents but its good because theres a chance they could catch something about bills being due that i might miss with guest link
6610978 its always nice to have someone who has your back
6610979 this group of parents are doers used to making a difference
6610980 it was a great event and we couldnt have done it without the parents
6610981 it is about encouraging independence and responsibility in the student but keeping parents informed too
6610982 kids need to make their own mistakes but that said if parents are informed about what the university has in place to keep our kids safe and healthy then when they do call us we can give them advice instead of freaking out and driving to the campus if you feel the university is keeping you away from your child you get more worried
6610983 of course you know your student best but at the university we have found
6610984 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6610985 henry parkes would be worried about the ageing of the teaching workforce the failure of both governments to invest in public schools to secure its future the growth in funding of private education and the so called values debate

6610989 even according to the governments evidence that theyre putting forth jesse isnt even a principal in murder and rape
6610990 it surprises me that theyre treating him like theyre treating green
6610991 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad
6610992 kevin has obviously taken over as captain and everyone is eager to impress england for a long time now have under performed in one day cricket and weve got a chance to address that now and hopefully put some performances in
6610993 we got to the world cup final in 1992 and since then weve never been consistent
6610994 were definitely aware of that but we cant let it lie too heavily on us weve got to go out there and perform and were well aware of that but weve got to do it consistently
6610995 theyre the form side theyve beaten everyone theyve come up against
6610996 they are a formidable team in one day internationals and its going to be tough for us but weve got to test ourselves against these sides
6610997 weve beaten the best sides in the world before but weve got to beat them over a period of time and not just in one off games
6610998 i believe that alcohol is a greater problem an even greater menace than the illicit drug problem

6611011 for a while europeans were forced to grow american grapes
6611012 the fragolino you find on the market is no longer the real fragolino it is a wine produced using european grapes and then chemically flavored the real fragolino should be produced with american origin grapes i suppose that in america you have identical wine although named differently
6611013 the bottle had no label it was cold sweet and like nothing i had ever had before it occurred to me that it was strawberry wine
6611014 we hear a great deal about the cause of the war that it was a question of the rights of smaller nations but as a matter of fact it is simply a trade war those who are now our enemies before the war had been capturing our trade i say deliberately in spite of all the things we hear about the war that it is an ordinary trade war
6611015 again and again simpsons allegiance to class his vehemence and anger have been erased in favour of the simple tale centred on his alleged loyalty to mother nation empire and in the last instance to his manhood
6611016 i often wonder when the working men of england will wake up and see things as other people see them what they want in england is a good revolution and that will clear some of these millionaires and lords and dukes out of it and then with a labour government they will almost be able to make their own conditions

6611037 are you contending that localized fires caused all 47 columns to fail simultaneously so that the building collapsed in 8 seconds
6611038 ya know a lot of conspiracy theorists claim that this looked like a controlled demolition because the building fell into such a neat pile can you explain why it was not a controlled demolition
6611039 well you know in a controlled demolition charges are placed on many columns yadda yadda you can go to a website and see what a controlled demolition looks like didnt look like this

6611045 given its narrow confines a short story cannot probe character beyond a few basic traits it cannot allow for great scenic detail or elaborate plot to illuminate the conduct of its protagonist effective as a means for providing sudden insight or creating a powerful emotional impact it cannot diffuse its focus to include anything beyond the immediately relevant
6611046 no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of wtc 7 or reported by witnesses
6611047 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6611048 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6611049 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6611050 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6611051 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6611058 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring habitual snoring defined as loud and disturbing snoring at least three nights a week was reported by 18
6611059 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring

6611084 this work was built in occasion for the cumbre sobre desarollo sostenible to mark the summit of sustainable growth in santa cruz de la sierra the bolivian city chosen for the meeting of the presidents of north and south america the project is called for an entrance area to the park which functions as a vital green space within the historic city a rectangular urban void surrounded by a series of concentric commuter roads leading out to the outlying neighborhoods the project foresees the consolidation of the two corners of the park adjacent to the city and the building of two multi level towers providing a series of linked interior stairways set within the walls leading to a series of balconies from which people can look down and enjoy the three dimensional structure of the city at their summits the two towers house technical spaces and by night they are linked to each other by a luminous ray of laser light that creates a kind of city gate on the ground floor the two corner buildings are connected by a long line of stone slabs that marks a stream punctuated at regular intervals by fountains and which runs the entire two hundred meter length of the front of the park the l shaped form of the tower walls a mass that is both open and divided in sections is remarkable for providing both an inside and an outside this reinforces both its role as an angular reference point and the excavated sculptural quality of the work a quality that offers an architectonic journey towards new viewpoints to the landscape below this monument even if symbolic is very clear in the reading of its functions delightfully evoking a mood of recreation and relaxation it even becomes a recognizable part of the park entrance reinvented as a signal a way of linking up with and relating to the context

6611093 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6611094 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6611095 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6611096 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes

6611125 dennis testified he hoped to start a business and that he diligently paid his bills on time for years so that he would have a clean credit history when he sought financing for the venture the only blemish on his credit report in april 2003 was the erroneously reported judgment according to dennis that was enough to cause several lenders to decline his applications for credit dashing his hopes of starting a new business dennis also claims that experians error caused his next landlord to demand that dennis pay a greater security deposit

6611127 if anyone is really that hung up on the secret ballot crap then they should be asked why they arent upset by the fact that current law allows unions to be decertified by card check the only change with the employee free choice act is whether card check recognition is at the discretion of the employer of the worker in other words it changes absolutely zero about whether the right of workers to organize is determined by secret ballot or not the only thing it changes is who gets to decide the manner of certification workers or employers

6611206 we are surrounded by actors who can not act singers who cannot sing teachers who cannot teach writers who cannot write speakers who cannot speak painters who cannot paint and we pay them fortunes for their mediocrity
6611207 observe i suggest no sense of service more hypocrisy is poured out to youthful ears in the name of serving mankind than would fill a library of books i can remember the droning on that score that i had to listen to that i should become a drudge in some distasteful pursuit to assist a mankind not visibly affected by similar endeavors if it be selfishness to work on a job one likes and live as one wants because one likes it and for no other end let us accept the odium i had rather live forever in a company of don quixotes than among a set of the walking dead professing to be solely moved to the betterment of one another let us then do our jobs for ourselves and we are in no danger of deserving society though six associations groups companies combinations of societies for the improvement of mankind with their combined boards of directors secretaries stenographers and field agents were to be put into some scale against six honest carpenters who liked their job and did their work with excellence they would kick the beam as high as euripides the six honest excellent carpenters may serve as a beacon for all time and men will love them but be that as it may six honest carpenters who do their job with excellence because they like it and for no other reason will save themselves that is quite enough to ask
6611208 if we lose the sense of excellence in our daily labor we will become weak as a people and as a nation if we lose our respect and admiration for craftsmanship our vigor as a people will decline
6611209 those who lack talent expect things to happen without effort they ascribe failure to a lack of inspiration or ability or to misfortune rather than to insufficient application thus talent is a species of vigor
6611210 people do not stumble into excellence it requires application and tenacity of purpose
6611211 our schools are crying for uncommon teachers who are excellent outstanding and distinguished
6611212 the central task of education is to implant a will and facility for learning it should produce not learned but learning people the truly human society is a learning society where grandparents parents and children are students together
6611213 in a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future the learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists
6611214 because of the economic condition we did not have to be as promotional on the buy side of games because it just seems like we were naturally getting consumers trading games in thats why our margins are slightly better than they were in the second quarter last year

6611227 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6611228 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6611229 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis
6611230 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6611231 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states
6611232 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally
6611233 some religious groups refuse vaccination but many parents have fears that vaccines are unsafe or may cause conditions such as autism fears the cdc says are unfounded
6611234 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states

6611236 the chief negotiators will meet next week to discuss sticky issues because we feel that the talks need to focus more now on the key sensitive areas
6611237 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6611238 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6611239 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6611240 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6611241 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6611242 eventually we seek to engineer systems where a drug could be delivered to a specific tissue or set of cells anywhere in the body we want to make that possible
6611243 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6611244 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6611245 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product

6611248 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6611249 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6611250 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
6611251 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements
6611252 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6611253 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6611254 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6611255 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6611256 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6611257 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6611258 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine

6611266 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6611267 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6611268 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6611269 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6611270 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6611271 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
6611272 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
6611273 all your are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed

6611276 oh the whale is being wiped out by mankind save the fucking whales
6611277 theres a certain percentage of the population that will always be turned off by politics but i think because montanas democratic primary played such an important role that theres a lot more interest
6611278 hey this is not a lending library put the magazine back or ill blow your heads off

6611283 the architect did a great job of keeping a more residential feel even though it is a civic building

6611291 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6611292 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6611293 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe
6611294 radioactive waste is a big problem facing the united states and the entire world
6611295 we need new innovative technology and i think supercritical fluid is one such technology that will play an important role in the very near future
6611296 there is no solvent used and so no solvent left behind
6611297 this agreement and technology is something idaho should be very proud of
6611298 we have developed something special and to me that something is important to idaho and to the u s particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6611299 this process has been extremely one of those that you just love
6611300 its going to be a great deal that will benefit the university of idaho areva and the entire world
6611301 to me accomplishing that is important to idaho and to the united states particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6611302 i believe nuclear energy will play a very large role and that it can be done in a very environmentally safe and sustainable way
6611303 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6611304 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
6611305 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6611306 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6611307 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6611308 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6611309 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6611310 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6611311 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6611312 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6611313 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6611317 a clear message to the community that ignoring your fines does not make them go away
6611318 theyve been marginally successful for us the percentage we were recovering two years ago was 40 now its up to 53
6611319 i think were still in a situation where were not recovering enough
6611320 we could certainly run a few more child care centres
6611321 the amount owing to the city of port phillip is decreasing mostly because the infringements court is writing off more fines because five years has elapsed
6611322 the state government has had the power to clamp vehicles suspend vehicle registration and drivers licences and to garnishee wages of fine defaulters but nothing has happened

6611324 i was just idling out ready to do some shots photos
6611325 i went up over the bridge at oran park and thought shit theres some tyres
6611326 we werent going super quick maybe 50 per cent hot pace
6611327 but just because its so blind i didnt see the tyres until it was too late
6611328 think im likely to get one as a company car
6611329 ive hardly put a scratch on the race car all year then this happens i was a bit embarrassed and pissed off
6611330 i actually thought it might have stopped it was going that slowly when it crashed
6611331 with the magnitude of global issues such as climate change and oil depletion its difficult to know what to do transition initiatives address that with practical and proven ways to relocalise communities and bring people together
6611332 we are our greatest resource if people can take action and responsibility for these issues not only will they make a difference in their own lives but significant people and community power can bring real changes at government and policy level when you join the transition network you are joining thousands of others working on the same issues
6611333 becoming an official initiative is a great step forward weve already been working together for a year through the relocalisation network on things such as creating local food supplies permablitzes working bees in members gardens starting a co operative bulk buying sharing skills and knowledge and generally helping each other prepare for a future of climate and energy supply uncertainty
6611334 theres also a very high take up for the option pack over 70 per cent for the three door barina
6611335 now is not the time for the government to dilly dally around with debates between the treasury and finance and industry departments as to whether or not the plan presented by steve bracks should be accepted
6611336 there is clear evidence there needs to be direct government intervention now
6611337 within the segment the new falcon is doing very well but customers are changing their preferences and we are seeing a decline in large car sales overall
6611338 global economic factors are also contributing to a softening in the overall level of new car sales we are projecting

6611367 through a series of meetings we had there was a lot of the community that expressed concerns about the monthly payments and so they looked at 30 years and found that they could make it a little easier on the pocket book to go through 30 years
6611368 weve got a ways to go were not as clean as we should be

6611381 this is turning out to be one of new zealands worst sewage disasters in years
6611382 because the bunds and makeshift emergency ponds the council is making are unlined there is absolutely no doubt sewage is seeping into the lake as well
6611383 none of us had really thought about working here but now we all have
6611384 places like wellington are big business areas but here you can kind of make your mark
6611385 we hold a different view that the sewerage treatment is not functioning as well as it should
6611386 its not suitable for human contact its effluent its simply a high standard of partly treated sewage

6611407 she doesnt want to have to put your name all over everything
6611408 tell her to get a job that has insurance and that will fix that problem

6611413 its been frustrating for me personally one error letting me down and you remember those its skill execution
6611414 but a lot of players never get a chance to challenge for the ranfurly shield
6611415 with the shield youve only got to get it right for 80 minutes and thats how well treat it
6611416 theres no pressure on us weve just got to go out and perform
6611417 they are travelling really well and it should be a great challenge

6611445 we are urging brits to be particularly vigilant when they travel abroad this summer
6611446 when relaxing on holiday people can be less aware of their belongings and more prone to card fraud and mugging scams we are encouraging people to contact their banks before travelling to keep their valuables out of sight once abroad and to be especially careful when they use their credit and debit cards
6611447 as a nation we are all using our cards more frequently abroad so it pays to be aware of any extra costs that may be incurred for using them overseas as well as taking steps to protect them from fraud
6611448 card thieves are hoping to catch us relaxed and off guard when we are overseas so we need to take the same sensible precautions with our cards abroad as we would in the uk

6611475 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6611476 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year
6611477 if the default pricing formula was kept beyond next season it would create a real risk of processors making investment decisions that are economically unsustainable

6611502 we estimate that a move to less intensive more health oriented livestock farming could reduce farm antibiotic use by up to 75 this would help to safeguard the future effectiveness of critically important drugs and over the coming years save countless human lives
6611503 the government needs to get a grip on the situation quickly
6611504 we accept there are occasions when these antibiotics should legitimately be used on farms to prevent the death or suffering of large mammals like cattle and pigs but it is quite clear that through ignorance of the long term consequences many vets and farmers are still choosing them just because they are modern medicines when for most conditions there are equally effective alternatives

6611521 i got all worked up someone pissed me off and said the wrong thing screw it im eating whatever i want
6611522 okay when i get mad i have a tendency to not care what i eat i know thats a pattern ive had in the past whats something different i can do in the future when i get mad
6611523 when i feel that way in the future what am i going to do am i going to beat myself up about it or am i going to learn from it
6611524 im exhausted im really tired i work hard and ive got a lot of responsibility im tired
6611525 im looking to just relax zone out and forget about it all
6611526 great thats what youve got to do what would be ideal if you could eat and feel exactly what you wanted what would you feel
6611527 id feel energized id be able to eat relax and then id get some energy and i could do some other more things
6611528 okay what is another way whats something else you could do other than eating that may bring you closer to that feeling
6611529 okay would that be something you could see yourself doing in that situation
6611530 i did it and i found i would only sleep for half hour forty five minutes and i would wake up and i would feel so relaxed and calm and id have a nice level of energy and my eating just got better on its own
6611531 oh i cant eat but i dont know any other way to let this upset go and calm myself down
6611532 if i could do that over again what would i do differently
6611533 if i could do it over again knowing everything i know now what would i have done differently
6611534 the bad news is that their money is all gone but the good news is that i have effectively doubled our family income if one is allowed like the government and social security to double count the money i borrowed from them as still being in their accounts although i spent it accounting magic
6611535 its a devastating set back for law enforcement weve been operating for 20 years our technology is improving in how we do things and a ruling like this comes down and it sets us back 20 years

6611543 the great moderation the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over the past twenty years is a striking economic development whether the dominant cause of the great moderation is structural change improved monetary policy or simply good luck is an important question about which no consensus has yet formed i have argued today that improved monetary policy has likely made an important contribution not only to the reduced volatility of inflation which is not particularly controversial but to the reduced volatility of output as well moreover because a change in the monetary policy regime has pervasive effects i have suggested that some of the effects of improved monetary policies may have been misidentified as exogenous changes in economic structure or in the distribution of economic shocks this conclusion on my part makes me optimistic for the future because i am confident that monetary policymakers will not forget the lessons of the 1970s
6611544 dream to build a knowledge based economy based on an army of trained scientists remains a dream

6611563 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6611564 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional
6611565 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6611566 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6611567 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6611568 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6611569 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it
6611570 the unnecessary removal of non infringing material causes significant injury to the public where time sensitive or controversial subjects are involved and the counter notification remedy does not sufficiently address these harms

6611625 this is for people to come together be out on the street to light up the night and show there is a lot of care and support in rockridge and oakland for everyone here
6611626 we are very aware that these crimes can impact not only the individual business but also the entire retail district
6611627 merchants are also very concerned that the public know that oaklands merchants are open for business and that we encourage shoppers diners and investors to continue to visit our stores and businesses
6611628 we live here we wont stop coming out in the evenings
6611629 it makes us more aware of whats happening around us
6611630 the recent crime spree gives you pause no doubt about that you always think it wont happen to you
6611631 i think that everyone in oakland will be thinking twice about going out to eat
6611632 first of all the cost of eating out is expensive enough as it is im not going to run the risk of being robbed on top of that however slight the chance may be
6611633 we want to take the opportunity to walk the street together and strengthen the relationships already there
6611634 we want to show support for pasta pomodoro and all merchants
6611635 if people call us before the fact and request a business security survey it helps them to be less vulnerable

6611642 there are noticeable changes in the physiology of the older dog after age four or five the brain begins to lose weight and bulk at a rate of 2 to 5 percent per year thus the brain of a twelve year old labrador retriever may weigh 25 percent less than it did when the dog was four
6611643 especially important in senior dogs that have developed physical mental or hormonal weaknesses
6611644 they may not secrete the digestive juices needed for efficient breakdown of dietary proteins weak digestion of proteins would impair the senior dogs ability to produce neurotransmitters or protein hormones such as thyroxine thyroid hormone

6611646 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6611647 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6611648 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6611649 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health

6611712 josephine seems to have been attracted to freemasonry quite early in her career perhaps partly because it was considered to be very fashionable among women of the aristocracy and partly because her first husband the viscount de beauharnais had been a prominent freemason who came from a family of illustrious freemasons
6611713 being a freemason initiated in the ancient mysteries and now with all this post revolution talk of deism it may be possible that josephine had begun to take an interest in islam and may even have privately encouraged napoleon to bring it into the fold of western europe for it is well known that her first cousin and closest friend the beautiful aimee duburcq de rivery had been kidnapped by arab pirates and sold to the harem of the sultan of turkey abdul hamid i where she soon became his favourite concubine and bore him a son the emir mahmoud when the old sultan died aimee became the mistress of the heir apparent the young and glamorous nephew of the sultan the emir selim over whom aimee was to wield enormous influence by turning him into a keen francophile there thus existed a dynastic link between josephine of france and her cousin the sultana of turkey a connection which might have brought the middle east and islam within josephines and napoleons minds he would one day write to her from egypt these curious words i saw myself founding a new religion marching into asia riding an elephant a turban on my head and in my hand a koran that i would have composed to suit my needs but whether or not such words were written in jest we shall never know

6611726 we still have to expand our internal alpha to include the rest of the organization iterate on that feedback and then we have to evaluate what kind of beta we need whether we need one at all theres a pretty high level of certainty that were going to need a beta and then we have to decide if we want to do a host beta or a closed beta or both so months

6611731 the biggest thing for us is immersing the player in the story as far as single player goes we got a pretty rich universe that we want to leverage as far as that goes
6611732 in most rts games we just start you with marines and then two missions later heres your firebats heres your your bolsters or your tanks or whatever now how those new things get parcelled out to you the choice is now in your hands
6611733 what do you want next do you want to save your credits and get tech sooner or do you want to just upgrade your infantry how do you want to evolve your army over the course of the campaign that sort of thing
6611734 really passionate about leveraging the starcraft universe for a different genre then thats something they would seriously consider

6611738 hoy es diferente pero el llamado a la selecci n siempre te causa ilusi n y tambi n me causa ilusi n ir a jugar en el teresa herrera a reencontrarme con viejos amigos ir a una casa que es como un escaparate pero la realidad es que me qued con la ilusi n de jugar sin embargo siempre estuve apoyando al equipo para que ganara

6611748 het was gewoon onwerkelijk net zo onwerkelijk als het moment waarop ik zeven jaar geleden hoorde dat ik leukemie had
6611749 maar zo koeltjes als ik destijds die woorden tot me nam zo afstandelijk tikte ik hier als eerste aan
6611750 er werd aanvankelijk nogal terughoudend gereageerd het kon niet gezegd worden kreeg ik te horen maar dat accepteerde ik niet ik ben realist ik moest het weten toen bleek het 30 tot 50 procent te zijn daarop ben ik het ziekenhuis ingegaan en heb ik een half jaar lang alle behandelingen ondergaan
6611751 dat ik hier zit dank ik voor een groot deel aan de donateurs van het kankerfonds zij hebben het met hun bijdrage mede mogelijk gemaakt dat ik ben genezen en hier kon winnen
6611752 de leukemie heeft me geleerd stap voor stap te denken wanneer je in een ziekenhuisbed ligt en zo verschrikkelijk veel pijn hebt kun je niet denken aan de volgende week zelfs niet aan de volgende dag je denkt hooguit aan het volgende uur je moet geduld hebben afwachten diezelfde strategie heb ik vandaag in deze race gehanteerd rustig blijven en je kans afwachten
6611753 het zou mooi zijn voor het verhaal maar eerlijk gezegd had ik het daarvoor gewoon te druk met mijn tactiek
6611754 het is heel kwalijk dat hij op deze manier andere pati nten probeert te inspireren ik hoop niet dat hij mensen op de gedachte brengt dat ze wel even kunnen wachten met behandelen als ze iets belangrijkers te doen hebben
6611755 maar zijn verhaal is mij iets te amerikaans hij lag in het ziekenhuis vocht tegen de kanker en iedere keer als hij moest overgeven gooide hij de zieke vijand er uit hij streed en overwon ik heb die periode heel anders beleefd eigenlijk heb ik alles lijdzaam ondergaan ik wil hier niet de indruk wekken dat ik zelf de ziekte heb overwonnen dat is niet zo
6611756 de mensen om me heen de dokters en medici hebben me genezen ik heb nooit hoeven vechten tegen kanker vandaag heb ik pas gevochten voor deze gouden medaille

6611767 rob this is stupid if you dont know that then you dont know what youre doing this isnt making any sense what would posses lead you to come in here of all places and do something like this do you even know what are in these tanks
6611768 mostly i guess not all of them though but the substance theyre caught in is toxic on more levels than we have measurements for youve killed yourself
6611769 how could you do this to me where have you been what happened whos been feeding you the whack job milkshakes
6611770 regina theres something i never told you if youre here with these things then you at least have the possibility of believing me i have certain psychic abilities
6611771 no shit sherlock did you think i was an idiot
6611772 of course i knew i remember spending the night in your room and there are only so many hands you can be fondled with at once genius you had the subtlety of a neon green elephant stampede
6611773 am i the only one who notices the gun pointed at your head try not insulting me
6611774 oh please if you were going to kill me youd have done it by now youre only here to kill yourself
6611775 its not like ill have a conscience to bother me once i do so just dont push it
6611776 you never had a conscience rob it was what attracted me to you in the first place you took bad boy to a whole new level i guess i never should have expected much out of you but i thought youd at least tell me to fuck off when you went
6611777 the protective gear is for the fluid its god i wish theyd come up with something not used in a movie for this its ectoplasm
6611778 yes physical manifestation of psychic vibrations its the byproduct of spectral activity its the only thing that will contain the test subjects
6611779 i dont see how someone who just called himself a psychic would think that its so funny
6611780 they can produce substances the compounds are beyond chemical identification but they have numerous physiological effects medicine toxins weve even seen effects in test subjects that allow us to outgrow the human potential
6611781 great so youve taken grave robbing to the next level
6611782 hey at least i have a point whats the point of what youre doing again
6611783 are you going to answer my question what exactly is the point of all this
6611784 im fixing your screwup these people need to be set free
6611785 theyre not people rob theyre psychic reverberations theyre just test subjects now
6611786 at least tell me why you left before you go
6611787 because i knew you were more of a monster than i would ever be the only shred of humanity i had left demanded that i leave you behind
6611788 did it ever occur to you that the visions were avoidable do you really have to be ruled by your powers

6611792 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6611793 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6611794 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6611795 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6611796 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6611797 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6611798 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6611799 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6611800 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6611801 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6611802 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6611803 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6611836 she wore a thong but only because she wanted guys to see that she wore a thong when she went for practicality she went without anything her tongue pink against red lips flicking and teasing and hurting with their love her red lips only smiling when they were wrapped around sin

6611855 one of the very first experiences sunil gavaskar had was during the indian tour of australia in 1977 when bishen singh bedi was captain of the indian cricket team during the three day match against victoria sunil slipped on the ground while fielding and tore a muscle in his thigh it turned out to be a severe injury in those days the indian team did not have a physiotherapist traveling with them so sunils injury was shown to the home teams physiotherapist after he was examined sunil was informed that it was a severely torn muscle and he would be out of the game for the next six weeks this was a big blow as the next test match was starting within a weeks time sunil was in excruciating pain and unable to stand or put any pressure on the right leg he phoned pammi his wife in india and informed her about this development pammi immediately told him apply sathya sai babas vibhuti sunil said that he had none with him ill send you some right away apply it in the affected area im sure it will work she replied the prospect of sunil being fit enough to play for the next test which was four days away seemed a total impossibility so he was not picked for that particular match in the test squad in the meanwhile sushil doshi one of the hindi commentators of all india radio happened to be leaving for australia pammi arranged to send babas vibhuti through him sushil doshi arrived two days prior to the test match in brisbane and handed over the vibhuti packet to sunil sunil who was still hobbling around with that painful leg immediately applied almost half of the vibhuti packet on the affected area hoping for a miracle
6611856 after i started applying vibhuti there was marked improvement and on the eve of the test match i requested the team management not to rule me out but to have a fitness test on the morning of the test match from barely being able to put weight on my leg i was able to walk comfortably in just two days but there was a stiff soreness that was worrying on the morning of the match i applied vibhuti to the leg and went to the ground that was going to be my first attempt to try and run after a gap of eight days even as i stepped on to the ground to give my fitness trial i realised that the stiffness was almost gone at the queensland cricket ground in those days you had to descend a few steps to the ground and it was these few steps which were painful previously and i had to walk down gingerly but on this day i felt confident enough getting down these steps normally i took a light jog around the ground and with every stride i could feel the soreness going away though i did not do anything silly as a quick dash or sprint i felt confident enough to play in the test and so informed the management who accepted it and included me in the playing eleven it was unbelievable

6611884 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6611885 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose

6611889 there are too many other things that major league baseball can do to shorten games instant replay is not going to make that big a deal
6611890 its one play a week maybe where its a borderline home run call its not something thats going to slow down that many games

6611895 this was not a psi based impression or experience i recognize that this was just something my head has affected even if it is accurate it should not be considered data
6611896 this data is affected in some way by my mental processing but i believe the core of this was based on psi
6611897 this relates to something in the target but whatever it is is probably not this
6611898 this isnt psi based information and i am just venting it to get rid of it
6611899 what they feel is important or relevant about the target even stuff they imagine
6611900 look he doesnt even have a method hes just a natural

6611959 is one saved by faith alone or by faith and good works
6611960 take the case my brothers of someone who has never done a single good act but claims that he has faith will that faith save him if one of the brothers or one of the sisters is in need of clothes and has not enough food to live on and one of you says to them i wish you well keep yourself warm and eat plenty without giving them these bare necessities of llife then what good is that if good works do not go with it it is quite dead this is the way to talk to people of that kind you say you have faith and i have good deeds i will prove to you that i have faith by showing you my good deeds now you prove to me that you have faith without any good deeds to show you believe in one god that is creditable enough but the demons have the same belief and they tremble with fear do realise you senseless man that faith without works is useless you surely know that abraham our father was justified by his deed because he offered isaac on the altar there you see it faith and good deeds were working together his faith became perfect by what he did this is what scripture really means when it says abraham put his faith in god and this was counted as making him justified and that is why he was called the friend of god you see now that it is by doing something good and not only by believing that a man is justified
6611961 why do you call me lord lord and not do what i say

6612072 technology has changed rapidly we know that social conditions in singapore have changed and people want greater space for expression
6612073 so the current laws that govern political discourse online are dated and they need to be updated so thats one part
6612074 the more problematic part is how do we in the process of opening up come up with some ways of reducing minimising if not cut it off completely this abuse of this technology
6612075 if our proposals are accepted i think itll be quite a major step in terms of opening up the space for political participation we have spent an awful lot of time working on this we are reasonably pleased with what weve done but we dont have a monopoly
6612076 i hope the general public will step forward and robustly scrutinise what we are suggesting and find ways to help us improve on our ideas this cannot be the final chapter of the saga i think there would probably be a need to further review whatever changes that are made a few years down the road

6612081 the crystal is a neutral object whose inner structure exhibits a state of perfection and balance
6612082 when its cut to the proper form and when the human mind enters into relationship with its structural perfection the crystal emits a vibration which extends and amplifies the powers of the human mind like a laser it radiates energy in a coherent highly concentrated form and this energy may be transmitted into objects or people at will
6612083 the psychic healer has to deal with the emanations of his hand or his bioenergy field which do not have the same levels of coherence one can obtain by using a crystal the crystal works much the same way that a laser does it takes scattered rays of energy and makes the energy field so coherent and unidirectional that a tremendous force is generated one that is much stronger than if the energies were allowed to be emitted without having come into coherence
6612084 economists have predicted the last 15 out of nine recessions
6612085 greedy greedy people screw human suffering its about how the sick can make you feel all tingly
6612086 i want to say lets not judge him he is oviouslly not well but for a different reason we all have parayed for so why stop praying i tonight will pray for him to get help and i pray he will be forgiven
6612087 praying for mike and the people who are affected by this his friends family and countless others who trusted mike just remember that the word says in psalm 118 8 to trust in god and not man why because were all fallible no one is perfect im not making excuses for mike i dont know the man even if i did i dont truly know his heart the way god does none of us do but i do believe that we can exercise the same grace and mercy god shows us all the time despite our actions
6612088 so to me its a no brainer i would not be who i am today without mike and his family so even though i do not understand why or how this is possible and i may never get my answers i still pray for his family and him because i cannot imagine the pain confusion stress and humilitation they must all be suffering forgiveness is not about understanding why he has done this its much more if anyone knows this family and mike himself they will have no trouble forgiving and supporting because we all know what they would if it was reversed and we were in the wrong
6612089 i was under his teachings closely in the time he announced his sickness he talked alot about forgiveness not taking offence pride and giving everything to god and not battling in the flesh and things in the secret place being shouted from the roof im not a preacher or very good at putting my thoughts into words so i hope this comes out right but i think he was a man of god who was human like us and had one thing he struggled to deal with and battled it with his own strength but new what would be happening so prepared us by teaching us how to forgive and not be hurt

6612107 that model of a new world trade organization compatible fta with australia and nz could potentially be a disaster for the pacific
6612108 even supporters of a new fta acknowledge there will be high costs like job losses and reductions in government revenue this joint statement is calling on our leaders to ensure that there are alternatives and that trade arrangements with australia and new zealand should be based on justice and should enhance social development in the pacific
6612109 we know country towns in australia and new zealand are hurting because they cant find workers
6612110 and in our island countries we have willing workers temporary labor mobility schemes are mutually beneficial theyre a win win situation for australia nz and the pacific island countries they shouldnt be offered as a concession in free trade deals that will benefit australia and nz far more than the pacific island countries
6612111 for too long weve had studies from australia and new zealand focusing narrowly on the benefits of a new fta and ways to overcome the acknowledged adjustment costs
6612112 we need new research to assess potential alternatives to a wto compatible fta to assess the implications of a new fta for the pacifics environment natural resources land and cultures to assess the implications of a new fta for pacific legislation and to assess the loss of policy space available to pacific governments on signing a new fta

6612133 its apparent from those comments that obama d ill has a more positive view of the federal civil service than mccain r ariz does
6612134 obama is concerned by the rising number of government contractors that are often unaccountable and frequently less efficient than government workers
6612135 reduce our nations increasing dependence on private contractors in sensitive or inherently governmental functions

6612164 we didnt have the budget to invest and expand and even improve the site for a lot of years we were stuck and not even changing the features of the site
6612165 we felt we were doing ourselves an injustice by having an agency represent us we just werent getting the cut through we liked
6612166 we can do more beyond the banner ad approaches to our sales
6612167 what we are about is creating an office social network which is what our advertisers want by integrating all of these things we think we can increase peoples session times and have them staring at the screen longer
6612168 our aim is to become the biggest sports site in the country weve got a long way to go but we are clearly in the top five

6612177 they do not depict an actual american flag the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
6612178 its an upside down american flag which has always had a very specific meaning declaring it is anything else is a lie deflecting attention from it is a typical political maneuver falling for it is more proof of the dumbing down of the american voter

6612184 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend

6612189 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
6612190 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
6612191 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
6612192 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities

6612224 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6612225 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6612226 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6612227 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6612228 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt

6612250 windows xp users were generally happy with service pack 2
6612251 there was not a huge clamour for windows xp sp3 like there was for vista sp1 and that shows in the results its pretty clear that a lot of xp users are very content with sp2
6612252 they heavily promoted vista sp1 and went out of their way to put a good foot forward for it but they barely mentioned xp sp3
6612253 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6612254 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6612255 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6612256 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6612257 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6612258 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6612259 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6612260 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6612261 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo
6612262 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6612263 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6612264 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6612265 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6612266 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6612267 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps

6612289 but i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games

6612300 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week
6612301 were pretty committed to user choice but were also pretty ardent that firefox 3 0 is a good product
6612302 you can decline the update when its offered if you if dont want it
6612303 well start and make sure the mirror network is not overloaded
6612304 one thing we heard from users was whether there was a problem with firefox 2 0
6612305 theres been a good buzz around it and for people who have gotten firefox 2 0 its been a while since theyve had a major update

6612314 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6612315 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6612316 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6612317 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6612318 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6612319 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6612320 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6612321 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies

6612325 aliens are not going to attack the world trade center what reason would they attack the world trade center that makes no sense at all

6612335 the liberals say they want to face me at the next election
6612336 when they say that you know it is exactly the opposition
6612337 but people can see what we are doing on water and can see what was not done by the other mob
6612338 the point of the matter is that it winning the election will be very difficult and i said that at the party conference last weekend
6612339 do i have fears about that no because i think we have been doing a good job

6612358 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
6612359 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
6612360 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts

6612367 obviously thats true with him we werent sure what we were getting but hes been very durable hes taken a lot of snaps through training camp and preseason games hes stood up and kept going and hes going strong
6612368 its better than going out there saturday and getting the crowd noise and being shocked with it
6612369 i would like to get a lot more reps before we start the regular season but ive got to be smart
6612370 being ready for the season is the most important thing right now
6612371 our stance with todd is that if hes 100 percent were going to have him out on the field
6612372 so theres a good chance hell play if we dont have a setback between now and then
6612373 were studying that right now and we want to make sure we have it right because when they dont get the call then were not on the same page
6612374 dont worry we have enough dope to put down secretariat
6612375 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6612376 he felt really lonely and he wanted to be with his mother and family
6612377 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6612378 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors
6612379 if we design a scheme that makes businesses unviable the end result will be relocation of vital export earning industries to other countries this will cost australian jobs without any reduction in global emissions australia will simply reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by exporting them to other countries

6612385 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6612386 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6612387 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6612388 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6612389 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6612390 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6612391 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6612392 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6612393 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6612394 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6612395 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding

6612402 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
6612403 even if the federal and state versions had identical language they would have very different consequences the federal government doesnt have a law regulating abortion so congress could pass a born alive measure without actually affecting anything but illinois has an abortion law that would be muddled by changing the definition of a person with full rights

6612467 we have the plans in place to do them globally

6612488 the sangharsh samiti urged the local congress leaders to impress upon their high command leading the ruling upa regime headed by dr manmohan singh to concede the demand of restoration of land to the sasb or otherwise these leaders may resign from the party and join the mass movement
6612489 the contradiction between approach of the local congress leaders of jammu and policies of their high command are creating misconception about the role of local party leaders and creating a situation of mistrust and conflict in this scenario if any mishap or clash takes place during the protests or demonstrations the responsibility shall lie on the local and the central leadership of the congress party
6612490 samiti in jammu and separatists in kashmir as two faces of the same coin
6612491 while the local congress leaders are rendering their support their centre leadership is turning a blind eye to this movement of nationalist people and its comparison to the secessionist activity of the hurriyat in kashmir is shameful

6612504 21 of the states 80 districts were affected by rain and floods that had left 674 villages marooned and more than 1 5 million people were displaced

6612522 honestly it was unreal to me you hear the words all the time but i really couldnt fathom it its like a storybook ending its something you see in hollywood a fairy tale and yet it was playing out
6612523 and my life doesnt play out that way all the time you know theres been a lot of hardships i was just hoping this one time it would really come through
6612524 honestly that was wishful thinking i knew it was a long road a long journey and i knew it was too perfect of an ending to actually happen nothing ever goes right with my family and my life so this was too perfect and i cant really swallow it right now

6612526 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
6612527 i feel good about them i dont see any significant difference right now in this defense to last years or the year before certainly it is logical to say they are inexperienced and it will take them awhile and it might but when you look at the leadership of fowler bauman nixon jorgensen i think it will end up being another good defense
6612528 there could be one that we could give today but i dont see any need to do it before game week and if there needs to be a few more days of evaluation at any position that could happen so monday most likely would be a reasonable day to do that

6612579 hey crusher good match ill give it to you i guess itll be you and i in the tv title match than but what you dont know is that the mayor here convinced the napw brass to reschedule the television title match from next weeks show
6612580 so crusher i hope you got some left in you because the napw brass think itll be good for business when rex caliber tv champion
6612581 he looks up at the man now straightens himself level to the man to speak
6612582 he points over his shoulder as he sees crusher running at full speed towards him
6612583 but the camera man disobeys him and gets in the crushers way of running crusher seems a little aggravated by him but stops as he really doesnt want to hurt the man
6612584 the camera man is clearly frightened by him as he is shaking he looks at the crushers big frame and he feels overpowered already
6612585 this gets a laugh from kurt and he doesnt know whether to laugh or stay serious as he cracks a fake smile

6612590 hey a 3d fighting game thats awesome i sure wish we could make one of those

6612592 youve got the dumbkopf military clown mccain hes too old
6612593 obama is real hard for an individual to vote for
6612594 why experience and race i dont want to sugarcoat it
6612595 there was a lot to be said for both of them obama has the ability to inspire which is something i think this nation truly needs but hillary is a known quantity
6612596 the last couple presidential races weve had these huge issues that have drawn out people
6612597 weve got a lot of people moving in who are commuting to the cities and tend to be a little more conservative voters
6612598 we walked into the room and you could just feel the energy
6612599 every since then i was like this guys got something special
6612600 its shocking but ive been surprised at the number of people ive encountered around here who will say im not ready to vote for a black person
6612601 i like his position on national security primarily and the fact that hes pro life
6612602 i think hes an inexperienced guy trying to fill a position that hes really not qualified for
6612603 the fact that his father was a muslim and he was raised muslim in his early childhood years that plays a factor
6612604 any president i vote for has to be a christian i dont think its a prejudice so much its just that i think our values are different
6612605 obama i think still fluctuates because hes on a learning curve
6612606 but once youre in it you have to deal with the cards that you are dealt and i think mccains probably the best one to bring it to a reasonable ending
6612607 i think they should both be on the ticket i think wed have the best of both worlds
6612608 if he doesnt get in that will be the only reason
6612609 hes just a new and a different face and people are sort of swooning
6612610 there is no excuse for party elites who believe they have more power than the grassroots
6612611 if we allow that to continue our freedoms are taken away from us and we are ruled by a group of elitists
6612612 i didnt know exactly where he stood on some of the value issues
6612613 the way he answered those questions it showed a depth of character to me that i hadnt realized before
6612614 he also answered them very straight forward no hesitation as to what he believed
6612615 i think he is very intelligent a very moving speaker
6612616 i think he believes in socialism and wants to move the country to become a socialist country
6612617 a slave is a man that waits on another to set him free
6612618 our boys are studs and can knock you out with a look
6612619 we went there without much expectation and it turned out we have a lot of fans here in thailand we were shocked when they sang along with us during our showcase performances we have a tight schedule here we are not feeling tired and is advancing smoothly
6612620 russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic channels
6612621 now youll really have something to tell her when you call her back
6612622 i hope your wife wasnt watching on tv when you just said that
6612623 i would divorce her if i was your brother and found out my wife just slept with your husband
6612624 from what i can make of it he had for 11 days no food and no shelter for three days he was on his back unable to move and being attacked by flies and mosquitoes and all sorts of nasty creatures
6612625 but he is an experienced hiker hes a surfer and plays tennis so he is fit and these things are going to keep him alive
6612626 there were complications we turned your son into a bumbling retard all hell be able to do is say his name
6612627 theyre exhausted im staying until rodrigo gets here to spend the night
6612628 the doctors kept you doped up on vicodin and some kind of forgetting medicine they said the pain is too much at the beginning its funny
6612629 i helped a nurse give you a bed bath and when i turned you you screamed you have betrayed me you traitor at me
6612630 i brought your laptop and the lord of the rings
6612631 not right now no its more like a dull pain
6612632 were gonna have to gradually take you off the morphine and start you on methodone
6612633 im going down to the cafeteria to eat ill be right back your aunt will stay with you
6612634 your mom is tired and shes been with you everyday let her go eat ill be here with you
6612635 wake up youve been asking me to use the ambu bag all morning
6612636 hey can you pick up a black ink cartridge on the way home
6612637 but i never noticed the printouts fading or streaking ah well its only about 30 for a new one wait 30
6612638 is a classic loss leader way of getting you hooked on a product by offering it free or almost free so big companies give away the razors or printers knowing in a few months youll be back to buy the overpriced blades or ink cartridges
6612639 give me a new ink cartridge or im going on strike
6612640 i think there are a lot of people out there in the industry who want to know that the government has handled it in the correct way
6612641 i think that it is a valid response but the main thing is research we dont know enough about the virus
6612642 were seeing really good work there with health and biosecurity there in queensland but we probably need to look at that more across a national framework and get that coordination happening at a national level and not just for things that are current but into the future
6612643 it may be that hendra will go away and we never see it again it may be that it could increase we just dont know
6612644 we need more information we need more research and analysis
6612645 kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6612646 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6612647 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6612648 weve just got to do everything we talked about all along
6612649 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6612650 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6612651 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6612652 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment
6612653 again unfortunately this is a koala that has been bashed to death and then after its dead they removed its leg
6612654 the profiles of serious violent criminals overwhelmingly list cruelty to animals before progression to people
6612655 the rspca is absolutely right in calling for tougher penalties to be enforced and to point out the longest sentence for cruelty handed down by queensland courts is just four months jail
6612656 these shocking acts of cruelty against koalas their joeys and birds must be stopped and the only way to stop them is to catch the perpetrators and ensure they receive the maximum penalties for cruelty
6612657 what is required is an international response including all emitters
6612658 in the absence of global action australia must ensure its actions do not unnecessarily impact on its economy and living conditions
6612659 the nations peak business group has joined the growing chorus across australian industry warning the rudd government that local companies will close and move offshore unless it fundamentally rethinks its proposed emissions trading scheme
6612660 a real world analysis of the impact of the governments plans based on 14 companies that opened their books for the business council of australia revealed that even with the governments proposed compensation three firms would face a carbon cost so high they would close
6612661 the future of a further two of the 14 companies drawn from hard hit sectors such as aluminium refining cement manufacturing petroleum refining steel making sugar milling and zinc and nickel refining would be extremely bleak
6612662 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6612663 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6612664 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6612665 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6612666 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6612667 playboy has always done classy portfolios so im sure if this was real its something that would be considered

6612682 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6612683 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6612684 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia

6612711 this election to me is going to define fairhopes future and we need to get it right
6612712 thats why im doing my homework i think citizens need to do more homework of their own to understand the process and to make the best choices

6612720 how the hell am i supposed to explain this to the head ship
6612721 i dont know some of the guys thought it was earth
6612722 earth come on thats where humans live i cant believe that all the broadcasts from earth show a planet with rivers and oceans and forests
6612723 those reports could be millions of years old we dont even know where earth is
6612724 but all the stories i heard about earth growing up make it seem like a paradise
6612725 well i dont know thats just what some of the rumors were you know how the guys like to talk

6612729 well we could either write a single post together and post it on both our blogs or we could each write a post on a similar theme and just link to each other
6612730 i like the co author idea we always have a good banter going this will be easy
6612731 we could write about how were alike and were both introspective and stuff
6612732 ooh yeah and we could tell everyone how were really brother and sister
6612733 was not a tax resident of any country and therefore the payment was free of tax
6612734 maybe i have more opportunities as a designer over there but im making a bigger statement over here
6612735 in the same way that ralph lauren stands for america chanel for france and versace for italy i want aschobi to stand for african fashion
6612736 i know this is the last place youd expect to find haute couture but i want to replace all of this darkness of the past with beauty
6612737 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6612738 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6612739 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6612740 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands odi squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6612741 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6612742 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6612743 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6612744 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6612745 it was a terrible day and we couldnt be in a harder position in this game
6612746 we have seriously got to up our game in all departments for the next two days
6612747 sloppyangel com brings exciting new fashion concepts trendy art and luxurious jewelry to the mainstream global community
6612748 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6612749 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6612750 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
6612751 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
6612752 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
6612753 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity

6612765 i used this deep mediterranean blue all over this room on the walls on the moldings on the cabinets even on the floor with a carpet in the same tone by using it so completely it makes the different planes all blend into each other the color unifies the space and blows out the boundaries youre swept away by the blue and have no sense of the size of the room
6612766 i painted my own apartment super white and when i walk in it just clears my brain and makes me feel lighter white reflects the light and makes the walls go away so a small space seems larger some whites are blue some are pink some are green but this is just white in its purest form without any color yet its not stark or cold just light and airy
6612767 im a great believer in disintegrating the edges of a small room by going dark and mysterious this is a fantastic deep gray flannel that would be even more effective if you used it in high gloss to reflect the light and create more spatial magic pair it with crisp white moldings and white furnishings with accents of powder pink pale blue lavender or mint green
6612768 shadow can be your friend especially in a small space painting a room a dark color camouflages the fact that its small a deep blue like this creates the perception of depth the green in it warms it up and reminds me of those glazes on english aesthetic movement pottery lacquer it if you want more liveliness
6612769 this is a soothing sand color that expands a space and creates a feeling of warmth and continuity especially if you use it on the ceiling and the walls i like the way it takes on the color of the light coming in and yet keeps its own integrity its the perfect backdrop the neutral walls recede and you focus more on the furnishings than on the size of the room
6612770 if you paint a room aubergine it instantly gives you a feeling of luxury its very rich very regal with a bit of mystery the perimeter blurs which makes a room feel bigger and more cavernous i used this in my own living room and i like the way it changes with the light during the day its deep deep purple and at night it looks more brown i love it with gray and any metallic fabric
6612771 this is a celadon y silvery mercurial color that i cant really define it reminds me of the ocean on a calm day when it goes right into the sky somehow it just creates an expansive feeling in me raspberry would be lovely with it punch it up with sunflower yellow or keep it very quiet with whites silvers and maybe a touch of turquoise
6612772 everybody thinks whites going to do it but it doesnt this is a pale yellow with a little twist of green its the next best thing to sitting outside in a garden its like sunshine and any room looks bigger when its streaming with sunlight great with black painted furniture and tangerine red or lime green
6612773 when i think expansive i immediately think of the sky this is a color that projects air and light it has the luminosity of the sky and that airy infinite quality clean and fresh and cloudlike the chip looks white but on the wall it can turn into the palest blue its a color with a lot of movement it catches other colors and reflects them
6612774 choose a color for the walls that you see outside it will give you a sense that the room continues beyond the windows in the country it might be this crisp green the green of stems in the garden and leaves on the trees green is a color that makes me feel alive it elevates your spirit which is going to make any room feel larger i see it with browns creams terra cotta persimmon
6612775 as my father always said a small room will look bigger if you paint it dark the corners will be cast in shadow and youre not quite sure where they are if youre scared to go really dark this is a mid tone taupe that allows you to hedge your bets its interesting sometimes it looks gray and sometimes it looks brown pair it with anything from navy blue to hot pink thats how versatile it is
6612776 lets get this show on the road its bed time translation me time

6612819 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers however significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs yarls wood must seek to meet these concerns but they are ultimately issues for the uk border agency which must urgently address them

6612911 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time

6613002 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6613003 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6613004 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops

6613028 uhuh sure i suppose you could already talk and walk and put on your own clothes and cook the family dinner at seven month old right
6613029 its true my parents always bragged about how i stopped wearing diapers at six months old so why cant your son stop wearing diapers when he is almost three years old

6613032 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6613033 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6613034 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6613035 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6613036 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6613037 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6613038 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6613039 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6613040 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6613041 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6613042 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks

6613047 congratulations to ils on another successful proton launch the f3 launch has been highly anticipated this satellite will enable inmarsat to complete its bgan services to subscribers across the globe
6613048 we thank ils for its due diligence in returning to flight successfully
6613049 we are expecting the sample to look similar to previous samples
6613050 one of the things well be looking for is an oxygen release indicative of perchlorate
6613051 we want to know the structure and composition of the soil at the surface at the ice and in between to help answer questions about the movement of water either as vapor or liquid between the icy layer and the surface
6613052 while we are disappointed that nasa terminated our contract we believe in their process and support their decision we are pleased the gao has dismissed the protest we look forward to submitting a limited final proposal revision as required by nasa and to a timely contract award
6613053 we remain confident our offering will continue to be judged as the best value to the government our world class and highly experienced contractor team offered an innovative and comprehensive solution to develop and produce the next spacesuit for nasa we remain fully committed and prepared to meet all requirements of the constellation spacesuit program
6613054 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6613055 my clear favorites are the two tools that make the stis or space
6613056 we humans control the evolution of our tools and the goddard space flight center has stepped up the pace of that evolution for this last hubble repair mission we have created many tools to make never before repairs to instruments
6613057 its a bit of an art learning how to drive across dry lake beds at great speed
6613058 the good thing about having it attached to the truck is that if you miss the dust devil you can quickly pick up the instruments and chase it down again
6613059 but chasing just gives you more information about dust devils
6613060 the big thing about this project is were not just going in and measuring dust devils
6613061 we want to be measuring the ambient meteorology at the same time so having two different test areas gives us two different climatic regions to study
6613062 i really like going into the field and chasing dust devils

6613066 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president
6613067 how can we possibly tell millions of americans who registered to vote who came to the polls in record numbers to simply get over it and move on

6613073 we all want to help women who cant afford a mammogram to fight it

6613075 every week were getting better and better and i think part of that is because we cheer each other on

6613079 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6613080 art music and activism dont have to be mutually exclusive
6613081 you dont have to just go onstage and preach and hope that people go out and do something
6613082 we want to get people active as well as get people to talk with each other we want there to be some productive conversations and some good things happening in general
6613083 all working on the same basic premise theyre not working on it in the same exact ways were all out there for the same reason
6613084 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6613085 our goal is to put on the best convention possible to put our best foot forward
6613086 they said that if you are already a member of the black chamber you automatically were considered a preferred vendor and would be listed
6613087 no one ever asked for a list of our members apparently they made no effort to be inclusive
6613088 we were looking at providing a mobile registration solution for the republican national committee to speed up the delegate check in process i called three or four times within a two week period but never got a call back
6613089 i sincerely hope there is still interest in using my work
6613090 please let me know the next steps that i can take to bring this to fruition
6613091 there is no excuse that this consideration of her publication didnt happen
6613092 both convention bureaus people talked about getting on this preferred businesses list
6613093 i think they had that big meeting to show people hey we reached out to the community now its up to them what they do with it
6613094 as far as i was concerned it was a way to get people to pay 425 to become a member of the different convention and visitors bureaus
6613095 if they really wanted diversity you can go to the black pages and find restaurants
6613096 you can work with those communities of color but you have to have someone dedicated to making sure that they do that
6613097 just dont do it by having a meeting and saying come to me at this certain time you actually have to do some outreach
6613098 if your goal is to make an outreach to a particular segment hispanic asian black and your goal is to reach out to that segment then the onus is on you
6613099 but if i want to say that i am mightier than god sit back and whoever comes to me maybe we throw some business their way if thats the attitude chances are there are not going to be a lot of minority owned businesses that are going to come to you
6613100 to try to get to the power players of the republican national convention
6613101 thats not right we should have diversity in everything we the republican party do
6613102 from blacks who are coming from out of town to the convention wanting to know where can they go to get their hair done where to go to get some soul food where can they go to church where can they find beauty products or where can they find places of special interest to them
6613103 it never occurred to them that somebody might need something different from the mainstream
6613104 we will be in the position to direct people looking for different cultures et cetera
6613105 i think lots of people will be visiting the twin cities because of the convention but may not necessarily be on the convention floor
6613106 the convention opens on a monday and some people will come for the weekend beforehand or they will stay after the convention ends and use this as part of their vacation i also think that not only the delegates will be coming but they might bring their families who wont be at the convention but will be out in the community wanting to spend money
6613107 my hope is that black businesses in our community will see that type of benefit
6613108 we are going to see when this is all over with just how much money they brought to the black community
6613109 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6613110 when i look out my window i can see all the way down the street now
6613111 i havent been able to do that in more than 30 years living here
6613112 we assess the condition inside and out we estimate the cost of rehab and we estimate the value of the home after rehab we are very critical and discerning
6613113 thats where the guy lived who killed the pizza guy a couple of years ago and that house there 2914 dupont one time they were outside with big guns but the city doesnt do anything until its too late until its reached a crisis point
6613114 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6613115 i think she requested that she play with us to teach us something shes a terrific golfer but much more importantly shes a terrific person and we really enjoyed her company
6613116 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6613117 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6613118 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6613119 and we dont have a lot of time to be building things
6613120 the debt is selling right now because the bond market thinks the government is going to step in and take over
6613121 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6613122 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6613123 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there

6613129 most american leaders since world war ii have felt a need to demonstrate their willingness to shed blood to protect or advance what they construe as the national interest
6613130 has shown him as a man capable of bold action
6613131 strength but instead by proving that they too want to prosecute wars just perhaps in different places or with different tactics as chairman of the foreign relations committee in 2002 biden also voted to authorize the attack on iraq

6613135 my 10 year experience with the mngop has left me with the view that its extremely difficult for a pro choice or pro gay civil union member of the republican party to advance to any stage of leadership in this state let alone delegate to the rnc indeed it can be difficult at times even to keep hold on ones very credibility once word of such a liberal stance gets out

6613154 france is resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty
6613155 i dont have any doubt about that we have to be here
6613156 and how many troops do we need to achieve those objectives
6613157 it is the afghans themselves who need to provide security for afghans and not an operation of occupation
6613158 our soldiers should not get themselves killed for uncle sam
6613159 they died in an endless war that the united states is waging in this country in its own interests
6613160 falling into the trap of taliban who want to shake our resolve with their recent spectacular action
6613161 at this time of suffering it seems to us that national unity in the face of the terrorism that threatens us should prevail
6613162 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6613163 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here
6613164 this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6613165 if it had to be done again i would do it
6613166 condolences and the pain of the afghan people to the french people for the loss they have suffered
6613167 rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6613168 the worst would have been if this ambush had occured in kapissa a few kilometers to the north that is where nicolas sarkozy sent a contingent of 700 men placed under american command
6613169 the attack on the french contingent will be a disappointment for the elysee a reference to sarkozys office the french white house since the spring the risk that the military was running in this eastern zone where the jihadists are regrouping was both anticipated and feared
6613170 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
6613171 a type of stew widely eaten in west africa including ghana liberia sierra leone and nigeria the word palaver comes from the portuguese language and means a talk lengthy debate or quarrel it is unclear how this led to the name of the stew one theory is that when the stew was first made with long ropey greens people would start quarrels by slapping each other with the greens from their stew

6613173 since late april or the beginning of may weve cleaned up graffiti on lake street from the target store at the minnehaha mall to west river road two or three times
6613174 about a year and half ago we started a huge mural project to get the whole community involved especially at risk kids
6613175 were getting to the point where almost every alley in our neighborhood has been covered
6613176 taggers want a big open space and a mural takes that away plus i think the gangs who are responsible for a lot of the graffiti tend to respect work that comes from the community
6613177 we did a great mural project a few saturdays ago
6613178 near lake street and longfellow avenue where most of our volunteers were latino kids that lived on the block
6613179 people see us on the street and ask to be put on
6613180 the corcoran mural project was awarded with council member gary schiffs neighborhood project of the year this february
6613181 i was really surprised because we were competing with projects from throughout the 9th ward

6613183 nowhere on the website could i find any indication of who is actually behind these journals
6613184 sji sometimes speaks of itself as a publisher of journals plural and sometimes of one multi disciplinary journal singular
6613185 the fact that some of the lead authors of articles are using lycos and aol as email addresses really raises alarms
6613186 dr niaz the founder of sji is also well aware of the realities of prejudice and racism and knows how to deal with them with legal actions

6613189 tahun cahaya merupakan satuan jarak yang digunakan untuk mengukur jarak mungkin banyak orang ketika mendengar kata tahun cahaya akan berpikir tentang satuan waktu ketimbang jarak karena ada kata tahun yang biasanya memang digunakan untuk menandakan waktu namun demikian dalam astronomi tahun cahaya digunakan sebagai penanda jarak pada umumnya yang kita ketahui sebagai penanda jarak adalah meter kilometer mil inci atau centimeter namun jika para astronom dengan teleskopnya menlihat bintang keadaan menjadi berbeda dari apa yang kita ketahui di bumi jarak yang ditemui sangatlah besar bahkan untuk jarak bumi dengan bintang terdekatnya selain matahari mencapai 38 000 000 000 000 kilometers nah itu bintang yang terdekat sementara masih ada banyak sekali bintang yang jaraknya jutaan kali lebih jauh dari jarak tersebut jika kita mulai berpikir tentang perbedaan jarak yang besar tersebut maka sangat tidak praktis kalau satuan kilometer meter mil masih tetap digunakan sebagai penanda jarak mengapa apakah tidak relevan satuan jarak tersebut masih sangat relevan tapi peningkatan angkanya sudah terlampau besar kita tidak berbicara tentang jarak 10 km atau 10000 km melainkan milyaran km dan tidak ada seorang pun yang mau berbicara sambil mengingat 20 digit angka atau menuliskan 20 digit angka tersebut maka untuk mengukur jarak yang sangat besar digunakan satuan tahun cahaya cahaya bergerak 300 000 km per detik maka detik cahaya light second setara dengan jarak 300 000 km nah tahun cahaya adalah jarak yang dapat ditempuh cahaya dalam waktu satu tahun ketika melewati ruang hampa udara atau 300 000 km detik x 60 detik menit x 60 menit jam x 24 jam hari x 365 25 hari tahun 9 467 280 000 000 km 9 46 1012 km maka satu tahun cahaya setara dengan 9 467 280 000 000 km 9 46 1012 km jarak yang sangat jauh

6613192 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6613193 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6613194 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6613195 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6613196 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6613197 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6613208 no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of wtc 7 or reported by witnesses
6613209 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6613210 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6613211 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6613212 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6613213 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6613231 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6613232 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6613233 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6613234 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark

6613246 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6613247 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
6613248 he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
6613249 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
6613250 according to recent allegations in your capacity as the former cia deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the near east division you were tasked by former cia director george tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the white house stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written
6613251 given your reported direct knowledge of these events i am requesting that you contact judiciary committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter

6613256 the framerate just cant keep up with all thats being thrown on the screen and it tanks far below 30 frames more often than it can stay there or above it theres hope for the game being 60 frames per second at the start of a level but once the camera swoops in to look at the lay of the land in front of you it kicks to 30 and below and that becomes incredibly noticeable when sonics zipping at light speed and the screen refresh chunks up so bad its nearly unwatchable
6613257 so when the moon comes out sonic wolfs out to match the darkness and the gameplay changes to highlight the other side of sonic turning the dash as fast as you can design into a combo heavy brawler with prince of persia like platforming wait what
6613258 its an idea that seems like an incredible reach for the character a concept thats completely tacked on for no other reason than to give the game its own hook just to say its different than the other sonic games and then when you see sonic attack enemies or grab ledges with limbs that spring outwards like a stretch armstrong doll well its hard to turn your brain off when that happens it just looks dumb

6613598 the only way theyre going to turn the ship around is bringing to market compelling products that are competitively priced
6613599 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6613600 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6613601 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6613602 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6613603 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6613604 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6613605 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6613606 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
6613607 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
6613608 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant
6613609 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6613610 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6613611 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6613612 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal

6613615 n r vi sammenligner den juridiske og sociale position af kvinder i mesopotamien og j diske samfund noterer vi os den strenge regulering af kvinders seksualitet og i institutionaliseringen af seksuel dobbeltmoral i lovkoderne
6613616 tiden for staternes grundl ggelse l s skabelsen af civilisationen var tidspunktet der understregede familien som samfundets grundl ggende enhed ligesom dagens sociale og seksuelle anarki er tiden der understreger kvinders nske om at skrotte familien og returnere til
6613617 inkorporerede alle princippet om at den uforrettede part er husbonden eller faderen til den voldtagne kvinde

6613623 carroll will portray the internationally recognized heroine for the next year with her first appearances to be made promoting the latest installment to the gaming franchise tomb raider underworld which ships on november 2008
6613624 this is a fantastic opportunity and i look forward to embracing laras world
6613625 its unbelievable how realistic her movements are in tomb raider underworld and its so gratifying to be able to use my years of gymnastic training to portray such a beloved character
6613626 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6613627 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6613628 officers from the specialist and economic crimes unit are currently meeting with pa consulting to review the circumstances of the loss by their member of staff there is no investigation at this stage

6613648 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
6613649 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
6613650 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
6613651 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
6613652 everything ive ever done has taken me longer than i thought it would
6613653 i agree wholeheartedly with arthur adler s comments for the most part although im skeptical that youll see much demand shifting to emerging markets which still depend on the same debt sources as developed markets except for the me middle east which is a pure equity market awash with liquidity
6613654 initially the drop off was due to the collapse in the financing markets then as commodity prices particularly oil spiked most lodging participants including financing sources believed that revenues for 2008 and 2009 will be way down making it very difficult to finance deals even at lower leverage levels
6613655 is there a simple test that can be used to quickly determine an executives leadership ability
6613656 why is the food suddenly so dirty that it has to be irradiated
6613657 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6613658 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6613659 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6613660 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6613661 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6613662 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left

6613668 we would like to reassure all concerned that the safety and lives of our crew members are of utmost priority to us mob attack on photographers police say they are not out to tarnish pkrs image
6613669 there were just so many people but i didnt see any police which got me worried
6613670 i said to a colleague lets go for a walk because i did not want to stay in one spot for too long
6613671 then we saw a pick up truck filled with people and they started beating the bn supporters and this was when the photographer sairien got up on a pick up to take photos
6613672 suddenly somebody pulled him down and he fell to the ground people started stomping him and his camera was taken
6613673 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
6613674 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

6613676 we are so enthusiastic about setting out for gaza on the way today we had the cypriot authorities escorting us now its time for the world to escort us to gaza
6613677 to draw attention to the devastating consequences of the israeli blockade
6613678 the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza
6613679 the israeli authorities will ensure that the shipment reaches its destination via the land crossing points
6613680 is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
6613681 the worst scenario would be that israeli forces sink our boats and arrest us but most likely they will tow our boats to israel and arrest us
6613682 the beauty of a nonviolent activity is that we always win if we break the siege and reach gaza we win and even if they arrest us we also win because this will expose the face of the occupation and prove that israel is still an occupier in gaza
6613683 ordinary people have often played key roles in history particularly in situations like this where governments shirk their responsibilities
6613684 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
6613685 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6613686 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6613687 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law
6613688 and i was like ive done modeling in the past and there was never been nothing like that before
6613689 new zealand is committed to providing practical support to pacific island countries and communities who must respond and adapt to environment
6613690 you cant be a one dimensional player a lot of one dimensional players will leave a lot faster than the guy who can do a lot of different things
6613691 i can run i can catch and i can block i think thats the reason why the broncos brought me over here
6613692 im not a natural fullback but at the same time im stronger than most fullbacks
6613693 physically i go in there and i can slam into a linebacker but im really a runner thats what i do coming out of the backfield and catch some balls
6613694 but ill do whatever my coaches ask me to do i wont complain about it ill just go out there and just do my job pound for pound im probably one of the strongest guys on the team
6613695 fullbacks are usually slower they take longer to read pittman flies right in there he hits whoever
6613696 thats my type i like somebody thats just going to go all out
6613697 its just an adjustment for me its just another step in my career this is my 11th year and im excited to do a lot of new things so like i said if the coach asks me to do it i just go out there and i have fun doing it
6613698 i really dont like lead blocking too much but i go in there and ill do it just catching passes its a mismatch me against a linebacker 1 on 1 i can really take advantage of a linebacker
6613699 and physically thats a mismatch too because physically they cant cover me so theres a lot of things i can bring to the table in the passing game so i will say just really coming out of the backfield
6613700 i have never heard of any mp in sabah switching to pkr they have learned from past mistakes and experiences that the move will never benefit them and the rakyat
6613701 it will only delay development in the state and hamper efforts to eradicate poverty especially in rural areas
6613702 sabah mps have had very bad experiences before i believe all sabah mps will remain with bn through thick and thin i know pkr vice president datuk dr jeffrey kitingan just too well
6613703 this is just a dirty and silly tactic by the opposition to win support for anwar
6613704 believe me whatever is said by jeffrey will never take place as the mps there will stick with the coalition
6613705 in fact the umno division is giving me great support and we are working closely as a team
6613706 it is just that i believe in going out on my own to meet voters so that the people can talk to me and voice their concerns and problems
6613707 one of the lessons that we learnt in the march general election was that the voters were not comfortable having a big entourage accompanying the candidate as this prevents them from having a personal encounter
6613708 that is the reason we are adopting this strategy unlike parti keadilan rakyat that believes in going out in big groups to show that they command strong support
6613709 we have found that some of these people attending the ceramah are an artificial crowd brought in from outside
6613710 this is pkrs tactic to show that the voters are supportive of them
6613711 my confidence is based on the results of the march general election and from the feedback obtained by my campaign team we just need to put in more effort to ensure that this becomes a reality
6613712 he is interpreting it wrongly i grew up with the chinese i am half malay and half chinese i understand the culture and the beliefs of the chinese community
6613713 i first started feeling the pain at around the six kilometre mark but i was determined to go on
6613714 at the 14 kilometre mark the pain became unbearable and try as i did i just couldnt continue i know i have disappointed the country but please understand that this was beyond my control
6613715 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
6613716 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

6613719 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
6613720 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6613721 endeavouring to cause prospective defendants to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
6613722 there is a cloud over the vice president and that cloud remains because the defendant libby obstructed justice
6613723 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
6613724 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
6613725 were starting our work and then were doing it in a period where congress is in recess im calling everybody back
6613726 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
6613727 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
6613728 president bush underwrote mr musharrafs dictatorship but it said nothing of the example bush himself has set in such matters including rigging elections as musharraf did

6613731 we are coming together to showcase our talents through this festival
6613732 we want jaya one to be known as a platform for independent artists to showcase their works
6613733 the art exhibition will run until october featuring works from 30 artists and art collectives
6613734 we love this place and will definitely be back for more
6613735 in some corporate environments there is brand linking opportunities so if you have the appropriate handbag or if you wear the same shoes as the ceo people will recognize theres a person on the move
6613736 over giftwrapping yourself is potentially distracting from the thing you are trying to draw attention to you
6613737 dressing for comfort is never appropriate for work its not about making you feel comfortable there are ways to do that in the
6613738 all five have an equal chance of winning what is most important at this stage is picking the right song and making it the contestants very own
6613739 the man has the right to make a statement like that
6613740 its up to us we understand the scheme all we have to do is execute it
6613741 i dont put pressure on him and say if we dont win 11 games
6613742 there are so many variables such as injuries and bad luck you cant say if we dont do this this is going to happen
6613743 it was evident we had two bad years especially last year and he needed to make some changes
6613744 its like any business youve got to stay abreast of whats happening and stay current
6613745 i always study the top five top 10 every season offense defense organization special teams i enjoy football so i keep on top of new trends and whats happening
6613746 and mike studies all the time thats how you keep up with the game thats how he stays a step ahead
6613747 i think anybody thats in this profession always understands theyre in the hot seat
6613748 thats the nature of this game the reason you stay with the job that you have is because you win and if you dont win you dont keep your job
6613749 i think its even stronger now than it was when i was younger because you realize youre just on top of so many factors that exist and because youre 10 15 20 years older
6613750 you understand the highs and lows and what it takes to stay on top and how important these games are
6613751 its not just missing the playoffs its what kind of product are you putting on the field youre 7 9 and we didnt play well i took it very personal made some changes some tough changes and they were changes i had to make
6613752 when you predict you should win 10 games every year and you dont it comes down to me i always believe we should be in the playoffs like i said i believe well be in the playoffs this year if we stay healthy i think well get there
6613753 we have taken chances on players in the past and we will in the future
6613754 but they understand that weve got a certain standard here and if you dont meet that standard youre gone very quickly
6613755 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it
6613756 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6613757 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6613758 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6613759 obviously this injury is one of those things you have to kind of handle daily
6613760 i continue to monitor it because ideally i want to be at full strength come the opener
6613761 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6613762 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6613763 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6613764 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6613765 the constitution isnt like other laws rob law is the government telling us what were forbidden from doing the constitution is the people telling the government telling me what im allowed to do the motion wasnt on the list the people wont let us do it
6613766 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
6613767 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6613768 that was the same way he operated as an executive
6613769 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6613770 that was the same way he operated as an executive

6613772 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
6613773 during warm ups his shoulder had slipped out of joint
6613774 and i went to mike shanahan with gary and i said i dont think hes going to be able to play and zim says as long as no 7 is on the field ill be there he said dont you worry about me ill make it zim is probably one of the toughest guys to ever put on a uniform
6613775 during warm ups his shoulder had slipped out of joint
6613776 and i went to mike shanahan with gary and i said i dont think hes going to be able to play and zim says as long as no 7 is on the field ill be there he said dont you worry about me ill make it zim is probably one of the toughest guys to ever put on a uniform
6613777 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6613778 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample

6613782 people consistently tell us that our tanks tales and tastings sessions are the best brewery tour theyve ever done
6613783 im sure its because they get such an up close encounter with the brewing equipment and get to spend an hour with one of the people who actually makes the beer
6613784 to my knowledge they are not being widely discussed as training tools
6613785 they could be far more cost effective and can demonstrate far more variations complications and recovery from errors in surgeries than traditional techniques
6613786 while simulators based on video game technology may help surgeons improve their skills i do not think it is an absolute necessity
6613787 i am yet to come across an indian medical college that uses simulators for training surgeons
6613788 i use the same hand eye coordination to play video games as i use for surgery
6613789 this means that games are not merely good or bad but powerful education tools and may have many unexpected effects
6613790 why cant i worship the lord in my own way by praying like hell on my deathbed
6613791 you know what they say a bat in the hand is worth two in the belfry
6613792 its back to school at a mart save 900 on all the hottest brands
6613793 the leukemia has taught me to think step by step
6613794 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6613795 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6613796 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6613797 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6613798 i was shattered at the finish i just wanted a lie down and have a sleep but before i knew it i was on a stretcher
6613799 loosen up america please you cant even take a damn picture of your own children anymore without being accused of child abuse and paedophilia
6613800 opposes all attempts to restrict access to library services materials and facilities based on the age of library users
6613801 sorry buddy but we lets whoever wants to check out whatever they wants check out whatever they wants
6613802 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
6613803 he was an emotional winner on monday because of all the connections i have with him it was a little more personal than some of the winners weve had
6613804 we raised him we didnt breed him although my father does own the mare now and its that much more fun when you do well with one youve raised
6613805 jason said if hed been a three year old he would have pulled him in the backstretch last week he felt that good
6613806 it takes him a couple of steps to get into gear but as long as you dont rush him he tries pretty good
6613807 i probably rushed him away from the gate a little bit in the elimination
6613808 thats probably why he made a mistake the gate was going slowly and i tried to compensate for that
6613809 in the consolation he had a lot of road trouble and never really had a shot i skipped grand river because its a half mile track and he won the first leg of the bridger series he hasnt really done anything wrong
6613810 his father didnt really get going until lexington at two and his father was precocious enough i had to be patient with him
6613811 this guy seems to be a little more mature earlier he just seems to be more mature mentally and more mature physically
6613812 jason will have to use him more early than i would have liked hell have to make his own way and that might cost us later
6613813 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or driving them out of it
6613814 bryans degree of difficulty isnt high enough for him to make the final but i believe he can barring major mistakes qualify for the semi finals
6613815 he wont be affected by nerves as he is making his second olympics appearance and he also has the experience of having competed in several major events
6613816 inexperience was pandelela and elizabeths biggest problem they are both very young and it is understandable that they couldnt maintain their consistency
6613817 both are being groomed for the future and we expected they would find it difficult to be consistent we also expected them to be nervous and the only way we can improve them in both aspects is by exposing them to more top quality events
6613818 we will not ask her to retire but we will definitely have a talk with her about her future plans her weakness has always been the reverse dives and she has no choice but to improve them
6613819 quick lets get the republicans out of power before there is nothing left in the country for the democrats to ruin
6613820 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
6613821 why would i want to see your room its identical to mine
6613822 ohhhh lmfao youre a nimrod you didnt outkick your coverage you were bamboozled

6613827 while were pointing out the obvious how about an obvious yet unasked question why werent explosives the first thing considered as the cause for the wtc buildings collapse
6613828 yeah i believe what theyre telling me that can happen naturally

6613832 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6613833 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6613834 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6613835 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6613836 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6613837 i watched bulger crawl along the edge of a straight razor thats my dream thats my nightmare crawling slithering along the edge of a straight razor and surviving
6613838 theres always been someone who seems to come from the bottom to the top
6613839 theres not going to be emphasis on that guy at the bottom if youre one of those bottom guys you need to understand the history and understand what it takes to reach your goals i was one of those guys who set my goals and went after them and i was able to accomplish them
6613840 the one thing that set me apart was that i didnt make the same mistake twice
6613841 whatever coaching pointer or critique i would get i learned from it and never made that mistake again
6613842 a lot of guys can get over 1 000 yards if they carry the ball enough
6613843 if you can average in that 5 yards a carry range youre doing something special
6613844 some guys are able to withstand that punishment week in and week out
6613845 other guys cant take the punishment and cant take the number of carries the key is if you do carry the ball 25 times a game can you keep that quickness and speed and that endurance throughout the game all those questions will be answered as time goes on
6613846 i feel i have the ability to set myself apart from other guys in the league
6613847 now its just about execution ive seen too many guys with so much
6613848 you need to have tight control so babies children do not manipulation you with their demands even crying out

6613850 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded

6613852 mrs gotbaums death while tragic does not warrant criminal charges against police officers who were simply trying to carry out their duties they committed no crime
6613853 from what we know at this stage they may have been grossly negligent in how they treated her but they certainly were not acting criminally
6613854 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings

6613858 this is not yet a known story to the world
6613859 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6613860 to you the living and the dead to you south ossetia
6613861 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6613862 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6613863 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6613864 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6613865 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through
6613866 music has reminded me that life is not only war
6613867 here i remembered that i am a construction worker and that means a creator
6613868 and so tomorrow hes going to go in and get a little cleanup hopefully nothing too serious and relieve some of the swelling and the pain
6613869 toms a guy whos going to play when hes hurt so for him not to be out there theres something wrong
6613870 a lot of times you go in there and do just a little cleanup and its nothing too serious if it is serious at least weve got it done and we havent been able to get him back as quickly as wed like so theres something in there we dont know what it is
6613871 i mean its very tough because i know tommys a competitor he wanted to come in and finish off his last year on a good note and this wasnt the way he wanted to do it
6613872 but its good for me because i get a chance to play and thats what a football player should want to do
6613873 youve seen guys come back from a scope injury in a week so its hard to tell
6613874 tommys a tough guy he played a game last year on a torn biceps most guys cant do that so hes a football player and he wants to play and hell be there if he can
6613875 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6613876 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6613877 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6613878 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
6613879 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
6613880 of course this is by no means an election endorsement who they choose as their president is the americans business
6613881 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
6613882 would like to see the establishment of a long term strategic treaty with the united states which would govern the basic aspects of our economic and cultural relations
6613883 see what the situation on the ground is and thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
6613884 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat
6613885 but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
6613886 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
6613887 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
6613888 of course this is by no means an election endorsement who they choose as their president is the americans business
6613889 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
6613890 would like to see the establishment of a long term strategic treaty with the united states which would govern the basic aspects of our economic and cultural relations
6613891 see what the situation on the ground is and thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
6613892 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat
6613893 but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
6613894 it is a fundamental problem for us that it should not be possible in my country to prosecute offences or crimes committed by us soldiers against our population
6613895 ley org nica de telecomunicaciones la inform tica y los servicios postales
6613896 esto es una oportunidad que me est dando dios he vuelto a nacer y tengo que hacer muchas cosas grandes todav a en mi vida
6613897 i wish i could see you do that little cheerleader move could be kissing that perfect stomach of yours
6613898 while my past actions were unfortunate and for which i have expressed to my family my sincere apology one blogger has alleged that official rules or laws were broken that simply is not true
6613899 its sad that my political opponents have chosen to resort to the lowest tactics by dredging up a private matter from years ago just 21 days before an election
6613900 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6613901 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6613902 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6613903 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6613904 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6613905 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them
6613906 yes he did break the law he committed a wrong but he shouldnt be punished harshly because he had a lot of good reasons to do what he did
6613907 he believes very sincerely he couldnt participate in this war in good conscience
6613908 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6613909 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6613910 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6613911 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6613912 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6613913 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6613914 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6613915 im agnostic to the science and the debate about what the cause is
6613916 all i know is theres water where there didnt used to be
6613917 that is a brilliant idea what do you need from me
6613918 anyone know if mr mortimore plans can be persuaded to release an ebook who killed kennedy is available in this format
6613919 the fact is im sick of being kicked in the arse for doing what people ask and having no recourse but to allow them to make it out to be my fault when their lack of professionalism sends the whole sorry mess spiralling down the pan
6613920 why i hear you mumbling in weary abandonment you were right you guys put a f kload of work into this and this book would not now exist without you that means a lot to me far more than any stupid gripe with a f kwitted editor
6613921 we fully appreciate and share your concern about the potential civil liberties implications of the consolidated guidelines
6613922 afford appropriate protections for our civil rights and civil liberties
6613923 honestly when i wrote that book counterfeit revival i never envisioned what would happen in the year 2008 with todd bentley who harks back to all those revival years as a basis for whats happening today
6613924 the trading environment is worse than yesterday as the yen became stronger after yesterdays close and oil prices rose sharply
6613925 lingering worries about the global economy including japan are also weighing on the market
6613926 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins

6613928 what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
6613929 this is our most exciting new partnership and has validated our brand worthy reputation with such an esteemed and cutting edge circuit
6613930 its an extreme honor to be working with afm eurasia and kronverk cinemas and we look forward to our long term relationship in the 3d global movement our respective companies share the same philosophy as visionaries and accurately depicts our common goals
6613931 eurasia cinemas will continue its cutting edge presence with exclusive partners like imax and thx to deliver only the best to our audiences so were honored to be associated with xpand to develop our screens in digital 3d which weve determined is the correct approach in providing high quality solutions

6613933 ive gotta try both to write a good review so i wanna start on top
6613934 before i used to scrape up money for gas because i have to get to school as early as possible thats why i sacrificed a lot just for my car but now i dont have to do that anymore all thanks to my friends who helped me in getting discount gas cards

6613936 before i used to scrape up money for gas because i have to get to school as early as possible thats why i sacrificed a lot just for my car but now i dont have to do that anymore all thanks to my friends who helped me in getting discount gas cards
6613937 i have a car and i usually fill my tank in half because of money but after a relative of mine introduced me to on discount gas cards i felt like a weight has been taken off from my shoulders now i can purchase gas with a full tank
6613938 while we have been affected by the increased frequency of natural perils widening credit spreads and soft cycles in key markets we have acknowledged we need to do better
6613939 the groups fy09 insurance margin is expected to be above 10 per cent and now includes corporate expenses and the nsw insurance protection tax which were previously reported separately and are equal to about 1 per cent of the reported margin
6613940 iag is a unique asset with leading franchises and iconic brands
6613941 we are confident that our revised strategy and actions will improve shareholder value in fy09 and beyond
6613942 in both australia and new zealand rate increases are being implemented in line with rising claims costs and frequency while in commercial insurance we have ceded volume to maintain price discipline
6613943 the australian market for transport fuels and convenience retailing will continue to grow and caltex is well positioned to capture future market opportunities
6613944 refiner margins are expected to be volatile but remain robust overall
6613945 continued strength in diesel and jet fuel margins will likely compensate for the expected weakening in petrol demand
6613946 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6613947 i hear yet say not much yet hear the more
6613948 our goal is to make online backup available to anyone regardless of which operating system device or language they use we are thus not ruling out a future release of an open source solution or an api
6613949 we will shortly be able to produce a version for linux compatible with a wide array of distribution networks
6613950 its the first time i can remember where its been like that
6613951 we are in a transition right now and have to figure a way to get focused and not take the football aspect for granted
6613952 i have no idea where anything is we are learning
6613953 we pushed the envelope a little bit this week and added some things and looked at some things
6613954 because were not going to have that time next week
6613955 im kind of whipping them just to get through this and then now well start freshening up starting today
6613956 of advertising in the newspaper many people find it a viable method of advertising the products they no longer need
6613957 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6613958 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6613959 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there and that about sums it up
6613960 because he was deemed not to be a security threat
6613961 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6613962 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6613963 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6613964 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6613965 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6613966 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6613967 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6613968 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6613969 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6613970 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia
6613971 i can confirm that he has now left on the flight to london
6613972 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
6613973 one of the characteristics of counter insurgency unlike conventional war is the more successful you are in the short term the more troops you require
6613974 the more ground and the more people you become responsible for the more troops you need
6613975 i cant change this here let me drive it up the street
6613976 im not a tire mechanic but i play one on tv
6613977 insert into accounts username password email first name website name website url language ip created

6613979 225 000 ethnic albanian men aged between 14 and 59
6613980 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6613981 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6613982 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6613983 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6613984 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6613985 in the trials statins reduced the risk of a first myocardial infarction heart attack and overall mortality with long term follow up and collection of cancer data in a majority of studies insight into the risk of cancer among statin naive persons and statin users can be derived
6613986 in our current meta analysis statins did not reduce the incidence of cancer or cancer death
6613987 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6613988 we are hoping to reopen all wards today once they are cleaned
6613989 we are going to resume elective services on monday assuming the decline in presentations continues
6613990 gentlemen we just seized an airfield that was pretty ninja
6613991 what is significant is that no other red alarm will be displayed until the original alarm is silenced
6613992 there were so many false alarms that they just treated it like every alarm was a false alarm and you didnt have to pay attention
6613993 i think this is an issue that has gotten blown out of proportion due to misinterpretation and misunderstanding
6613994 its difficult to understand the issues that are going on in a clinical setting if you dont have that clinical background
6613995 we never had a bad system or a faulty system but we are continually improving it to make it better and better
6613996 i hope things change out there so the veteran is number one
6613997 where people had chosen to go back to work the primary feedback ive had is that what people feel it will take to move the bank is beyond what they are prepared to do at this stage
6613998 those members who have decided to stay out feel the difference between a 4 percent offered by the bank and 5 percent rise is so minimal for a billion dollar bank to afford
6613999 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6614000 as the calf is still being breast fed we have no way of feeding or socializing it so taking this humpback into captivity is not an option
6614001 we have a whale whose condition has deteriorated rapidly over the last 24 hours and who now experts are telling us is suffering and weve had to make the hard decision to euthanize the whale

6614003 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6614004 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6614005 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6614006 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6614007 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6614008 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6614009 you just gotta listen to the words and get what you can get out of it

6614012 atacms is a combat proven lethal asset in the war on terror
6614013 its accuracy and lethality continues to be demonstrated in theater against high value targets
6614014 atacms accuracy and range enables our warfighters to engage targets over large distances
6614015 its clear that our customers depend on atacms to carry out their most challenging missions
6614016 the radars electronics originally were housed in four cabinets within two shelters
6614017 the upgraded systems include modernized electronics that fit in one cabinet and a single shelter making the systems easier to transport and maintain with these technology upgrades there also will be improved reliability as well as a real reduction in life cycle support costs
6614018 analyst consensus forecasts as at 21 august 2008 cover a wide range between 428 million and 1 019 million with an average of 751 million

6614020 the show was the largest i have ever done normally i have worked with about 6 8 media servers and this was just huge at 110 this was my first time to use axon and i found it very easy to use and very flexible for the scale of the show it was ideal
6614021 the globe was projected on from 8 projectors external to the globe set up in four groups approximately 90 degrees from one another
6614022 we had no orbital heads for this one as we needed a much bigger image and more brightness we used axons and their blending feature to help achieve this effect we had the globe recovered with white material to get the best from the projection the original was dark grey
6614023 we programmed the show on one wholehog 3 network running version 2 6 software we had the network set up as one server console that was never touched and just used as the server two client consoles at foh for myself and my programming assistant steve kellaway and one console as a roamer for programming around the stadium to get better viewpoints i have been using the wholehog 3 console since its birth and i feel its the best tool for the job the ease at programming lots of media servers and being able to link to timecode was a joy the show was run on ltc timecode which came from the music the whole system was rock solid
6614024 we love christie projectors for their superior image quality and brightness they allow us to achieve a stunning 120k lumen output that competes in brightness with led screens but with better resolution and quality the projectors deliver a super bright and extremely clear image with no rainbow effect which is crucial for live performances they really add another dimension to the show
6614025 because the show is moving very fast with a lot of back to back performances on the road quick set up alignment and blending of the projectors is essential christie projectors are easy to use and set up with our photon systems and software that automatically blends the triple stacked projectors and also manages all of the content for the show with christies latest remote control roadtools software we have even more flexibility to do things like shutter the lenses and even write our own applications to control the projectors using christienet protocol
6614026 it was really just a great display of golf today he played fabulous theres not much else to say
6614027 he drove the ball straight he really controlled his trajectory on his iron shots hit the ball into the right spot of the green and holed a bunch of putts
6614028 he was six under this morning through 14 holes which is just something else around here
6614029 i am really confident and played very aggressively today everything is working for me right now
6614030 for most voters there has been little to show for mr johnsons seismic victory
6614031 the tories will be represented in denver by francis maude the shadow cabinet office minister as well as simon burns an opposition whip who unusually for a tory has always identified with the democrats the party is also sending a strong team to the republican convention in st paul the next week this will be led by liam fox the shadow defence secretary who was able to retain good relations with the bush administration during a five year frost caused by tory criticism of the war in iraq
6614032 sir john major is in danger of becoming a national treasure
6614033 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6614034 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6614035 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6614036 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6614037 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz
6614038 we expect the total industry to soften for the second half of this year
6614039 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6614040 i support the northland unions stop the drop campaign to prevent the new zealand rugby union axing our team from top flight rugby
6614041 this contrivance driven from wellington nzru is an affront to the north northlanders should respond to this offensive recommendation
6614042 i think we have got to show people outside of northland what we desire
6614043 we need to have a solid show of commonality in the northland union that we want to be part of this competition we need a critical show of support and a sounder commercial base
6614044 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6614045 and i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
6614046 if you really think that were doing something wrong at least have the balls to stand up and go hi my name is so and so
6614047 leaving the person out of the credits could be a mistake
6614048 i feel when you talk about resident evil and silent hill youre talking essentially a metamorphosis of zombie movies they have limited appeal for me though i respect hugely the effort and the care and the beauty of games i want to be working with people who want to create the war amp peace of games the citizen kane of games and not just be warming up george romero
6614049 the world trade center attacks mark a deep cut in our recent history that is still being processed the french american artist douglas edric stanley has found an unusual though obvious metaphor with his work invaders which is based on the 1978 arcade original in his interactive large installation the players must prevent the catastrophe by controlling the well known cannon at the lower screen border with their bodies and firing it using arm movements like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
6614050 if xbox live were a state it would rank as the countrys seventh largest giving it approximately 20 electoral votes

6614056 mental illness is hard to recognise for those who come across it for the first time
6614057 i look back now and think how could i not have seen it

6614059 we are hoping to reopen all wards today once they are cleaned

6614061 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6614062 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6614063 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6614064 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6614065 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end
6614066 theres still a significant amount of cars that are being sold
6614067 theres definitely been a dramatic shift in the last six to 12 months and the car industry needs longer than that to plan for the future
6614068 we are making the right decisions and bringing the focus in 2011 is the right decision
6614069 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined
6614070 purchase price i paid for the product is what gamestop ebgames would be liable for
6614071 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6614072 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6614073 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6614074 love what youre doing and do a great job at it someday someone would be willing to pay you just for doing what you love to do and doing a great job at it
6614075 the man started throwing wild punches at the woman who did not give up but kept punching back
6614076 men who harass women in public places should be expecting that kind of beating from women
6614077 the man who was floored had a very bad habit of pinching womens buttocks in public
6614078 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6614079 the scene was set for bhp and rio yesterday afternoon and the market anticipated their stocks would benefit
6614080 i do not believe the 360 section is in need of this
6614081 content is king but what if it has no kingdom
6614082 it may be of royal birth but its not on the throne
6614083 if you have no people on your side your content isnt king its just a lonely loser with delusions of grandeur
6614084 if you have no people on your side your content isnt king its just a lonely loser with delusions of grandeur

6614135 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6614136 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6614137 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6614138 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6614139 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6614140 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6614141 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view
6614142 they struggle and try to fight back to the very end even after their skin has been stripped off breathing heart beat directional body and eyelid movements were evident for five to 10 minutes
6614143 our short to medium term focus will be honing our retail formula for future growth from this base

6614149 i have noticed weve been doing more passing using more three wides early on
6614150 we have the ability to give defenses tough matchups with our receivers in this league its all about making big plays its hard to go 80 yards in 12 plays teams that make the big plays win the game and we have difference makers on the outside
6614151 right now a strong part of our offense is the passing game
6614152 but were eventually going to have to get the running game going because when it gets colder out here youll have to run that ball
6614153 watching a lot of clips from three four five years ago they were in a lot of empty sets they were throwing all over the place especially with elway they threw their fair share of deep balls and empty sets
6614154 the history of the running game here has been a weapon
6614155 its feared by every defensive coordinator in the league that does open the passing game up a little bit teams are a little more hesitant to pressure us as much as other teams because we run the ball on third and 5 and get the first down some of the passing game is the result of our run game is so good
6614156 i think the broncos feel pretty confident that they know how to run the ball
6614157 i think youll still see the broncos run the ball 25 to 30 times a game it just might be three guys who get those carries
6614158 control what you can control let everything else take a flying at you and if you must go down go down with your guns blazing

6614168 fails to uphold the non proliferation requirements that congress approved in 2006
6614169 the george w bush administration has made concessions to india as part of the deal that will enable india to expand significantly its capability to both produce nuclear weapons and stockpile nuclear weapons usable material by extracting plutonium from u s origin nuclear fuel this is a whole new level of increased weapons and material production
6614170 as one of only three countries that has never signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and by continuing to refuse to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty or commit to stopping the production nuclear weapons usable material india has shunned meaningful nonproliferation commitments
6614171 the nuclear suppliers group should not cave in to pressure by india and the united states and hastily approve the nuclear deal because of the dangerous implications for nuclear nonproliferation efforts
6614172 granting an exception for india without conditions would undermine u s and international security by significantly weakening nuclear nonproliferation efforts at a time when nuclear weapons pose the gravest threat to the world
6614173 the u s india nuclear deal risks fueling a regional arms race with pakistan complicating negotiations over iran and unraveling the npt which has been the best defense against the spread of nuclear weapons for 40 years
6614174 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6614175 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6614176 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6614177 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6614178 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events

6614213 we found our rhythm once we started to slow things down
6614214 i think everybody stepped up jenni screen had an amazing game and stepped right in and i think that our best is ahead of us
6614215 there is still a gap between our strength and that of the worlds best teams there are differences in personal abilities we didnt do well in rebounds and the physical side of the game was too much for us

6614220 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
6614221 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
6614222 joe wont be afraid to get in mccains face which is what obama needs
6614223 he will in fact be providing very significant exculpatory evidence
6614224 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
6614225 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
6614226 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6614227 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6614228 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6614229 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6614230 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6614231 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6614232 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6614233 yesterday i spent a lot of time analyzing who obama is
6614234 the democrat party has actually nominated a neighborhood activist a street activist as its presidential candidate who is clueless
6614235 this obama disinformation about mccain hearing the obama interview and obamas answers on saturday night is priceless
6614236 he wasnt qualified at the time he was elevated to that position
6614237 i mean why didnt these morons leave new orleans before the hurricane ill tell you why because they wanted to rape and loot thats just the way some people are and if theyre black if the rapists and looters are black its not george bushs fault weve had these problems ever since the emancipation proclamation once the whites leave town all youve got is overwhelming lawlessness thats not racism mr snerdley its a proven demonstrable fact have you even seen a ghetto in greenwich connecticut i rest my case
6614238 im not interested in partisanship that serves no other purpose than to gain a temporary advantage over our opponents this mindless paralyzing rancor must come to an end we belong to different parties not different countries
6614239 obama is getting desperate ladies and gentlemen as are his supporters
6614240 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
6614241 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6614242 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6614243 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6614244 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6614245 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6614246 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6614247 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6614248 motion presents non frivolous arguments suggesting he currently lacks a rational understanding of the connection between his role in his offense and the punishment imposed upon him
6614249 we applaud the court for upholding jeff woods rudimentary due process right to have his competency evaluated
6614250 a number of friends of mine have commented on an odd phenomenon that they have observed conservative republicans they know who are saying that they are going to vote for barack obama it seemed at first to be an isolated fluke perhaps signifying only that my friends know some strange conservatives but apparently columnist robert novak has encountered the same phenomenon and has coined the term obamacons to describe the conservatives for senator obama
6614251 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
6614252 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
6614253 the only thing i could says is im sorry even though they shouldnt accept it my heartfelt apologies for their loss and what ive done

6614255 the end of a long and painful time for them
6614256 the video is clearly not an episode and can be defined as threatening in nature and defamatory more specifically libelous and slanderous the video is in print and spoken
6614257 however it should be noted that there are facts in this case that are disputed including the findings of the medical examiner and urge that judgment be withheld until the legal proceedings are complete
6614258 the second time in less than two weeks that rodriguez was cut down while representing the tying or go ahead run
6614259 one thing i learned from joe torre and lou piniella was that a manager will never get mad at you for playing the game right hustling and making an aggressive mistake
6614260 theyll get mad at you if you dont push the envelope
6614261 there was a delay because i didnt know where the ball was
6614262 usually when theres a lack of hustle its not in the ninth inning down by one whoever is saying that doesnt know about baseball that doesnt bother me one bit
6614263 it looked like he was out of whack from the beginning a lot of times when you get jammed youre not sure where you hit it i remember paul oneill used to hit balls and hed have no idea where he hit them wed be screaming for him to run
6614264 i made a really wide turn around first thats what im guilty of
6614265 my only regret is that i wish i would have picked up the ball right away and had a better turn that guy just made an unbelievable play
6614266 unless a walrus sneaks in from the tundra and attacks roy halladay in the dugout sometime in the next few innings there is no chance the yankees win this game
6614267 aggressiveness mistaken for running the yanks out of an inning
6614268 wenn mir jemand gesagt h tte dass eine deutsche country music arrangieren produzieren und singen k nnte als ob sie eine amerikanerin w re und einer von nashvilles top produzenten dies produziert h tte ich h tte tr nen gelacht nun jetzt weine ich weil dies ein wundersch nes album der sehr talentierten s ngerin katja kaye ist warm lebendig gef hlvoll und wahrhaft echter country vielleicht sollte sich nashville dieses album anh ren um herauszufinden wo sie vom weg abgekommen sind

6614275 you cant expect food nutrition directors to be filling up their trunk with produce
6614276 there really could be a positive connection between farms and schools if we can have someone to fill the gaps
6614277 they will make a meaningful contribution to a more nutritious diet for washington school kids and economic opportunity for the states fruit and vegetable growers
6614278 theyre going to see a difference right away in what they can do and provide for their kids
6614279 oddly enough to those of us that are pretty used to buying fruits and vegetables things like snap peas or jicama dont sound so unusual but for many kids its the first time theyve tasted a mango or even a radish
6614280 just like parents struggling at home were having to evaluate all of our purchases
6614281 this wont cover the increases entirely but it will help
6614282 i assumed that once this bill passed wed have some folks calling us but no one has
6614283 so were back to where we were before trying to broker our own relationships
6614284 this will allow kids to have those fresh fruits and vegetables at different times throughout the day
6614285 that way the kids who are high poverty wont go home hungry
6614286 the grant program lets us do some wonderful things at one school
6614287 but were trying to find things that are sustainable for all schools not just some

6614289 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6614290 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6614291 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6614292 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6614293 i think anyone would like to go on a date with her
6614294 cest ce quon a dit ya m me pas dix minutes sur france 3 et yaura aucun smiley aujourdhui
6614295 i dont know it seemed almost fake until i grasped the situation
6614296 i just saw a shotgun through the window and soon as i came out there the shotgun just turned on me
6614297 i thought that was it as soon as it turned on me
6614298 i couldnt really fit through it and fell to the downstairs and cut my face open pretty good i went face down
6614299 he was telling me to come in here and get valuables and i was just trying to stall i guess
6614300 it didnt know i was bleeding i sprinted through some of these back yards and through the city parking lot and ran up to top stop
6614301 its probably a lot better that there was no one else over here couldve been a lot worse

6614371 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6614372 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6614373 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6614374 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6614375 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6614420 you should spend some time in the real world rather than reading the chicken little ny times fantasies
6614421 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
6614422 mccain pledges to balance the budget by 2012 not by increasing taxes but by vetoing all pork barrel spending and curbing outlays for social security and medicare
6614423 mccains overall goal is to balance the budget by the end of his second term says economic adviser douglas holtz eakin that would be 2017
6614424 said that if the war and the personal and corporate tax cuts that mr mccain advocated added to the federal deficit and debt so be it i would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction he said
6614425 that plan when appropriately phased in as it has always been intended to be will bring the budget to balance by the end of his first term
6614426 but were not going to have a balanced budget before you leave office in your first term
6614427 well that still should be a goal but the goal the goal right now is to get the economy going again
6614428 you have to pay for that somehow or you are george bush iii
6614429 the fact i made was that in this time of economic strain obama is openly trying to increase the governments reach

6614438 and yes i support his work and particularly his condemnation of obamas tax plan
6614439 government shouldnt be run like a business it should be run like a dangerous threat
6614440 the american economy has been getting pummeled by the one two punch of soaring oil prices and the collapse of the housing bubble but a stubbornly resilient economy has failed to produce the two quarters of declining output that have become the focus of the medias recession watch
6614441 people who are currently in their prime earning years are not getting married buying homes or starting families for one simple reason they cant afford it
6614442 raising a family and getting married have nothing to do with how much money you have

6614542 lungi dallessere arrendevole come descritto da churchill era un realista di ferro disposto a sacrificare piccoli paesi come labissinia e la cecoslovacchia per poter cos raggiungere i pi estesi obiettivi strategici
6614543 non dimostra affatto che questo approccio fosse sbagliato dimostra come hitler sia stato un fenomeno unico in politica internazioale un leader che non poteva essere n dissuaso n accontentato una delle grandi ironie delleredit di churchill conclude layne che da un evento del tutto unico sia stato tratto un insieme di regole universali per la conduzione della politica estera

6614549 i think they have something like 60 residences in the entire city
6614550 so i think theyre kind of gearing themselves toward industry
6614551 so they have a zoning system that has commercial zones and it has commercial uses permitted in those zones
6614552 but usually a city has it set up so that they have permitted uses conditionally permitted uses and prohibited uses the city of industry has permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses and they specifically list under those two categories the uses that are permissible in the city one just over the counter and the other going through a conditional use permit process and if you look down their list it doesnt say that internet caf is a permitted use it doesnt say internet access service which is what im calling it is permitted either
6614553 ordinarily other cities have a or similar type use clause in their code
6614554 and they have someone appointed whos the development manager or city manager or some person who makes a decision that well yeah we can shoehorn it into this category because its similar in this regard or that regard they city of industry dont have that relief valve available in their ordinance its either in there or its not there if its not there then you can make a proposal that the city amend their ordinance to include that use that you want to do but its strictly discretionary
6614555 if they choose to give it to you after staff reviews it if they think its worthy they staff will make a recommendation to the city council but of course youve got to get through that first hurdle of that staff review
6614556 then youve got a second review by the people that sit on the city council and they can say yea or nay that seems a little iffy to me for a first amendment conditional use
6614557 i tried to talk to them before suggesting that they look at schad v borough of mt ephraim then maybe that would give them a clue that you cant totally ban protected expression
6614558 that was entertainment which is expressive conduct sometimes and this is just pure access to the internet i made the point that i dont see the difference between our situation and their saying we dont have any newspapers in our city you cant sell any newspapers here im thinking that probably wouldnt fly even with our current supreme court

6614579 it gives us a good methodology to approach other organisations in other states
6614580 individual schools will have the ability to set security policies that dictate which websites are allowed to be accessed
6614581 aisv is not expecting every school to take this up but theyre making it available to everyone depending on the number of schools deployment could take about six months

6614583 id always said id never write a book like this
6614584 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6614585 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6614586 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6614587 and he and about four other people would read that

6614604 well then we watched while the mother pecked it to death and drowned it because we had touched it
6614605 my mother felt so bad about it that soon after she got us each a baby duckling but my sister was only two and a half and it didnt end well
6614606 well the duckling pecked her on the chin and she well she just reacted she

6614615 saw no harm in rejecting some of their churchs doctrines
6614616 i feel that in religious training as in any other thing you are taught the basics from those basics you sort out what you want or pick it apart as you see fit

6614656 investigators determined that debris from the falling twin towers ignited fires on at least 10 floors at 7 world trade center which was about 400 feet north of where the citys two tallest buildings once stood the blazes burned out of control for six hours as the city fire department devastated by the collapse of the twin towers abandoned its efforts to extinguish the fire and the sprinkler system was incapacitated
6614657 the heat from these fires the investigators said caused the beams on the lower floors of the east side of the tower to expand ultimately causing a girder on the 13th floor to disconnect from a critical interior column that supported the buildings long floor spans once the 13th floor gave way a cascade of floor failures started down to the fifth floor leading to the overall collapse of the tower

6614955 the cheyennes will have to be roundly whipped or completely wiped out before they will be quiet i say that if any of them are caught in your vicinity the only thing to do is kill them
6614956 it simply is not possible for indians to obey or even understand any treaty i am fully satisfied gentlemen that to kill them is the only way we will ever have peace and quiet in colorado
6614957 it simply is not possible for indians to obey or even understand any treaty
6614958 reveal the depth and pervasiveness of the racism against indigenous peoples so deeply engrained in the history and psyche of the united states and the dominant culture

6614971 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6614972 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6614973 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6614974 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6615017 people think oh this is sugar free or fat free so i can eat as much as i want
6615018 once your body realizes its not getting as much food it starts to conserve energy
6615019 when leptin levels are low the body reacts by conserving energy expenditure so much that you stop burning calories at a normal rate
6615020 if you cant see yourself eating or exercising a certain way for the rest of your life say consuming raw food and running five miles every day you shouldnt be doing it to lose weight in the first place
6615021 weight management has to be an uncompromising non negotiable everyday thing like brushing your teeth
6615022 dont count fat protein calories portions just keep track of what youve already consumed before you put the next thing in your mouth it gives your brain a chance to say no
6615023 these small scale techniques sound insignificant but they are the answers were all looking for
6615024 were not paying attention to what we eat or how much
6615025 and often not even to whether were really physically hungry people eat for social reasons or because theyve had a bad day or for comfort
6615026 eat here or well slash the tires on your home

6615038 we believe that while the internets use in grassroots messaging and organization has been a growing story the next step in this evolution was to show how it can be used as a primary launching pad for a more formalized campaign we see the campaigns jump from online to cable television as a validation of that vision and we are thrilled that time warner cable has agreed to be a partner in this process ultimately of course their involvement means an even larger audience for the message the importance of young people getting involved in the political process which remains at the core of this campaign
6615039 we recognize the importance of making people aware of their right to vote
6615040 this is a great opportunity to be involved with this important campaign and we are pleased to be one of the sponsors

6615042 yesterday john mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he said i think the economy is fundamentally strong
6615043 now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6615044 my advice to rookie defensive backs is to take the shortest route to the ball and arrive in a bad mood
6615045 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6615046 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6615047 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6615048 of course at the begining of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6615049 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state

6615068 the story about alexander solzhenitsen and the old man who made the sign of the cross was first told by solzhenitsyn to a group of christian leaders and later recounted by billy graham in his new years telecast 1977
6615069 drew a stick through the ground at solzhenitsyns feet tracing the sign of the cross
6615070 he either made it up or heard it from someone else its one of those legends
6615071 while working at mother teresas orphanage in the early 1990s i stumbled upon the most beautiful little girl id ever seen
6615072 she had a terrible cleft palate she had problems with her feet she had problems with her hands she had all kinds of problems
6615073 as only mother teresa can she prevailed upon me to take this baby and another baby to the united states for medical care
6615074 i just could not let her go the only thing was i had not told my husband when i got back he asked me where will she go and i said i thought she could come to our house digital journal jun 15 2008
6615075 he says my god neil i just got elected to the senate
6615076 there is going to be a great wave coming you either ride the wave or itll roll over you
6615077 its not a matter of whether you want to wait for four years or eight years
6615078 leadership is not defined by the amount of time you spend in washington
6615079 just like me he came directly to the united states senate from the state senate he already knew the legislative process he knew when to hold em and when to fold em
6615080 barack especially in his first few years tried to work on selective issues and i emphasize selective issues with the republicans
6615081 to do anything he had to work with the republicans
6615082 he does think things through and he thinks about success what can we do to build a coalition while keeping the principles
6615083 thats a direct result of his experience in chicago where everything wasnt quite what it seemed
6615084 the stated reason for voting for things was never the real reason youd have to find out what their second job was or who their sister was
6615085 barack has said and i share the view that experience is oftentimes viewed as a substitute for judgment
6615086 i could easily call him the smartest person ive ever met
6615087 has the quality of being able to calm people down dont worry ill cogitate on this ill come up with a solution dont get rattled thats a very presidential quality
6615088 i remember he listened to the complaint and he said ive worked at a lot of organizations and sometimes thats just how it is
6615089 said cohen now a lawyer who handles insurance and class action lawsuits in los angeles
6615090 he was only maybe five years older than me but i felt like he was 50 years older than me in terms of the maturity with which he handled it
6615091 what he really wanted to be was a civil rights organizer but he was 10 to 11 years too young
6615092 barack is incredibly nuanced he can see gray as well as black and white
6615093 sounds great right but at times thats proven a nuisance for him he can sound almost wonky when hes forced in politics to take a black and white position he sees the rest
6615094 i think he likes to hear different points of view and he is a critical thinker
6615095 i remember less about his own opinions than the fact that he was masterfully able to make sure everyone else spoke their piece
6615096 he was very pragmatic and practical and he knew when to quit to get something passed
6615097 barack probably wanted to put in some kind of limits on campaign giving but he knew he couldnt get that through the rough and tumble illinois legislature
6615098 he was instrumental in writing the final draft of the legislation
6615099 i know barack was frustrated with the process being in the minority he had so many things he wanted to do
6615100 when you were in the minority you just did not get your name on legislation period if you sold maybe three bills of your own and picked up a number of house bills you were doing well
6615101 he used to joke that he couldnt vote for something that was probably unconstitutional or his students would laugh him out of the classroom
6615102 you saw a remarkable change in the due diligence that barack showed in pushing bills and language
6615103 he became the box guy he had so many bills he had to carry them in a box on the floor
6615104 barack sort of acted as a bridge between the intent and the logistics and he was able to accept and recognize some of the situations that occur in reality
6615105 in the worlds greatest deliberative body no one is listening
6615106 he and i did talk about how clearly we were going to have to do something about health care because clearly that was what everyone was talking about
6615107 and when we got here there was absolutely no interest in addressing health care
6615108 i really like the guy i dont want him to be my president and i think he could use some years on him but i like him just fine
6615109 thats the way people always think of things in washington where they think its all about the political rather than the personal
6615110 once said that it might be appropriate to apply the death penalty to those who carried out abortions
6615111 why answer a question by throwing a friend under a bus
6615112 he asked me if he could go with me to russia because he knew that i go every year
6615113 ive always found him to be conscientious and well prepared
6615114 he was always at the end of the line at that time but he was always there and his questions were always very thoughtful
6615115 he was one of the only senators who was constantly being trailed by his own press corps in the clubby atmosphere of the senate that can become a problem but it wasnt in this case
6615116 he had the trust and confidence of both sides he knew all the players
6615117 i think both sides trusted him enough that they felt they could get a fair hearing
6615118 it was an issue where both sides were just so dug in with their positions that he tried but he was not successful
6615119 i think he felt a particular pull that no one else would feel as the only african american member of the senate but when he visited he didnt only talk about that aspect of it
6615120 seemed to assume that every american has the capacity to load up the family in a suv fill it up with 100 worth of gasoline stick some bottled water in the trunk and use a credit card to check into a hotel on safe ground
6615121 but i see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government toward the least of us
6615122 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
6615123 please be assured i wont make the same mistake again
6615124 we have generally across the board said that a nuclear iran is unacceptable i happen to share that view
6615125 but i think it is worth at least exploring the other side or examining why it is not acceptable
6615126 he didnt seem to understand why people would be mad about that and they were mad
6615127 the problem with this bill is not that it is too tough on terrorists the problem with this bill is that it is sloppy
6615128 and the reason it is sloppy is that we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right
6615129 i think that sent a strong signal to the majority leader and others that this was the real standard for reform
6615130 he would explain to us how he was walking a fine line between the leadership and us
6615131 he was very straightforward with us on what he thought he could get and what he thought he couldnt get
6615132 really does not reveal the kind of guerrilla warfare that took place behind closed doors

6615147 its not about the pain pills its about the fact that i am in alot of pain and you arent doing anything about it i dont care what he does he can stand me on my head if it makes the pain go away
6615148 well if youre really in that much pain you should see your primary doctor

6615178 on my first sabbatical in 1966 laura mae my mother and i took laura my sister to europe we spent a good part of our time abroad living in a charming house on a hill on the south side of florence with great views of the city around the corner from us was a small local piazza with a little mom and pop grocery store where we bought daily necessaries and i practiced my italian on one side of this square was a high wall enclosing the grounds of a grand historic villa one day i saw something really bizarre in the square a couple of large vans were unloading movie equipment and even a real camel i learned from my grocer friend that a movie company had rented the grounds of the villa to film a movie set in renaissance florence and this villa with its view of the duomo etc was perfect moreover my grocer friend had managed to get the contract to set up a lunch counter inside the wall where the movie people could get sandwiches and drinks during their breaks and he said he could get us in of course we were excited to have all this fancy stuff going on right in our quiet little neighborhood a little later in the morning laura mae and i wheeled laura in her stroller over and my friend got us through the gate inside we saw actors crew setting lights cameras and cameramen etc all the actors were in fancy renaissance dress and looked pretty strange when they were on break smoking cigarettes and drinking cokes much to our amazement we saw an italian movie star of the period vittorio gassman he was married for a time to shelley winters and a well known french actress also all dressed up gassman was unbelievably handsome even more so in person than in the movies but the big special treat of the day was seeing of all people mickey rooney he was playing a little devil literally in this movie we watched them filming a scene for a while and when they broke for lunch mickey came over to the lunch counter to get something to eat i spoke to him and he was so happy to hear english with an american accent that he almost hugged me we chatted a while and a small crowd of locals who had also managed to get through the gate gathered around us they were much more impressed by mickey rooney than by their own movie star with me acting as interpreter since i could speak a little italian they asked questions about various entertainers and mickey was in his element not only talking about his hollywood friends but doing brilliant imitations of them i remember that he did jonathan winters so perfectly you had to blink to see that it was mickey and not jonathan there and mickey was warm friendly and very very funny the locals were enthralled even though they could not understand english but like the skilled entertainer he is mickey managed to communicate very well with his impromptu audience he was delighted with our little blond angel and picked her up and played with her when he had to go back to work i asked if hed pose with laura for a picture and we got my grocer friend into the picture too

6615276 the wind fire and the brooding bird are given to enable the church to be the church in other words to enable gods people to be gods people this has a surprising and dramatic effect the spirit is given so that we ordinary mortals can become in a measure what jesus himself was part of gods future arriving in the present a place where heaven and earth meet the means of gods kingdom going ahead the spirit is given in fact so that the church can share in the life and continuing work of jesus himself now that he had gone into gods dimension that is heaven

6615407 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6615408 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6615409 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6615410 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6615411 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6615421 it was an absolutely tragic end to a thing where we were hoping against hope that we could possibly have a better outcome

6615429 obama is the only elected official on record to ever vote in favor of denying life saving medical care to children who had been born but that were struggling for life is that a decision too confusing so as to be above the pay grade as well

6615431 we dont know why the chinese government has blocked itunes but it seems the most logical explanation is that it is because of us
6615432 one side of my brain says it must be the other side is just incredulous that our simple non violent action could have caused this
6615433 we spread the word around the athletes before the games that we were offering it to them for free
6615434 certainly we did intend the downloads to be a subtle form of protest for the athletes as well as an act of solidarity for the tibetan people
6615435 itunes is just an innocent bystander the album is being sold in hundreds of other stores it would have been stranger if itunes had not taken our album then that would have been a major political issue

6615445 so what do you say we get out of here kid
6615446 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6615447 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6615448 need to create a unique physical bond between the person carrying an id and the data which appears on it is essential in order to fight the worldwide forgeries should we succeed we would be able to create a nationwide database controlled as it should be by the state
6615449 forming such a database would harm the citizens basic right to privacy
6615450 the war set the stage for a more comprehensive middle east conflict
6615451 it set into motion a dynamic in the arab world where much of the arab street believes that hezbollah won that war and there is tremendous expectation on hezbollah to continue the struggle
6615452 we destroyed all of hezbollahs infrastructure much of its civilian headquarters we killed about a quarter of their fighters that is a prohibitive number of casualties for any modern fighting force and yet perception is everything in the middle east and the perception was in the arab world at least that israel was bested in that conflict
6615453 israel would then have to reply into lebanon possibly drawing in the syrians and ultimately the iranians
6615454 without question the situation was not handled very well by officer stephens but the characterization of the story has led to death threats against the officer and his family
6615455 its just a dog you can buy another one relax
6615456 i dont feel a person like that should be working in law enforcement
6615457 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6615458 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6615459 their friends are quite pleased that theyre gettign back together and are trying to give them space
6615460 shes the most discerning person ive ever met shell read a script 100 times shes relentless
6615461 the more you put into something the more you get out of it
6615462 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6615463 i dont have a full picture of the the protest attempt so i cant really comment
6615464 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6615465 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6615466 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6615467 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6615468 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6615469 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6615470 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6615471 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6615472 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6615473 a person opts to go over the border their information is going to be collected and held anyway
6615474 if you dont want to go over the border you dont have to
6615475 to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records
6615476 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
6615477 the chief rabbinate is willing to convert them but the government is saying it does not wish to allow these people to be candidates for conversion this is an unconscionable act requiring full cabinet approval every time a group of people wishes to move here and undergo conversion is a recipe for bureaucratic inertia as there is little chance of getting such an item onto the busy agenda of the entire government hence by creating a virtually insurmountable obstacle to approval sheetrit hopes to bury the issue once and for all
6615478 why you might be wondering would sheetrit and his cabinet colleagues do such a thing
6615479 the answer is really quite simple it is post zionism of the ugliest sort tinged by prejudice and sheer ignorance
6615480 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6615481 the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6615482 going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years
6615483 we asked israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state but they said theyre a sovereign state
6615484 well israel shouldnt be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to israels neighbors
6615485 whether this will be a serious offer or something just to scare the israelis well know in another few months
6615486 we told the israelis that this was a very unwise move and that russians were being killed because of georgias policy
6615487 they didnt take us seriously probably because they were encouraged by the united states
6615488 in 2007 israeli experts trained georgian commandos in georgia and there were plans to supply heavy weaponry electronic weapons tanks and other arms at a later date
6615489 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6615490 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6615491 we felt his time would be better spent on the ground here in washington state
6615492 mccains not polling too bad here nobody thinks hes going to win it but hes not as polarizing as george bush
6615493 those republicans that can make a claim of crossing party lines have always done really well in washington
6615494 they all see the polls hes popular in washington its not going to hurt to have the connection there
6615495 hey summer good look on the carrieer eaven i think its good well actually the best and so are you
6615496 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
6615497 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
6615498 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
6615499 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
6615500 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
6615501 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
6615502 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
6615503 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
6615504 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
6615505 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
6615506 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
6615507 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
6615508 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
6615509 the number of missiles in the hands of hizbullah has doubled if not tripled and that the range of the missiles has been extended and this has been accomplished with the close assistance of the syrians
6615510 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6615511 clarks essentially a good person and deep down im not
6615512 can you believe that guy actually thinks he has a shot
6615513 i dont want to pull the plug i want to talk
6615514 does not sit well with some of the people involved in the process
6615515 you can set russias recent invasion of georgia and israels concern over irans nuclear aspirations on the back burner not that these topics lack importance
6615516 the stage is not adequately set for the highly publicized ezekiel 38 and 39 russian iranian nuclear equipped consortia of nations to invade israel psalm 83 comes first and then ezekiel 38 follows on its heels like a goliath shadow there are two distinct invasions of israel one building upon the other with both occurring sequentially in the middle east
6615517 indeed something is very near but it is not armageddon
6615518 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6615519 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6615520 in order to have a base you need a decent navy ours is weak
6615521 a base is expensive to keep is it just to have a flag there a show of strength to scare
6615522 georgia began the crisis and the west accuses russia syria suffered the same thing attempts to destabilise the country distortion of the facts and double standards
6615523 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6615524 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6615525 we are also going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
6615526 most urgently needed at a time when the u s and its allies are targeting two of the last few russian allies in the middle east iran and syria
6615527 america will remain the biggest economy and military yet its diplomatic authority will continually trim till it finally rests at a more acceptable level to the rest of the world
6615528 from its handling of iran to its desire to play a more effective role in the middle east and world affairs it is apparent that the new russia is not prepared to be thrown around like a lightweight any more as it was after the end of soviet union
6615529 the return of russia portends a shift in the balance of political forces in the middle east that for the moment at least appears to weaken the american and pro western side of the balance and to strengthen the iranian side
6615530 one would think in light of the iraq debacle and the continuing disgrace of detention without charge that these two world powers would have been among the last to plant their flags in the shifting soil of moral high ground
6615531 has shown that washington will not always come to the rescue of its allies in their time of need
6615532 closeness to the united states will allow them to do anything they want
6615533 how can you talk about occupation when you are occupiers yourself the georgians along with the americans occupy iraq and now they are trying to portray themselves as fighters for freedom and democracy
6615534 all arabs are mad at georgia because it sent its troops to iraq and took part in the occupation of that arab land
6615535 if it werent for russia georgian forces would still be in iraq
6615536 there is a potential danger of countries in the arab world to take russias re entry into the global political scene as a major power broker as a signal to openly side with moscow
6615537 back to the worst years of the cold war where the arab world stagnated economically forever indebted to the soviets for arms and munitions that were always a step or two behind those of the west
6615538 today and merely to spite the u s many muslims forget that russian prime minister and former president vladimir putin has repeatedly taken violent military stances against muslims in chechnya and elsewhere and celebrate his violence to compensate for their constant failure
6615539 what happened in georgia is a good sign which means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
6615540 now there is balance in the world russia is being reborn and we value that it is very good for us for all of the middle east
6615541 designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of developing a proper relationship with libya
6615542 of course russia is our strategic partner and we cannot compare it with any other country for closeness thats obvious
6615543 the whole world needs russian gas russian oil it is not expedient for europe to let relations with russia worsen and then we the libyans will do everything possible to work in russia and invest in its economy because russia is a great country
6615544 child birth is painful without pills but still i wish i done it naturally instead of getting an abortion

6615548 one of the freshest funniest and most entertaining voices to enter the food blogosphere
6615549 so good has the lowdown on anything thats happening in the world of food media hes the guy who broke the lebron james papa johns scandal and the hilarious kraft cheese myspace debacle
6615550 fortune 500 corporations spend millions on r amp d for food products and marketing strategy eick picks them apart in a dc minute
6615551 i really like so good because it generally focuses on the more humorous food related news
6615552 always enjoyable if you havent read it yet do so immediately
6615553 like a bus full of carnies it scares the crap out of me to look at it but i stare anyway
6615554 a sandwich is just a sandwich but eick talking about a sandwich is epic poetry
6615555 jon eick has the rare gift of being diabolically funny without putting others down

6615557 end gt the problem is that i want to make the text editable by the client
6615558 end gt this breaks the javascript im assuming because it has illegal characters in it
6615559 my other line is ringing i have to take this call ill get back to you later
6615560 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6615561 it just costs so much to raise a child nowadays
6615562 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region
6615563 the next crisis predicted to cover mainly the persian gulf is the crisis of legitimacy of the monarchies and traditional systems which considering current circumstances cannot survive
6615564 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region
6615565 they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
6615566 by far for most of us the most likely reason we own a smart card is for use within our cellular handsets in the form of a sim card not all handsets require them but an estimated 2 7 billion did at the end of last year
6615567 the other two sectors that are forecast to aid the cellular market in driving the card installed base past 7 billion are the banking sector and the government health sector the installed bases of which are both projected to pass the 1 billion level this year additionally both are forecast to continue growing significantly as banks look to improve security and reduce fraud and as governments roll out large national infrastructure projects that utilise smart cards typical examples of the latter are biometric passports drivers licenses national id card schemes and healthcare applications
6615568 im against the lottery but if one of my members won the lottery i wish and i hope he would give 10 to the church we could do a lot of things with that money
6615569 we are in the process now of building a youth center and you would be surprised at the people that can be helped with 600 000
6615570 anything extra is bonus so that would be an extra blessing of offering after that so if i did win lotto sweepstakes i would tithe to my church
6615571 of this group the vast majority constitute arab or muslim states
6615572 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
6615573 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
6615574 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
6615575 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
6615576 the long term outcomes of the current russian georgian war will be felt far and wide from afghanistan to iran and from the caspian to the mediterranean
6615577 the war is a mid sized earthquake which indicates that the geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting and nations in the middle east including israel need to take notice
6615578 u s expressions of support of the kind provided to georgia short of an explicit mutual defense pact may or may not result in military assistance if when israel is under attack especially when the attacker has an effective deterrent such as nuclear arms deliverable against u s targets
6615579 in the future such an attacker could be iran or an arab country armed with atomic weapons israel can and should rely on its own deterrent a massive survivable second strike capability
6615580 this is something to remember when looking at recent american intelligence assessments of the iranian nuclear threat or the unsuccessful training of palestinian authority security forces against hamas
6615581 stake in the smooth flow of oil from the caspian
6615582 this use of small ethnically based proxies is similar to irans use of hizbullah and hamas to continuously attack israel
6615583 tbilisi tried for years to deal with these militias by offering a negotiated solution including full autonomy within georgia
6615584 an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
6615585 to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
6615586 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study
6615587 yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
6615588 godly leaders are supposed to protect the sheep from heresy
6615589 not spoon feed deception to them only god knows how far this poison traveled from lakeland to take root elsewhere may god forgive us for allowing his word to be so flippantly contaminated
6615590 anyone who is in services 4 to 6 hours a day 7 days a week for weeks on end is bound to have some type of breakdown
6615591 anyone who covers himself with tattoos while in the ministry raises questions about his stability
6615592 anyone who talks about the angel of the healing revival that ministered to a a allen and william branham must have overlooked the fact that allen and branham both were discredited with moral shortcomings anyone who baptizes people in the name of the father the son and bam is playing lightly with the holy spirit and is bordering on blasphemy
6615593 perhaps some of the problems would have been prevented if men had spoken into bentleys life several months ago
6615594 as good as it is to have an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff to help the injured it is much better to have a fence at the top of the cliff to prevent someone from going over
6615595 there is a dynamic that makes charismatic leader situations sometimes treated differently and it is partly tied to the very term charismatic
6615596 because this person is perceived to have charismatic power or anointing his or her failure in marriage is often easily forgiven and overlooked
6615597 john hagee of cornerstone church in san antonio divorced his wife of 15 years in 1975 and the next year remarried but his ministry and influence only grew in the years after that richard roberts son of oral roberts also divorced his first wife after 11 years of marriage and 10 months later remarried paula white and her husband randy divorced last year it was paula whites second marriage while these divorces have had ramifications for their ministries in every case the ministry only flourished afterwards in most other evangelical traditions the impact of divorce has been more deeply felt by the ministers in question
6615598 we do not know all the details of bentleys marital situation and so we should withhold judgment on that matter
6615599 what is plain is that he is teaching false doctrine and that the claims to his ministrys successes seem pretty spurious
6615600 on aug 12 toronto based catholic insight and its editor father alphonse de valk received notification that wells had filed an appeal with the federal court of canada wells is requesting that the appeal be heard in edmonton
6615601 likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt based on sexual orientation
6615602 catholic insight and its editor will be required to defend themselves in yet another proceeding we will be obliged once again to engage more of our time and finances to defend against what can be seen as harassment by a person or persons unhappy with catholic insights editorial stance in opposition to same sex marriage and the resulting drive for equality of the homosexual lifestyle in schools and elsewhere it is frankly astonishing that more canadians do not recognize the negative impact such complainants have on what should be the expression of ideas in our current culture
6615603 we are forced once more to appeal to the generosity of our supporters for assistance
6615604 it is chilling to think that a publication can be hauled before a government tribunal simply for reporting to interested citizens developments in these homosexual rights areas of controversy
6615605 this is the shocking true story about the reality behind abortion and the heroic struggle of a mother willing to do anything to save her child
6615606 even though the movie doesnt take any side the way i show it i show both sides of the spectrum on the issue of abortion
6615607 i just let the spectator decide which side hes going to take from the story because its based on a true story
6615608 about a woman who decides to get an abortion and she gets an abortion but its also the story of a woman who after she gets the abortion realizes what she has done when she has that mother son connection
6615609 we want to do private screenings for our target audience then branch out from there so viewers can recommend the movie to more people
6615610 were doing it that way because we dont have the money to distribute it nationwide yet but we do have access to viral marketing so we can get our main niche to follow the movie and recommend it and create enough noise to get media attention eventually wed like it to go all over the country
6615611 i know a lot of people who support the pro life movement would like to see this film excel
6615612 the main ways to do that are to help us make connections with media help us find places to do screenings and help us financially make those screenings happen
6615613 if we found a spot do a private screening im more than willing to try to make it happen right now our connections are in those cities where we have screenings planned but for example i dont know people in say chicago
6615614 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
6615615 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
6615616 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
6615617 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
6615618 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused
6615619 if you still love me please fogive me the crown of love is falling from me
6615620 and ive a grenade with our names scratched in the side but thats just love and you know that loves not enough
6615621 i dont want to pull the plug i want to talk

6615623 50 50 secrets i learned running 50 marathons in 50 days and how you too can achieve super endurance
6615624 be careful about reading health books you may die of a misprint

6615629 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
6615630 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6615631 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6615632 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6615633 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6615634 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable

6615693 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6615694 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6615695 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood

6615761 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6615762 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6615765 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
6615766 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6615767 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
6615768 cameron urges nato to admit georgia nato is a mutual defence pact this position will have gone down very well in tbilisi but do we really mean to commit ourselves to an all out war against the russian federation if something like this happens again i dont favour that approach and i dont know anyone who does
6615769 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6615770 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
6615771 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
6615772 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident
6615773 my mother is still there she was too old to flee

6615776 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6615777 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6615778 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6615779 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further

6615788 regarding the timing why 12 there are a lot of reasons we spent some time playing with different numbers timing ten seconds is actually a little too short oftentimes we saw people needing a second or two to mentally prepare or not realizing that recording had started 15 seconds is a little too long lots of testers said they were getting bored and twelve is kind of like us a little different we march to our own crazy drummers and we liked twelve it felt distinctive and its fun
6615789 we have many partnership discussions ongoing with a wide variety of different companies and services our goal is to be the platform for video status and any service that might benefit from a short form video status update mechanism is a service were interested in working with and supporting

6615792 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6615793 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6615794 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6615795 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6615796 if you choose to become a law enforcement officer you swear to uphold the laws of the state and the nation
6615797 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6615798 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6615799 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate

6615804 friday night a group of village students came to maravu to perform traditional dances for us

6615806 together with the fiesta resort we wanted to do something here on the property knowing that this is where we hold a special place with him
6615807 many people dont realize the enormous pressure on banks to avoid foreclosures
6615808 foreclosures are quite costly market conditions as well as current and new legislation is making lenders pay big time so theyre beginning to show signs of willingness to work with their subprime homeowners
6615809 there are so many key factors driving lenders to consider options they would have never dreamed
6615810 but all of this is pushing back the tide of foreclosures and making loan modifications very attractive to lenders we read this as very encouraging to strapped homeowners
6615811 we often have access to people within lending institutions who are formally or informally willing to modify these loans
6615812 and with our lengthy experience we know just how far lenders are willing to go in loan modification
6615813 traditionally the first week is a madhouse its going to be horrendous

6615845 the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial ayers has long taught at uic where the chicago annenberg challenge offices were housed rent free ayers likely arranged for the files of the chicago annenberg challenge to be housed in the uic library and may well have been consulted during my unsuccessful struggle to gain access to the documents

6615856 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class

6615870 all they can do on any given day is do their best and be responsible for themselves
6615871 based on what she did in track last spring and what weve seen from her in the summer we think she can run at 19 minutes or quicker in the 3 mile this year
6615872 theres no way were going to walk over people in this league but we do set our expectations high
6615873 this team has now tasted what it feels like to come real close but still not make it to the state finals
6615874 they want to make sure they dont experience that again
6615875 shes putting in a whole lot of work to become a better runner this offseason
6615876 during the first nine miles of her marathon she was pacing herself at about six and a half minutes per mile thats pretty good
6615877 we have a lot of inexperience mixed with a lot of experience on this team
6615878 were projecting to do a lot better than last season but that all depends on getting the girls to bond as a team if they do that they will train better and good things will happen
6615879 ive always had a passion for running and i felt the time was right to finally stop teasing the coaches about running during the season
6615880 water polo was just a little too aggressive for me in cross country when i push myself hard i can actually see results

6615896 the race was definitely different from any other in my career
6615897 i had more thoughts go through my head in that race than ever before
6615898 when i turned at the 50 meter mark and saw how far ahead he was for a few seconds i thought this is impossible then i felt myself catching him and i changed my mindset with about 15 meters to go i realized he was fading and i got a surge of adrenaline like ive never felt in my life it was really difficult to tell if i had outtouched bernard but with everyones reaction it was obvious we had won
6615899 me and my family are really big fans of swimming so we were jumping up and down on the couch as lezak started to come from behind
6615900 i was more nervous for lezak because i had met him
6615901 just as in the case with the other relay i didnt go into it worrying about michael
6615902 i went into it trying to win the gold medal as a team of four and as a part of team usa it was a great way to end the olympics
6615903 when he talked to us at the banquet he was about 32 years old and still hadnt medaled in an individual event
6615904 so what he preached to us was even if you dont accomplish your dreams at an early age dont give up i was so happy for him when his goals were accomplished

6615928 before we began the bike ministry four years ago we noticed an alarming trend among the young people in the neighborhood
6615929 there were 16 different nationalities represented here then there may be more than that now
6615930 and once we got them together and riding together and fixing bikes together suddenly they were calling each by name instead of calling each other names
6615931 to look back and see how god used this ministry you have to say wow god has done some great things here
6615932 this bike ministry helps these kids reclaim their neighborhood for them a bike means everything is possible and they are no longer locked in one place
6615933 it helps someone learn responsibility and to take care of things biking brings the community together
6615934 we are here to build relationships with the children and families in this neighborhood
6615935 this saturday bike ride has become an appointment for many of these children
6615936 god gave us broken bicycles and a broken community and he has given us the opportunity to be a part of putting them back together
6615937 you think that long wait for christmas morning and presents took forever you aint seen nothin yet pal
6615938 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
6615939 i see this man pulling this long gun from under his shirt and he started shooting i just couldnt believe it some people thought it was firecrackers but i knew different i saw the little girl rubbing her leg and the boy with blood coming out of his head
6615940 opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
6615941 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
6615942 we need to keep the young people off the streets
6615943 and the parents need help the law is the law
6615944 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
6615945 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones
6615946 the children cant stay in their homes because of what their mothers are doing behind the bedroom door they are having sex the boys especially have a big problem with that every kid i know who is in trouble its always the same story they cant handle their mothers boyfriends
6615947 i hope it works but i think its going to cause a lot of trouble a lot of kids are going to end up being locked up i bet you
6615948 i just cant be there thats all they cant coop us up like that its not right
6615949 i really dont care about it i will still be outside anyways
6615950 how the whole et thing would go down in our home
6615951 the district has a legal contract to purchase that property but the terms of the contract between pardee and the school district could be modified if everyone agrees to it
6615952 we are and have been in discussions with the various parties involved
6615953 i think the city pardee and the school district will have a lot to talk about in coming weeks
6615954 id like all three parties to check their egos at the door to get into some serious business and think about the communitys interest and not their self interest
6615955 as a homeowner its devastating to have a promise taken away but buying a vacant lot isnt a desirable option either
6615956 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security

6615958 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6615959 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed
6615960 what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6615961 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6615962 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6615963 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6615977 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of their business
6615978 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state directly available from china by clicking on the links above rise to a level of evidence higher than allegations
6615979 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6615980 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes

6615986 how many times does maury povich have four guys on his tv show take dna tests and
6615987 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6615988 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6615989 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6615990 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6615991 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6615992 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6615993 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6615994 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6615995 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6615996 americas defense line the justice departments battle to register the israel lobby as agents of a foreign government
6615997 the injury of the united states or to the advantage of a foreign country
6615998 in the early 1960s the attorney general found that the israel lobby was acting as an unregistered foreign agent for israel and ordered it to register nevertheless after a similar three year period of delays and appeals aipacs predecessor was allowed to file a secret foreign agents registration act fara statement our nations first exception to that very important public disclosure law forcing todays prosecutors to operate under a higher standard of evidence smacks of institutionalized preferential treatment for a lobby that has serially engaged in activities harmful to the united states

6616005 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
6616006 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
6616007 i think the problem with most sleep adjustment strategies is that they involve an iron self control just at those times when one is at ones weakest sure it is all good and well to suggest offering an older baby a pat on the back or your warmest assurances of love and good times on the morrow but when someone tries to mug me i give them my wallet youll go back to sleep if i feed you done
6616008 those who want to transact business with us are always very suspicious
6616009 the nigerian government frowns very seriously on these scams and every day tries to track down those who are involved

6616012 talking to an aging parent about driving is a very sensitive issue but adult children need to have these conversations to avoid a dangerous situation for their loved ones and for society at large
6616013 with our senior driving population growing there will be more drivers over the age of 75 potentially causing serious safety issues on our roads
6616014 as a nation we must do more to promote mature driver safety through better education self evaluation tools refresher driving courses and more options for public transportation

6616016 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6616017 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6616018 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6616019 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6616020 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation

6616045 though the anthology paints an honest yet bleak picture of academia it is not all gloom and doom some women do find ways to make it work though a few had partners able to share equally in the child care others such as the single mothers are down right heroic in their abilities to balance their work hours with raising a family but the essays that tugged at me most were the ones where the unrelenting demands of academia had permanently derailed these brilliant and talented mothers from attaining the holy grail a tenured position at a major research university these pieces were an unpleasant reminder of the number of brain cells lost to society when we dont accommodate parents
6616046 it was a very open sometimes brutally frank look at the academy and essentially how it fails women who want to also have a family
6616047 i think this book should be required reading for any woman going into any sort of graduate education program and their partners

6616111 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6616112 now that both houses of the california legislature have voted in favor of employment rights for medical marijuana patients the onus is on governor schwarzenegger to do the right thing
6616113 the governor has a chance to include medical marijuana patients as productive members of society thereby protecting the jobs of thousands of californians with serious illnesses such as cancer and hiv aids
6616114 ab2279 is not about being under the influence while at work thats against the law and will remain so
6616115 its about allowing patients who are able to work safely and who use their doctor recommended medication in the privacy of their own home to not be arbitrarily fired from their jobs
6616116 the voters who supported proposition 215 did not intend for medical marijuana patients to be forced into unemployment in order to benefit from their medicine
6616117 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable

6616127 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6616128 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6616129 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6616130 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6616131 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6616132 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6616133 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6616134 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6616135 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6616136 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern

6616154 todays 5 4 percent crude oil price increase to 121 18 a barrel despite decreased demand and increased supply is a clear sign that speculators continue to dominate the commodities markets hurting our national economy
6616155 there is absolutely no economic reason for prices to increase the way they did today
6616156 the commodities market is disconnected from reality and economic fundamentals like supply and demand are brushed aside speculators are in the drivers seat and theyre driving our economy right over the cliff
6616157 in just a day or two consumers in washington state and nationwide will pay the price for what speculators have done today its yet another clear example of why congress must pass legislation to address speculation as soon as possible
6616158 after meeting personally today with attorney general andrew cuomo and north american securities administrators association president karen tyler i am pleased to report that we have reached an amicable resolution and global settlement of this matter

6616174 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6616175 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6616176 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6616177 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6616178 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation

6616188 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6616189 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6616190 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
6616191 weve never had a complaint from a customer about people spamming them because of their idisk public folder name there is no way to remove your account name from the idisk folders im very sorry

6616200 going back to my philosophy for street fighter the game is essentially a tool not just a unique piece of entertainment i think of it like chess that game can be played anywhere as long as people want to play street fighter 4 it could be on anything even this iphone for that matter points to the iphone on the table it really could be on any platform that could support it so lets just see what happens

6616203 this december will be very important for us we expect to be over half way by january
6616204 this puts it in a price range that is quite accessible for the new zealand market it starts to become a why not purchase

6616206 we think that this christmas there will be a lot of buzz worthy titles for consumers
6616207 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6616208 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6616209 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans

6616221 we believe topshop customers will appreciate the detail and workmanship of our line and feel good about wearing a genuine piece of americana
6616222 were really excited to be collaborating with j brand topshop has established a reputation for producing its own new leading edge jeans and were proud to build on this by working with the original cult jeans brand j brand
6616223 maybe its not where an athletes from that makes us root for them maybe its not the flag on their back or the anthem that we hear when they win that makes us cheer maybe its simply that they are human and we are human and when they succeed we succeed
6616224 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat sic party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had

6616228 if users are frustrated with a platform theyre going to be more likely to go out and snag any update that purports to fix the problems
6616229 windows xp users were generally happy with service pack 2
6616230 there was not a huge clamor for windows xp sp3 like there was for vista sp1 and that shows in the results its pretty clear that a lot of xp users are very content with sp2
6616231 they heavily promoted vista sp1 and went out of their way to put a good foot forward for it but they barely mentioned xp sp3
6616232 youtube and google have adopted a policy that forces copyright owners like viacom to shoulder the entire burden of monitoring for copyright infringement
6616233 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6616234 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional we sincerely regret that this error affected your video we note that
6616235 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6616236 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6616237 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6616238 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6616239 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it
6616240 i saw the flames and the kids were all i thought about because they were all panicking
6616241 it started out small and in just no time it got huge there was lots of smoke you couldnt even see it was pretty bad
6616242 she was keeping the kids piled up with her my girlfriend leurette labobe was in with the two other kids when they got out i took them down and she came down with me
6616243 i always talked about it with my buddies and they always told me the same thing get the baby first she probably would have been dead right now because of the smoke the little lungs on her
6616244 that is a big complex and the fast response by const abraham and the assistance by joseph sylvester and other residents certainly helped to save lives there last night
6616245 the scary part about that is at three in the morning there are people in the building and the fire is set outside your exit it was pretty bold to go out at that hour of the morning at an exit with young people kids and families in the building
6616246 dont talk to me i am being naughty to you
6616247 the quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten
6616248 the quality is discovered right around the time the price sinks in
6616249 i want to be the first man to run a 42
6616250 piece of crap broke after 15 minutes of riding was hopping a curb and it broke wouldnt handle a 5 year old etc etc
6616251 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6616252 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6616253 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6616254 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6616255 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6616256 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6616257 it is very important that we ensure the public has a reasonable amount of time to provide input on our proposed changes to school board governance
6616258 because of vacations and summer schedules we decided our deadline may be difficult for some groups and individuals to meet
6616259 to take the democratic process out of the school board system is a mistake
6616260 if a disruptive member of the board is removed a byelection is the only manner to impartially identify a replacement
6616261 dont worry bro we all get that shriveled limp dick shit every now and then it never happened to me though thats gotta suck

6616268 its possible hell pitch again in a couple of weeks
6616269 one can not advise without listening and one can not listen while judging
6616270 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6616271 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6616272 it is a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6616273 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6616274 subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the united states
6616275 the court finds on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the british security service facilitated it
6616276 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6616277 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6616278 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6616279 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
6616280 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily

6616287 its a great opportunity for people in the health service to contribute their views

6616290 we did i think a good job with the wii last year but were doing a great job this year because this is where the casual audience is the mass audience is here its a great control system but youve got to learn to use it
6616291 i think the biggest learning we had this year is that you port your controls up as opposed to down

6616295 the wire service does send us stories from other regional papers and we need and use those but frankly why should we pay for that most of the regional editors with whom im discussing the situation would be happy to develop our own free web based content sharing system that idea already is taking shape in other parts of the country and we can obtain most of what we need in business and sports from far cheaper services

6616301 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6616302 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6616303 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6616304 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6616305 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6616306 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6616307 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6616308 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6616309 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6616310 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6616311 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6616312 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6616313 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that

6616331 the use of lists of words including individual names subjects locations et cetera has long been one of the methods used to sort out information of foreign intelligence value from that which is not of interest in the past such lists have been referred to occasionally as watch lists because the lists were used as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable intelligence interest however these lists generally did not contain names of u s citizens or organizations the activity in question is one in which u s names were used systematically as a basis for selecting messages including some between u s citizens when one of the communicants was at a foreign location
6616332 indicating that he was concerned with respect to the propriety of requests for information concerning u s citizens which nsa had received from the fbi and secret service he wrote the following

6616352 american sigint had been surprised by the coup as had american intelligence in general
6616353 in the mad scramble for positioning that followed the viet cong in the nam bo saigon region directed subordinate elements to help soldiers officers and others politicians and security personnel involved in the coup to escape
6616354 were the communists on to something there is no doubt that they were correct in their assessment that the americans were disillusioned with diems failure to select a course of social reform and stick with it

6616369 the congress determined that it was inadvisable for the united states to continue supporting any foreign police organizations
6616370 the criminal divisions international criminal investigative training assistance program icitap and overseas prosecutorial development assistance and training opdat office foster support and strengthen democratic principles and structures of law enforcement in foreign countries particularly in those countries that have recently embraced democracy icitap and opdat provide training for police prosecutors and the judiciary and advice on american laws and programs to combat crime within a democratic framework
6616371 janice stromsem a career employee of the justice department who served as icitaps director resisted the programs takeover by cia elements in february 1999 stromsem was relieved of her duties after complaining to the justice department inspector general that icitap was being used by the cia to recruit agents among foreign police officials
6616372 could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police
6616373 some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military
6616374 the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems such as when icitap pays for students attending the fbi academy
6616375 travel expenses salaries and expendable items such as course materials
6616376 also gao could not always determine whether a student was a police officer or a military member because some agencies do not collect such data dod officials informed us that once they receive permission to train police in a specific activity they do not provide a further accounting breakdown for example training provided to the eastern caribbean regional security system was for law enforcement personnel although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations
6616377 the effect of the various pieces of legislation and resulting programs is that there is a lot of disparate police training and some interagency competition but without anyone in charge the coordinator believes that this does not serve u s interests he stated that a policy coordinating committee coordinates all antiterrorism assistance delivered by participating agencies such as the fbi and the state department he noted however that the committee does not coordinate with agencies providing police training outside of the ata umbrella in addition although inm dea and the other agencies providing narcotics control assistance coordinate with each other officials informed us that they do not routinely coordinate with ata or icitap on police assistance activities
6616378 for example the ata program generally is coordinated through the embassys regional security officer while icitap generally coordinates its activities through a political officer or directly with the ambassador and dea manages its programs through either an in country attache or a special narcotics coordinator

6616399 zavvi are the latest in a long line of big businesses desperate to hide this from their customers
6616400 if wed called the game kill the terrorists we wouldnt have any problems but its politically sensitive and thats what this is about
6616401 youve got to ask yourself why do zavvi feel the need to protect their customers from a board game that is critical of war and violence when they have no problem pushing computer games that celebrate and reward brutal and aggressive behaviour
6616402 i saw pictures of the board game in papers and was absolutely baffled
6616403 surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
6616404 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well

6616412 he had no idea until sunday he had any problem nor did we or anyone else
6616413 his family and i were the only ones who knew gene had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer
6616414 i think gene is one of the most pivotal people in the history of the nfl
6616415 players past and present had no better friend than gene upshaw with time people will come to fully understand and appreciate his contributions and his legacy it was genes strength and conviction that got the players to where they are today
6616416 i would say no life is easily reduced to one issue and we had our issues and hes caused some suffering but theres still some humanity and our hearts and prayers go out to his family
6616417 upshaw was an easy target but the problem was bigger than him it is the institution itself and the commissioner he would be the pi ata and take the beating and make it seem that one man was taking the shots but the problem is more than just him
6616418 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players

6616427 we need to try to continue what gene did and thats have labor peace

6616487 to be or not to be kosher is the question
6616488 my only point is that others who did the same but were not notable were not similarly treated or targeted by the defense in the palfrey litigation
6616489 to put it plainly these expenses are the result of some pretty unofficial activities
6616490 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6616491 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6616492 for obvious reasons of security we will not comment further on the detail of our activities with security explorations
6616493 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present

6616504 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing it feels like when were going out there its tough
6616505 we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley but we will get there its about getting confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6616506 of course we need a big win to get the fans onside thats what we want to see and its what the fans want to see
6616507 and everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a perishable crown but we for an imperishable crown
6616508 most men are very handsome harry in my class is very handsome he is too handsome to fit with me
6616509 yes i am very beautiful but only until you hear my voice
6616510 it is devastating to have a significant reduction or comparatively less investment in r amp d in new zealand it is going to come back to haunt you guaranteed
6616511 we dont get to be innovative unless we put emphasis on those disciplines that create positive gdp growth
6616512 that is a very sobering statistic it is just a matter of time before we will become less competent we dont get innovation unless we have people who are competent
6616513 its probably the linchpin for innovation over the next 10 or 20 years in new zealand
6616514 the next hand you raise on me you will lose
6616515 like many other believers ive noticed the most common theme among the emergent emerging seeker sensitive and purpose driven church growth apostates is their man centered gospel
6616516 unfortunately so many of those 47 blogging ebooks seem to leave you frustrated and disappointed so when i was planning the ballistic blogging range i thought lets take on the opposition with a free version
6616517 since those disappointing 47 blogging ebooks tell you how to start but then leave you high and dry i decided it was time for a new approach as blogging comes of age
6616518 instead the free ballistic blogging report is only the introduction to the system that looks set to redefine blogging for profit theres an interim 7 version that buyers can resell and keep all 7 but the main product is called the ballistic blogging toolkit this includes video tutorials to show you how a blueprint to follow to get started and then monthly updates of new blueprints help and advice
6616519 im really excited about the new dimension that ballistic blogging monthly will bring as it will provide new ideas advice and guidance each and every month so that ballistic blogging toolkit owners can repeat these techniques time and time again giving them free web traffic for life
6616520 i had like five personalities on the golf course last thursday
6616521 i told my caddie i could literally walk off the golf course and not think twice
6616522 my caddie kind of jumped in my face which was a good thing walking onto the 14th tee box
6616523 he said if youre not going to play for yourself then do it for the kids in africa
6616524 after a trip like that i still think about wearing a cleaner pair of shoes and there are kids who dont even have shoes
6616525 hello did africa not teach you anything its very hard to break what weve been believing
6616526 i think like a lot of people out here she just didnt believe
6616527 youre in pinehurst playing golf missing a week of school
6616528 i just gave myself a lot of birdie putts i didnt make some but being on the green and having a chance for birdie kind of forced rickie especially when i got ahead a little bit
6616529 because he knew he had to make birdies to beat me because i was on the green constantly and having birdie putts
6616530 i want to keep winning dont have any expectations i just go out and play and tomorrow ill be ready to play im going to get some good rest tonight and eat a whole bunch and be ready to go tomorrow
6616531 thats great for the team because everybodys fighting for spots that makes everybody better
6616532 see you at the brickyard osus first college event of the season
6616533 i think this would give him a good chance to be picked
6616534 we learned a lot from watching what patrick went through last season in recruiting
6616535 it was a big and trying experience for him and we learned from it
6616536 right now hes open we will start setting up visits in three weeks or so i know he will go to gainesville unofficially for the florida miami game thats it for now
6616537 it will be a tough deal for a few days
6616538 hes been a close friend of mine for 20 years
6616539 i think he was a real servant to the league he did great things and the league is a lot better now than before he took over hell be missed
6616540 im pretty sure theyre probably thinking about that and dont want that to happen again but its preseason its time to get work this is a time where we really perfect our craft and this is a time to test yourself especially for myself this being my first preseason game
6616541 its a learning experience theyre going to have some tough games but theyre excellent athletes and theyre great competitors and theyre learning every day on the job
6616542 champs in good shape champs had a good week theres been no setback and hes practiced every day so im sure hes looking forward to playing his first game
6616543 were not putting extra pressure on ourselves but we definitely want to get some momentum going into the season
6616544 we realize the last game a lot of times is just polish for one or two series maybe stay healthy get out of the game and let the younger guys play
6616545 i watched and learned knowing i would be a starter as a junior it really helped me out a lot this year should be much easier for me
6616546 last year i was more of a runner this year its throw first but i can run i really believe that i am a great runner and i love it a lot this season i will throw it a lot more
6616547 i loved illinois they have a nice campus i like their system and i love coach mike locksley i know if you work hard in that system you can make it illinois is on the rise they made it to the rose bowl ron zook has really turned them around
6616548 i love the memphis quarterback coach hes a cool guy i had a good camp and i also i work out with them memphis loves to air it out and they have some good receivers
6616549 i grew up a gator fan and i love that offense but i started too really like them when they had chris leak and ron zook that offense was good and i liked the way they aired it out and the players they had i am really hoping they recruit me
6616550 the bottom line is that i know i need to put up big stats my junior season and i hope they come calling

6616553 i literally had to beg cee lo to listen to my music but once he did he signed on immediately
6616554 we wrote and recorded t o n y and sandcastle disco that same week producer jack splash joined in to produce two more songs for me wouldve been the one and ode to marvin my special take on mr gay es whats going on both of which i wrote with splash and makeba
6616555 by the end of the project i had worked with all of the producers and artists i had ever dreamed of including q tip boards of canada and mark ronson
6616556 when i got a call saying the legendary lamont dozier would take the time out to write with little old me i was ecstatic beyond words
6616557 peacekeepers tried to contact them but their signals were ignored
6616558 as they were retreating georgians left behind documents including a detailed map of the positioning of the peacekeeping battalion and surrounding area based on space recognizance data with a resolution of 1 5000
6616559 the peacekeepers had been standing the attack for more than a day and a half only after the buildings were almost completely destroyed did they retreat under mortar fire losing soldiers
6616560 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
6616561 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
6616562 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
6616563 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
6616564 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
6616565 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
6616566 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
6616567 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
6616568 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
6616569 the georgian example has inspired americans and american leaders in their dedication to democracy its really about shared values and its something that sen mccain feels particularly deeply
6616570 the fact is john mccains campaign is being run by washington lobbyists and paid for with their money
6616571 its such a special golf course i like the greens theyre similar to home i like the par 5s if you can get good drivers you can reach a few of them and make it exciting and have some eagle chances
6616572 i would say the last few months have been a little trying
6616573 its been busy lately seems like ive been everywhere im running on the last bit of gas i have in the tank
6616574 we support the decision the lpga and sponsors decision to go to the next place
6616575 theyve always made changes with the growth of our tour
6616576 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6616577 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6616578 but he talks in generalities and he talks about nice things and he has nice rhetoric and the young people say hey that sounds pretty good but when they study the issues they come our way
6616579 i wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution i would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government i mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing i now deny their power of making paper money or anything else a legal tender i know that to pay all proper expenses within the year would in case of war be hard on us but not so hard as ten wars instead of one for wars could be reduced in that proportion besides that the state governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas

6616594 its possible hell pitch again in a couple of weeks
6616595 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6616596 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6616597 when im out there i would hope that our teams a lot more confident that we can make big plays and when its nut cutting time they know the balls coming to me and i can make a play for us
6616598 hes always one of the top receivers in the league possibly the best receiver in the league
6616599 but he doesnt start out with the ball in his hands so its up to us to make sure he doesnt see the ball too often
6616600 it should be a very intense game and hopefully not too high scoring
6616601 hes one of those big play guys that you need to have on your team
6616602 hes the mvp of the league hes the best player on our team and just having him on the field just brings more attention to him and gets receivers jason clermont myself and clarence coleman more time to do things with the ball
6616603 its going to take the pressure off me and the double teams i feel that geroy and myself are the best two short side together on the field so having him out is just going to make my job a lot easier and hopefully i can make his job easier
6616604 just knowing that hes going to be out there on the field you know hes going to draw a lot of attention defensively so whether or not hes getting the ball or other receivers it just opens up things more for your team
6616605 its just being a manager of the game taking care of the ball making good decisions eating popcorn and watching guys like the top receiver in the west make plays on the other side
6616606 they pin their ears back early on and they try to get after the quarterback make big plays and cause turnovers
6616607 we were physical and we were able to chop down some of those guys up front were a physical team that plays hard
6616608 they bring this mindset that they think theyre tougher than us so we have to bring that mindset too
6616609 guys were picking themselves up off the ground left and right and if you dont have a bad taste in your mouth from that game you shouldnt be playing football
6616610 if shit pop off somebody going to get laid the fuck out
6616611 hey people will know this is a joke i can be goofy about it
6616612 we build with passion and pride to withstand the test of time
6616613 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6616614 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6616615 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6616616 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6616617 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6616618 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6616619 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6616620 since youre the ones who are selling the soap i thought youd like to see the

6616624 but before you rush off to volunteer in fordhams army consider the following passage from fareed zakarias
6616625 im surprised that there hasnt been more action by the rudd government in the past 12 months
6616626 all we can do as a council is reflect the views of our community and the majority are saying no extension
6616627 when daylight savings was first introduced it took many people in rural areas time to adjust their lifestyles to it
6616628 another change is not warranted extending the period will only make it harder for farmers to get work done and school children getting to school in the mornings
6616629 has no set opinion as this matter does not relate to councils core business
6616630 ano passado a gente vendia o quilo a r 80 00 hoje s chega a r 35 00 r 40 00 os insumos para a pesca e a ado o da rede manzu aumentaram nossos custos
6616631 it will encourage other countries of the region and beyond to follow suit
6616632 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6616633 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
6616634 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
6616635 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately
6616636 as far as i know we have not seen that problem

6616644 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6616645 i dont think playing for england is a very enjoyable experience at the moment
6616646 players do want to play for england because playing for your country is the pinnacle of your career
6616647 but sometimes you wonder just how enjoyable it is because theres so much flak i think it just doesnt look a very enjoyable experience for anybody at the moment players fans or managers somehow we have to change that
6616648 when i started playing for england in the 1990s i did enjoy it but later in my international career there were times when while i wouldnt say you played with fear you did know that if things started to go wrong then the fall out from that was going to be very intense
6616649 we get the biggest crowds of any country for our friendlies but the flip side is that the intensity of being in the spotlight is huge
6616650 we seem to be locked in a cycle of massive build up to the game massive downturn during the game after something goes wrong and a massive inquest afterwards

6616654 the committee recommended the government review the suitability of the base pension levels through economic analyses of amounts required to achieve at least a modest standard of living for retired australians
6616655 the pension discussion paper released this week will not report until february 2009 and will then fold into labors overall review of the taxation system which is due to report in late 2009 which means there will be no decision on pensions before the 2010 budget at the earliest
6616656 this honor reflects mattels strong commitment to providing a great work environment for its employees because it is their creativity and talent that enables mattel to design develop and market fun and innovative toys
6616657 were pleased that mattel is recognized among the hundreds of companies considered
6616658 a lot of it is highly organised its not opportunistic
6616659 most of it happens in daylight people turn up with a truck and no one thinks to question it
6616660 its certainly a crime that is up there at the moment
6616661 well theyre sacrificing theyre lives for us why cant we sacrifice a little bit for them too theyre fighting for the freedom of our country and if we can help them come home safe this is one way i can help
6616662 i understood there was a real urgent need for the blood donations so i asked them would they be willing to drive this 48 foot unit here for our people to participate and they were more than happy to do it
6616663 i cant be there with them but i can do my part by giving them my blood
6616664 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6616665 one of the challenges we face is to make the case that while we are in a period of warming we should not expect every year to be the warmest year on record
6616666 already possess all the tools required to avoid catastrophic climate change
6616667 for the same reason dr seuss counsels his readers to sing with a ying or play ring the gack these things are fun and fun is good
6616668 from my own point of view the fact of the third reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of christian superiority except in technological terms
6616669 the future historian will rank him as one of the heroes of the nineteenth century
6616670 one of the bravest grandest champions of human liberty the world has ever seen
6616671 freedom was what he preached he wanted the shackles off everywhere
6616672 his life and work have been an inspiration to the whole earth
6616673 depth and complexity of living nature still exceeds human imagination
6616674 how would the rest of nature respond if it were suddenly relieved of the relentless pressures we heap on it and our fellow organisms how soon would or could the climate return to where it was before we fired up all our engines how long would it take to recover lost ground and restore eden to the way it must have gleamed and smelled the day before adam or homo habilis appeared could nature ever obliterate all our traces
6616675 it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees
6616676 is accessible to all and can inform ones existence with a sense of beauty reason and awe as enriching as anything to be found in music art or poetry
6616677 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6616678 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep
6616679 we would welcome further research in this area to establish why exposure to these risk factors causes some children to become snorers in later life

6616681 usually in people taking moderate doses of the drug you see some sort of mild acne but in severe cases it can ulcerate
6616682 the doses this man was taking were within the doses that are used among bodybuilders
6616683 there is probably a dose effect with the steroids but its also dependent on how the individual reacts
6616684 it is questionable whether he will be able to start building muscle mass again he may not be able to perform the exercises due to the scarring
6616685 its well documented that some individuals can experience severe acne
6616686 often this is just a transient problem most people wouldnt consider it a significant barrier to using anabolic steroids
6616687 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
6616688 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
6616689 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
6616690 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour
6616691 however we must acknowledge the long term medical risks such as transplant rejection and the need for life long medication associated with the procedure there is also the potential of psychological impact following such a transplant

6616717 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6616718 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6616719 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6616720 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6616721 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6616722 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6616723 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6616724 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6616725 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6616726 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6616727 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6616728 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6616729 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6616730 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6616731 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6616732 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6616733 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6616734 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6616735 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6616736 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6616737 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6616738 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6616739 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6616740 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6616741 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6616742 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6616743 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6616744 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6616745 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6616746 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6616747 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6616748 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6616749 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6616750 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6616751 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6616754 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6616755 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6616756 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6616757 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6616759 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6616760 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6616764 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6616765 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6616766 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6616767 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6616768 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6616769 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6616770 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6616771 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6616772 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6616773 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6616774 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6616775 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6616776 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6616777 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6616778 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6616779 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6616780 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6616781 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6616782 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6616783 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6616784 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6616785 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6616786 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6616787 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6616788 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6616789 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6616790 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6616791 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6616792 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6616795 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6616796 i can understand legitimate questions like rubbing concerns but it seems like some of the noobs just want someone else to tell them what mods to do to their car i feel like the gen 5 6 section is going downhill fast
6616797 looking at the political situation in the united states the international community other parts of the world and in israel there is a kind of expectations to do something before the end of the year
6616798 i think that any attempt to try and bridge gaps that might be premature to reach or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances are in a way are similar

6616809 the brew of choice for mountain bikers and adventurous types worldwide are you excited now this fiery red ale is not for the weak at heart it originally started out as a scottish red ale but has taken on flavors of its own this is a very complex recipe using five different grains to achieve its unique flavor the caramel malt used is a mixture of belgian caravienne and hugh bairds crystal malts red rocket is a full bodied hoppy brew which finishes on the pallet with caramel malts centennial and cascade hops are used for bittering and aroma
6616810 this is a hoppy ipa did i say hops your brewer is a hop head this is a full bodied beer using american grains the goal was to create a base for showing off the unique floral qualities of two pacific northwest hops columbus and cascade columbus is a new hybrid high alpha acid hop used mostly for bittering but used heavily as an aromatic in this strong brew cascade is the balance that ties the malt and bittering hops together it is a true specialty ale and is our brewers statement on this style
6616811 essentially a strong american ipa made with 20 rye malt darker in color hop rod rye boasts a huge hop aroma and flavor accompanied by a slightly sweet malty finish

6616833 we have been made aware of a serious breach of security at the offices of external contractors a full search has been conducted and both the police and information commisioner have been informed
6616834 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information is held securely at all times
6616835 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6616836 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6616837 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6616838 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6616839 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6616840 right now there are not many good options for these people
6616841 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6616842 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6616843 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6616844 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6616845 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6616846 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6616847 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6616848 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6616849 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

6616853 funding and attention to the issue of alcohol sales to underage youth has made a difference
6616854 communities and states need to continue working to prevent sales to underage youth however more resources and attention also need to be focused on preventing alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6616855 so its not as healthy as the name suggests frozen yogurt usually lower in fat than most ice creams but it also has lots of added sugar in order to use the name yogurt in frozen yogurt it does have to have the law requires that it have the live active cultures that yogurt does have
6616856 this sort of led the rage of yogurt in the 80s what i like about tcby is it has about 20 percent of your calcium needs in half of a cup and there are actually seven probiotics in it those healthy cultures however it still is so easily over consumed there is corn syrup added so theres extra added sugar and a half a cup adds up fast most people have at least two to three times that and theyre eating it every night after dinner thinking its healthy its just yogurt it needs to be a replacement for a treat
6616857 lots of flavor smooth and creamy hundreds of flavors its all natural there no artificial sweetener but its not yogurt they dont claim to be yogurt they are a dairy frozen desert i like that its all natural
6616858 its so popular so im going to have to say its not as healthy as it is popular people think because of their two flavors the tart plain and the green tea theyre such healthy flavors that oh theyre just as healthy as eating regular yogurt regular plain yogurt versus the pinkberry is going to have a lot more calcium a lot more protein a lot less sugar and a many fewer calories so you still need to be really careful when youre eating pinkberry it is a treat it should be a replacement for your ice cream indulgence
6616859 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6616860 doesnt surprise me at all doesnt surprise me because as you get people who dont fully immunize their children were going to see more and more cases like this and thats a very scary thing
6616861 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6616862 were more concerned about the rising rates of autism than contracting measles
6616863 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health

6616874 inspection this morning revealed that the majority of the remaining block of rock has fallen around 30 000 tonnes of it

6616888 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

6616890 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6616891 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6616892 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6616896 the big concern i have right now is our ability to provide updates
6616897 on the pc side weve done as many as four updates in a day and thats great we can respond very quickly if nvidia puts out a new graphics driver and it changes some way about how texture management works then before our customers know theres any issue then the problem has gone away or we can do the pyro updates and the medic updates and so on
6616898 on the consoles they want us to charge money for them because thats in their model and our model is very much more to grow the community by giving out free updates thats harder for us
6616899 the retail environment for carbonated beverages has reached a saturation point
6616900 were all just fighting for market share and it shouldnt be that way carbon isnt the only tool at our disposal the periodic table gives us 118 other elements we can use in the preparation of soda
6616901 the process of heliumating soda was similar to carbonating it
6616902 and the effect was potent the soda was a lot lighter and will be very popular with children since it gives the drinker a high pitched voice after being consumed
6616903 it adds a beautiful glow and if you drink it in the dark you can actually see it traveling down the throat itll be a great party drink
6616904 multiple preliminary offers from private equity firms and strategic buyers

6616907 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6616908 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6616909 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6616910 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6616911 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6616912 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6616913 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6616914 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6616915 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6616916 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6616917 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6616918 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6616919 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6616920 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6616921 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6616922 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6616923 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6616924 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6616925 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6616926 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6616927 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6616928 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

6616935 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6616936 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
6616937 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewelers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms
6616938 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
6616939 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6616940 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6616941 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6616949 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6616950 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6616951 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6616952 do that and youre going to lose the man you realize this right
6616953 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6616954 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6616955 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6616956 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6616957 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6616958 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6616959 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6616960 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6616963 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6616964 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6616965 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6616966 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6616967 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6616968 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6616969 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6616970 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6616971 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6616972 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6616973 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6616974 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6616975 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6616976 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

6616981 much of the disconnect and negative opinion on pre roll is a result of poorly executed campaigns that may not enforce frequency caps and involve longer ads delivered before short form ugc content
6616982 as a format itself pre roll is not bad its actually the most effective video ad format in terms of brand awareness and advertiser impact however a 30 second pre roll ad in front of a 20 second user generated video without any caps is a terrible user experience

6616990 we are faced with a growing amount of social challenges including an ageing population social exclusion and global warming to name a few designers need to adapt their skills to play a role in helping solving these challenges not by designing posters or products but by using their skills to involve people and communities in the problem solving process together we can understand how we can solve these big issues and design sustainable useful and usable solutions that work in different households communities regions and counties
6616991 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6616992 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6616993 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6616994 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6616995 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6616996 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6616997 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6616998 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6616999 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6617000 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation

6617009 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6617010 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6617011 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6617012 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6617013 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6617014 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6617015 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6617016 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6617053 i havent seen the new ben stiller movie tropic thunder and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
6617054 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word
6617055 we were always pretty clear with ourselves in terms of what the point of view was of where the comedy was coming from in the movie i stand behind the movie and i would hope that the people who have a difference with it first of all that the people who organized the protest would actually go see the movie cause in the context of the film i think its very clear that the humors at the expense of the actors and i in no way wanted to offend anybody with it
6617056 think outside your own little world look at those of us who have struggled i have a son who is 29 who has down syndrome
6617057 ive worked really hard to create his life and hes an actor and hes out there working as well and ben is not even considering that these people are trying to get work and do the same thing hes doing
6617058 i think anyone that sees the movie will see that its its just theres no harm meant to anyone and its just a very funny movie

6617065 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6617066 its a signal but we dont know what it means

6617075 gene blazed the trail he stood his ground for the players whether it was popular by public opinion or not
6617076 over 60 of the league was african american and there was so much talk about the lack of leadership from people who looked like us
6617077 there was a quiet pride we all felt when gene accomplished what he did because it set a tone you can do whatever you want to do with hard work
6617078 it was a very effective strategy and gene was a very effective leader at a turbulent time for the players association they were able to secure a number of important rights for the players it was a very courageous move
6617079 his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6617080 it has been because of gene upshaw that there have been so many benefits accruing to the players that they might not have gotten with a more adversarial relationship
6617081 were all business and never personal my sympathy goes to his family
6617082 he did a wonderful job for the current guys but not for the guys who built this league he came into the league as a player he went into the union and he never left the game i dont think he really had a feel for what was going on
6617083 with the two guys we had involved in different issues off the field chris henry gene was always very concerned about them and what he could do personally to help them to sit them down and confer with them and get them to understand why they were in the position they were in and what could he do to help them i found gene to be just tremendous
6617084 god only knows what gene knew and when he knew it because he never told anyone anything he was a heroic kind of character outsized you felt privileged to be his friend
6617085 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6617086 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6617087 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp
6617088 and if hes going to say one people one nation he can raise the banner of unity with her as his vice presidential running mate
6617089 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6617090 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6617091 some press accounts have contained statements faulting the fbi for dr bruce ivins suicide we disavow such speculation
6617092 we believe that ms lieber acted out of concern for his welfare
6617093 it is wrong to answer such speculation with similarly unfounded accusations and innuendo
6617094 if you spend a lot of time out in the evening youre going to start getting bit much more
6617095 even though we dont have any west nile virus in the county at this time were going to have the mosquitoes that transmit the virus in extremely high numbers for a while
6617096 here off weatherbee road the mosquitoes seem to be really bad because of the savannahs it just seems the larva has over populated
6617097 were being proactive here and are looking to make this business stronger by addressing redundancies and excess capacity
6617098 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we are obviously having conversations about resolution the one thing the people want is their money back quickly
6617099 we recognize the fact the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable
6617100 we are doing work behind the scenes and we are getting ourselves ready to play more offensively minded when it comes to getting traffic through the front doors
6617101 we are satisfied that the settlement is fair for both parties and are ready to put this one behind us
6617102 it is not surprising that travellers going to different places are looking for different web features
6617103 international travel searchers are becoming more specific in their online behaviours so that in addition to multilingual web optimisation global social media optimisation also needs to take place
6617104 it could be that those planning their trip to france already have an idea about where they want to go france is a well known destination and most of the time people have heard of paris or bordeaux
6617105 a site with properly optimised social media that is visible to a variety of cultures will prosper
6617106 some of those transnational managers they speak english although theyre generally latin americans they have a superiority complex
6617107 go see the pollution there is and not only in the trees along the coasts but in the lungs of boys and girls
6617108 incorporated modern technology in all in our operation units for prevention and environmental control
6617109 i wouldnt vote for obama under any circumstances he didnt earn his way to this position and has done nothing to deserve the presidency
6617110 michelle obama is probably the angriest most bitter person ive ever heard and she seems pretty racist
6617111 how many houses does mccain own amp why doesnt he even know
6617112 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6617113 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6617114 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6617115 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6617116 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6617117 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6617118 the obama people understand this issue they understand that the united states has to do things differently
6617119 the way in which the world is run is going to change over the next five years with the rise of china and india and with whats going on in russia its going to change dramatically if we dont take the lead on this im going to tell you what is going to happen the people who take the lead are going to forget about us pretty damn quickly
6617120 youre not going to dictate to us without us being at the table
6617121 issues cant be solved by americans talking to the europeans and the europeans talking to the canadians and that kind of thing the solution lies with the u s and others talking to china india brazil
6617122 how can i not talk about things like the sponsorship scandal
6617123 im the prime minister of a country of 28 million people
6617124 hes the president of a country with 1 2 billion im not allowed to tell the premier of saskatchewan or quebec what to do am i supposed to tell the president of china what to do
6617125 you want me to tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective
6617126 usain bolt and how its all about him right now
6617127 their patriarch is a former green beret who once worked as a bounty hunter in africa and later served as hustler publisher larry flynts personal valet jim bolen has been in more fistfights than he can remember was busted by the feds on an international gun running charge and got rich as a self made businessman before losing most of his savings when the housing bubble burst

6617130 gods purpose for our lives is to be found in scripture and not in experience
6617131 human experience is both the starting point and ending point of the circle of interpretation
6617132 the baptism in the holy spirit as the promise of the father a reformed perspective
6617133 i suppose the pragmatic denial of the spirits fundamental personhood is another reason my tradition doesnt trust spirit experiences
6617134 an absolutely fabulous vacation its the best family time weve ever had together
6617135 the unique approach of startme is that it takes the onus away from recruiting staff based on their level of training allowing us to focus on criteria such as personality and attitude
6617136 in a talent tight market we need to look at a different way of recruiting and take a different approach to training
6617137 and startme is an investment in the future of both our employees and accor encouraging ongoing study and staff retention
6617138 the first three months in any job can be intimidating and in many of these operational roles the staff are quite young so the step by step process of startme will do much to alleviate those new job nerves so they can concentrate on learning what they need to know
6617139 it will also ensure that a standardised set of skills is benchmarked across the accor hotel network so when staff move to another hotel there is less cross training required
6617140 we will clearly raise our standard and offer our guests a new first class experience
6617141 since we are located only one mile from chicago ohare airport we cater to everyday heroes
6617142 we are thrilled to have the only best western hotel in waikiki to offer guests
6617143 as the management company for coconut waikiki were excited to be part of best westerns global marketing reach and look forward to welcoming their gold crown club international members
6617144 this is a great opportunity for us to extend the aloha spirit to world travelers

6617148 in five ways should a wife be ministered to by a husband by being courteous to her by not despising her by being faithful to her by handing over authority to her the wife thus ministered to by her husband shows her compassion to her husband in five ways she performs her duties well she is hospitable to relations and attendants she is faithful she protects what he brings she is skilled and industrious in discharging her duties
6617149 if a man can find a suitable and understanding wife and a woman can find a suitable and understanding husband both are fortunate indeed
6617150 for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so then they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
6617151 wives submit to your husbands as to the lord because the husband is the head of the wife as also christ is the head of the church he himself being the savior of the body but as the church submits to christ so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything husbands love your wives just as and gave himself for her to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word so that he may present the church to himself as glorious not having a stain or wrinkle or any such blemish but holy and blameless in the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one has ever hated his own body but he feeds it and takes care of it just as christ also does the church for we are members of his body for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh this mystery is great but i am actually speaking with reference to christ and the church nevertheless each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself and the wife must respect her husband
6617152 and submitting to one another out of reverence for christ
6617153 prior to the widespread use of pesticides those in the health care community who advocated organic foods claimed that these foods contained a better arrangement of nutrients as a result of the superior soil management and fertilizer practices used by organic farmers as a corollary they cautioned that food grown with chemical fertilizers caused deleterious health in animals and humans
6617154 ninety five percent 95 of crops in the united states are now produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides and producing crops using these chemicals has come to be known as conventional agriculture
6617155 for example vitamin c is 17 more abundant in organic lettuce conventional 100 organic 117
6617156 uncontrollable factors such as rainfall and sunlight which also influence nutrient content
6617157 ninety five percent 95 of crops in the united states are now produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides
6617158 for each of the significant nutrients the organic crops had a higher nutrient content in more than half of the comparisons for the one toxic compound nitrates the organic crop had a lower content the majority of the time
6617159 first there appear to be higher amounts of nutritionally significant minerals in organic compared to conventional crops
6617160 for all four heavy metals considered the organic crop contained lower amounts of the heavy metals more often than comparable conventional crops
6617161 many compounds that help plants including substances such as citrate and lactate that combine with soil minerals and make them more available to plant roots the presence of these microorganisms at least partially explains the trend showing a higher mineral content of organic food crops
6617162 many compounds that help plants many combine with soil minerals and make them more available to plant roots the presence of these microorganisms at least partially explains the trend showing a higher mineral content of organic food crops
6617163 phosphate fertilizers often are contaminated by cadmium also trace mineral fertilizers and liming materials derived from industrial waste can contain a number of heavy metals
6617164 animal studies suggest that such functions as reproduction and resistance to infection might be adversely affected
6617165 reported that the percentage of normal sperm increased as the percentage of organic food in mens diets increased

6617169 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6617170 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6617171 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6617172 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy

6617175 the centres notification prioritises investments over environmental and social concerns
6617176 such abuse of the executive power of the union ministry is contradictory to the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments
6617177 the state should have taken a firm stand against the notification in 2006 when it was issued by the ministry
6617178 but since there were no debates in parliament on the notification the state assembly too did not discuss its implications i have been trying to propose a private resolution for the last two years and only now i got the opportunity to table it
6617179 what is important is not passing resolutions but the commitment of the state in conserving the environment
6617180 the state assembly had passed a resolution against the pampa achankovil vypar river linking project in 2003 but feasibility studies are still being carried out
6617181 satyagraha by the tribes and civil groups against the athirappally project has crossed 170 days

6617184 the fee has gone up to 250 more than 4 000 awards were granted this year
6617185 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6617186 it would lessen the stress on local bars there would be judiciaries who could be dealing with real crimes it would be easier on the administration
6617187 i used to think the same way until i became a navy wife and saw the people i was saying should be allowed to drink
6617188 you volunteered to give your life im not volunteering to die at your hands because youre trashed and driving drunk
6617189 we have to teach our young ones that this is a responsibility that you have treat it with respect
6617190 here drinking seems to be the main theme of the party
6617191 if its in the open much of the allure is gone
6617192 i never thought it was cool to drink it was never an exciting or daring thing to do
6617193 police say so and so died last night in a wreck

6617199 they have it in their mind to stay but they should leave
6617200 im terrified that as soon as theres any movement whatsoever of russians out of the area theres going to be a mass movement of ngos idps and journalists and if there are land mines people are going to get killed

6617209 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices

6617211 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day

6617221 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures
6617222 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6617223 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6617224 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form

6617255 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6617273 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6617274 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6617275 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6617276 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6617277 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6617278 right now there are not many good options for these people
6617279 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6617280 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice
6617281 it is not unreasonable to think that we can also do this in humans

6617303 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6617304 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6617305 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6617306 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6617307 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6617308 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health

6617312 its a high tech solution to problems that should be solved earlier in the food chain
6617313 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6617314 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6617315 funding and attention to the issue of alcohol sales to underage youth has made a difference
6617316 communities and states need to continue working to prevent sales to underage youth however more resources and attention also need to be focused on preventing alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6617317 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6617318 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6617319 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6617320 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6617321 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz mr smith said
6617322 were having discussions with the business council about the data they used the model they used we will take all that on board when we make our decisions in the national interest
6617323 there were different factors going on up there but i think the very strong message that comes out of it is dont take anything for granted
6617324 what we need to understand here is that this is a process which could deliver a barnett buswell government and it is extremely close it is extremely close
6617325 there is a very very real risk that colin barnett could be premier in two and a half weeks and troy buswell could be treasurer
6617326 im not playing im not playing this is real life stuff
6617327 i mean i dont know whether there are requirements for truth in advertising but its an absolute nonsense to suggest that brian burke organised things for me
6617328 but there is a question about brian burke if we want to talk about that
6617329 brian burkes influence in the liberal party was exposed during the liberal mp john mcgrath scandal
6617330 what happened absolutely nothing the liberal party havent dealt with it
6617331 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6617332 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6617333 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6617334 so its not as healthy as the name suggests frozen yogurt usually lower in fat than most ice creams but it also has lots of added sugar in order to use the name yogurt in frozen yogurt it does have to have the law requires that it have the live active cultures that yogurt does have
6617335 this sort of led the rage of yogurt in the 80s what i like about tcby is it has about 20 percent of your calcium needs in half of a cup and there are actually seven probiotics in it those healthy cultures however it still is so easily over consumed there is corn syrup added so theres extra added sugar and a half a cup adds up fast most people have at least two to three times that and theyre eating it every night after dinner thinking its healthy its just yogurt it needs to be a replacement for a treat
6617336 lots of flavor smooth and creamy hundreds of flavors its all natural there no artificial sweetener but its not yogurt they dont claim to be yogurt they are a dairy frozen desert i like that its all natural
6617337 its so popular so im going to have to say its not as healthy as it is popular people think because of their two flavors the tart plain and the green tea theyre such healthy flavors that oh theyre just as healthy as eating regular yogurt regular plain yogurt versus the pinkberry is going to have a lot more calcium a lot more protein a lot less sugar and a many fewer calories so you still need to be really careful when youre eating pinkberry it is a treat it should be a replacement for your ice cream indulgence
6617338 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
6617339 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
6617340 we didnt have any guns so he shot georgi in front of me without saying a word
6617341 a neighbour helped me to bury him in our garden and then i just fled
6617342 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression you stopped a full scale operation
6617343 thank you for standing in the way of those who brought destruction and death to the people of the republic
6617344 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
6617345 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
6617346 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
6617347 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
6617348 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
6617349 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
6617350 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
6617351 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
6617352 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
6617353 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
6617354 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
6617355 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
6617356 did they contact the rival and ask them to stop first or offer a compromise
6617357 even a moron in a hurry would never mistake one for the other
6617358 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
6617359 if a business is based on smooth icing cupcakes with a dot on a circle how will it do
6617360 im sure this is what the original creators of trademark law intended
6617361 its very nice to meet the fans in the united states and i know that when im hosted by comicspro stores its a first class affair the whole way

6617373 to expect a licensed engine fresh out of the box would require no modification or improvements to achieve development goals on a new title is ludicrous
6617374 but to build an entirely new engine as an alternative to improving an existing one sounds a bit unreasonable and to build that new engine inside 1 year then ship a title with it now things are starting to sound surreal

6617491 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6617492 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
6617493 this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6617494 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6617495 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change

6617526 chiquita says the reason they paid the money was because your people would kill them if they didnt is that true
6617527 they paid taxes because we were like a state in the area and because we were providing them with protection which enabled them to continue making investments and a financial profit
6617528 what would have happened to chiquita and its employees if they had not paid you
6617529 the truth is we never thought about what would happen because they did so willingly
6617530 yes they had a choice they could go to the local police or army for protection from the guerillas but the army and police at that time were barely able to protect themselves
6617531 dole and del monte say they never paid you any money
6617532 chiquita has been honest by acknowledging the reality of the conflict and the payments that it made the others also made payments not only international companies but also the national companies in the region
6617533 has anyone come down here from the united states to talk to you about dole or to talk to you about del monte or any other companies
6617534 no one has come from the department of justice of the united states to talk to us

6617554 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6617555 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6617556 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6617557 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6617558 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6617559 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6617560 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6617561 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6617562 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6617563 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6617564 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6617565 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are confident and the intelligent full of doubt

6617572 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6617573 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6617574 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6617575 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6617576 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6617577 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6617578 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential
6617579 youve definitely got to eat the food at the state fair and if you get to share with someone thats even better
6617580 you really get to hear whats on peoples mind and thats really important
6617581 too many people hide their heads in the sand and theyre not in touch with people what they need and what they want
6617582 we got a booth and this year were featuring my wife frannis apple pie recipe but i do plan to eat a lot of fried food myself
6617583 this is a good venue because you meet all kinds of people
6617584 weve had some conversions today from democrat s to republicans
6617585 i like the ocean and the kids love it here and i love that
6617586 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6617587 we are extremely excited about bringing the weei sports radio network brand to greater bangor
6617588 this area has a deep sports heritage ranging from the university of maine programs to an extremely active local high school sports scene they are very passionate about their new england sports teams as well and when it comes to sports nobody does it better than weei

6617605 obama needs to figure out how to advertise on a mass basis that goes beyond shots of him giving inspiring speeches and talking about change its pretty easy when youve got a charismatic candidate like barack obama to just sit there and go whoa this guys great lets do 30 seconds of him talking and thats really all theyve done
6617606 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different
6617607 all the momentum was on obamas side and they figured out a way to use that momentum to basically flip him
6617608 voters respond to them based on their own emotions and values whether its a candidate or a car there are certain attributes that drive voter decisions the goal is to make sure consumers understand that the candidate can be trusted that you can identify with the candidate that he or she shares your values
6617609 identification is a pretty significant driver for voters across the board republican and democrat
6617610 she did it by rolling up her sleeves doing events in pickup trucks riding in st patricks day parades
6617611 to protect this brand and continually reinforce its relevance to voters
6617612 youre experienced and have been around a long time thats the good news
6617613 the bad news is youre also seen as old flip it around and youre young and you bring new ideas and new energy at the same time you can be seen as inexperienced not ready for prime time
6617614 you cant change who you are but if you do have a perceived negative you link yourself to another brand which is another politician
6617615 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6617616 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from a vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6617620 ive been looking at things im not supposed to on the internet
6617621 continues to assert he only engaged in his criminal conduct to research people on the internet who trafficked in child pornography
6617622 he was eager to earn a book deal with his idea and was blinded by greed
6617623 mr wards distribution of child pornography involved no more than the noncommercial transfer of a few dozen images to other willing adult recipients all of whom appear to have been more regularly involved in this conduct

6617630 we are talking about the size of land equivalent to darwins northern suburbs zoned for development so there is what we call inland areas within that broader development footprint that could indeed be relevant to be downstream gas based industries such as the dow chemicals
6617631 it has rail it has roads it is certainly not ad hoc it is zoning that has been in place for decades it infrastructure that has been rolling into there for decades so it is hardly ad hoc
6617632 i did not have people coming to me saying you must support this industry
6617633 on the contrary i was overwhelmed with people suggesting that this is not compatible with the aspirations of this community
6617634 i came to the conclusion that it was time to make a stand and ask the government to also make a declaration that they would protect the community
6617635 it is time to get on with it and get this reform done
6617636 we wanted to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and they can participate with dignity when they use our facilities i think its a tangible demonstration of our commitment to diversity to formalize the policy
6617637 they were noticing that some of their customers were not participating in the water because they didnt feel comfortable wearing traditional swimwear young women and girls around the age of 12 would stop taking swimming lessons because they werent comfortable in traditional swimwear
6617638 as long as it doesnt create a danger for self and others as long as it doesnt pose an excessive burden financial or otherwise on the institution or employer then people should sit down and find ways to accommodate
6617639 we have always maintained that sport like any other social and cultural activity should always evolve and adapt to human diversity because its a question of how to encourage people to fully participate and still accommodate religious beliefs as long as whatever they want to do doesnt pose a threat to their own safety or the safety of others

6617665 these are two very important games for new zealand so its great to get to this point with selection options
6617666 i personally have never and the team hasnt either underestimated the challenge of these qualifying games new caledonia will provide a tough contest especially away from home
6617667 i really enjoy being able to travel places with dancing
6617668 it is a lot of fun and i hope i will be competing for a long time
6617669 the audiences are always clapping and cheering and it is a good feeling
6617670 i also really like doing the moves because they are a lot of fun
6617671 back when we first started glen innes was not in the rock n roll and swing scene but over the four years glen innes has grown to be the largest competition of its kind in australia
6617672 the most sought after prizes are the perpetual trophies which are sponsored by the glen innes and inverell business community as well as families from both areas
6617673 we are very grateful for their support along with the event sponsors and other enthusiasts
6617674 without them we would not be attracting the level of dancers that will be performing here
6617675 there is no waste and there is half as much work
6617676 i have had cattle for a long time and this is by far the best
6617677 it is also very healthy for them and contains eight per cent protein
6617678 we just turned it into silage and it is just fantastic to be able to do that
6617679 you can get so much good feed out of something that was once worthless
6617680 i am also very appreciative of darran for his advice
6617681 im pretty excited i wont say too much just in case i jinx myself but its going to be a challenge
6617682 im going to have to probably pull out one of my best defensive games against him because of his attacking prowess
6617683 they coughed up the ball due to the pressure our defence put on them
6617684 we still have to work in that area were maybe defending a bit too much maybe coughing up too much ball
6617685 were having to really be desperate on defence when we can ease the pressure a bit by holding on to the ball and getting down their end
6617686 but at the moment were pretty confident that any time we do make a mistake or when it comes time to step up and defend our line were right there
6617687 theyve got a pretty good side right across the park and they had a good win against the broncos up there last week
6617688 thats never an easy game so theyll be pretty confident and buoyed by that now theyre going home
6617689 were certainly going to be up against it but our biggest concern is making sure we get our own game on and carry on from what weve built recently and if we do that i think were a good chance
6617690 obviously weve played in some fairly average weather conditions over here the last few games but certainly if its dry its not going to hurt us too much
6617691 i joined up immediately not realising that on july 1 i had to see a specialist in tamworth
6617692 i rang nevat and i was told to be at inverell airport by 9 45am for a 10am departure
6617693 the flight was very scenic and i felt 100 per cent safe in the hands of david roach the pilot who assured me we had a first aid box on board i assured him that i had prayed for our safety
6617694 when we landed in tamworth a gentleman from the tamworth masonic lodge met us and took me to the hospital
6617695 he then came back for me an hour later and took me back to the aircraft i was back home in inverell by 2 30pm
6617696 had i travelled by car it would have taken me six hours at least i would have accepted the offer of a family member or friend to come with me and with the cost of petrol it would have cost a small fortune
6617697 harry potter moving out gave us an opportunity to get a little closer to the holidays which has always been the traditional bond spot
6617698 bond has a really good history of not only playing through thanksgiving but going deep into the christmas holidays
6617699 i can confirm that he has now left on the flight to london

6617721 i ran into mike hodgson from pitch black this week at the point chev countdown and he says that paid downloads have really started to work for them ingrooves the san francisco based aggregator they use outside new zealand gets them a direct link off the electronic genre page on every itunes country store they now release digital singles regularly via this route and in the last six months pitch black sold 18 600 individual tracks online in about 55 countries from belgium to brazil latvia to luxembourg mike says allowing the tracks onto subscriber music services which return quite a low rate has been a surprise boon im guessing it probably doesnt amount to much more than 10 000 net per six months but its passive income that doubles as marketing in multiple territories mikes pretty happy with how its going the top artists on amplifier are now billing five figure sums too and increasingly they dont have conventional record deals interesting

6617789 kita harus memastikan apbn yang semakin besar ini tidak diikuti dengan semakin meningkatnya penyimpangan mismanagement apalagi korupsi di daerah apbn dan apbd adalah uang rakyat yang harus dimanfaatkan sebesar besarnya untuk kepentingan dan kesejahteraan rakyat oleh karena itu saya ingin menegaskan sekali lagi tidak ada toleransi bagi kejahatan korupsi
6617790 marilah kita mengemban amanah dan tanggungjawab dengan baik sehingga kita meninggalkan nama yang baik pula yaitu nama yang akan dikenang oleh rakyat jauh setelah kita meninggalkan jabatan yang kita emban
6617791 daerahlah yang berada paling depan untuk peningkatan kemakmuran rakyat oleh karena itu anggaran yang semakin besar di daerah selayaknya diikuti oleh kompetensi dan tanggung jawab penuh untuk mengelola secara baik dan transparan bagi kemakmuran dan kesejahteraan rakyat

6617799 pemerintah harus fokus pada pembinaan generasi muda yang bakal masuk ke pasar kerja sejak mereka masih sekolah mereka sangat berpotensi dan mampu menyerap berbagai hal yang bisa meningkatkan kompetensi dan keahliannya sesuai kebutuhan pasar kerja
6617800 minimnya kompetensi dan keahlian lulusan sekolah formal terlihat dalam bursa bursa kerja yang semakin sering diselenggarakan sejak tahun 2006 meskipun peminat setiap bursa membeludak hampir 30 persen lowongan kerja yang tersedia tidak terisi karena pelamar tidak memenuhi kriteria pemberi kerja artinya lapangan kerja tersedia kompetensi peminat tak memenuhi persyaratan yang diminta
6617801 tahun 2008 setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan ekonomi menambah 702 000 tenaga kerja tetapi ada tren semakin besar yang masuk ke sektor informal padahal yang dibutuhkan adalah penyerapan tenaga kerja pada sektor formal
6617802 jika asumsi itu dipakai pula pada penambahan tenaga kerja baru artinya dari 702 000 tenaga kerja baru yang bertambah setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan hanya sekitar 210 000 tenaga kerja yang masuk ke sektor formal

6617814 ada dua hal yang diminta adanya sampel dna bisa diambil di indonesia atau mengirim keluarga terdekat dalam hal ini ibu kandungnya ke madrid informasi yang didapatkan kbri di spanyol spanair akan menanggung biaya transportasi dan akomodasi dari indonesia ke spanyol di sisi lain deplu menyiapkan dokumen dokumen penunjang seperti pengajuan visa melalui kedutaan spanyol di indonesia karena info yang kami dapat dari paman korban katanya ibu nguni belum punya paspor

6617816 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control

6617916 the president of the united states would be liable to be impeached tried and upon conviction removed from office and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law
6617917 the president will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the union the power of the british king extends to the
6617918 the president is to have power with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur
6617919 the president can prescribe no rules concerning the commerce or currency of the nation the king is in several respects the arbiter of commerce and in this capacity can establish markets and fairs can regulate weights and measures can lay embargoes for a limited time can coin money what answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other
6617920 the president is the executor of the laws but he does not really co operate in making them since the refusal of his assent does not prevent their passage he is not therefore a part of the sovereign power but only its agent the president is placed beside the legislature like an inferior and dependent power
6617921 temporary limited and subordinate w hen he is at the head of government he has but little power little wealth and little glory to share among his friends and his influence in the state is too small for the success or the ruin of a faction to depend up his elevation to power the influence which the president exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and indirect
6617922 without leadership or without the intimate almost instinctive coordination of the organs of life and action we have grown more and more from generation to generation to look to the president as the unifying force in our complex system to do so is not inconsistent with the actual provisions of the constitution it is only inconsistent with a very mechanical theory of its meaning and intention
6617923 man who understands his own day and the needs of the country and who has the personality and the initiative to enforce his views both upon the people and upon congress he is not so much part of its organization as its vital link of connection with the thinking nation he is also the political leader of the nation the nation as a whole has chosen him let him once win the admiration and confidence of the country and no other single force can withstand him no combination of forces will easily overpower him his position takes the imagination of the country he is the representative of no constituency but of the whole people the country never feels the zest of action so much as when its president is of such insight and caliber its instinct is for unified action and it craves a single leader

6617977 benar kau rupanya masih ingat orang she ouw itu mengapa kau tidak bicara terus sungguh mengenaskan matinya nona ouw apakah di dalam hatimu kau tidak pernah merasa malu
6617978 ya bilang ya tidak bilang tidak mengapa kau tak berani buka suara bukankah tiap kok ie sian ouw ceng goe sinshe binasa dalam tanganmu benarkah begitu jawab
6617979 menurut kebiasaan orang orang rimba persilatan membalas budi dengan budi kejahatan dengan kejahatan tiap kok ie sian anggota beng kauw kau adalah seorang yang berhutang budi terhadap beng kauw tapi lihatlah hari ini kau mengajak orang orang partaimu untuk menyerang beng kauw orang menolong jiwamu kau berbalik mencelakai adik orang itu manusia rendah kau lebih rendah dari pada binatang mukamu tebal begitu punya tebal hingga kau masih ada muka untuk menjadi ciang bun jin dari sebuah partai besar
6617980 kalau ouw shinshe masih hidup dan berada di sini ia pasti akan merasa puas
6617981 sekarang cukuplah hari ini aku mengampuni jiwanya biarlah dilain hari aku berhitungan lagi dengan dia
6617982 binatang hari ini aku menitipkan kepalamu di atas lehermu untuk sementara waktu
6617983 sekarang kau boleh belajar kenal dengan lihainya eng coa seng sie pek
6617984 hwa san pay menamakan diri sebagai partai yang lurus bersih siapa nyana pmemimpin partai itu memiliki ilmu penyebar racun
6617985 tak seorangpun akan menduga bahwa dalam kipas yang seindah ini bersembunyi alat rahasia untuk melepaskan racun yang hebat
6617986 tapi sebelum tahu racun apa yang digunakan olehmu aku tidak berdaya
6617987 racun racun kim cam kouw tok aduh bunuhlah aku lekas
6617988 kau melepaskan racun itu kepadaku tapi aku berhasil menolaknya dengan menggunakan lweekang dan lalu balas menghantam kau
6617989 menolong aku akan menolong tapi dia harus lebih dahulu mengakui segala kedosaannya
6617990 aku tahu cara mengobati orang yang kena racun kim cam kouw tok tapi sebelum ditolong kau harus menjawab sejujurnya setiap pertanyaanku jika kau berdusta aku takkan memperdulikan kau lagi kau akan menderita tujuh hari tujuh malam sehingga dagingmu rusak dan tulang tulangmu kelihatan
6617991 dahulu ong lan kouw pernah mengatakan dagingku akan rusak dan tulang tulangku kelihatan sesudah aku menderita tujuh hari tujuh malam
6617992 aku akan membuat lubang di sini dan akan memasukkan obat ke dalam lobang
6617993 orang hwa san pay boleh dibunuh tidak boleh dihina perbuatanmu terhadap ciang bun jin kami bukan perbuatan seorang gagah
6617994 bolehkah aku mendapat tahu she dan nama besar kedua cianpwee
6617995 badannya penuh racun dan kalau kena sedikit saja kau akan menderita seperti dia
6617996 sesudah mencelakai kau jalan satu satunya untukku adalah menumplak kedosaan di atas pundak beng kauw
6617997 para cianpwee dari hwa san pay dengarlah pek goan suhu bukan dicekali oleh orang beng kauw kalau sudah salah mereka orang
6617998 perkataan yang sudah diucapkan tidak bisa diabaikan dengan begitu saja urusan dalam partai bisa dibereskan sesudah kalian pulang ke hwa san
6617999 bahwa kau sudah membikin terang satu perkara besar dalam partai kami sehingga sakit hatinya pek goan soetit bisa terbalas aku merasa sangat berterima kasih
6618000 tapi sebab kau sudah merusak nama harumnya hwa san pay maka tak ada jalan lain bagi kami berdua daripada mengadu jiwa dengan kau
6618001 yang bersih tetap bersih yang kotor tinggal kotor kalau dalam sebuah partai muncul seorang jahat nama partai tersebut tidak rusak karena adanya orang jahat itu mengapa kalian berpandangan begitu sempit
6618002 bagaimana pendapatmu apakah kejadian itu tidak menodai nama hwa san pay
6618003 lebih dahulu singkirkan hinaan dari luar kemudian barulah menyapu bersih pintu kita kalau hari ini hwa san pay tidak berhasil menjatuhkan bocah itu kita tidak bisa berdiri lagi dalam rimba persilatan
6618004 eh bocah kami berdua mau mengerubuti kau jika kau rasa tidak cukup adil paling benar siang siang kau mengaku kalah
6618005 kalau kami mengerubuti kau kau pasti tak bisa hidup lagi
6618006 kami berdua mempunyai ilmu golok yang dinamakan liang gie to hoat kau pasti kalah aku harap kau tidak menyesal
6618007 begitu bertempur golok kami tak mau main sungkan sungkan lagi kulihat kau seorang yang baik aku tidak sampai hati jika pasti membacok kau
6618008 benda yang begini beracun tidak boleh dibiarkan lama lama di dunia
6618009 kau boleh menggunakan senjata apapun jua perlu apa kau tanya aku
6618010 bocah kau memiliki ilmu silat yang sangat tinggi dan kau tentu mahir dalam delapan belas senjata
6618011 tapi sangat keterlaluan jika kau meladeni kami berdua dengan tangan kosong
6618012 aku bersedia untuk mengalah terhadapmu dan kau boleh menggunakan senjata yang sangat berat itu
6618013 senjata itu agak luar biasa loocianpwee kelihatannya ingin menjajal kepandaianku
6618014 jie wie loo cianpwee jangan bingung boanpwee hanya main main
6618015 tapi kita harus menggunakan satu cara baru kalau kau menang karena tenagamu yang besar biarpun kalah kami kalah dengan penasaran bukankah demikian
6618016 malu benar benar malu kakek jenggotan yang main padan berbalik mengatakan orang lain curang
6618017 orang sering kata yang rugi ialah yang untung garam yang ditelan olehku lebih banyak daripada beras yang ditelan olehmu jembatan yang dilewati olehku lebih panjang daripada jalanan yang pernah dilalui olehmu bocah tahu apa kau
6618018 kalau kau tidak setuju kita boleh tidak usah bertanding lagi dalam pertandingan tadi kau tak kalah dan kamipun tak menang seri saja tigapuluh tahun kemudian kita boleh berjumpa kembali
6618019 orang she can kami mengaku kalah kau boleh berbuat sesuka hati terhadap kami
6618020 dengan memberanikan hati boanpwee hanya ingin mendamaikan permusuhan antara partai cianpwee dengan beng kauw
6618021 ilmu golok yang terlihai dari hwa san pay dinamakan hoan liang gie to hoat
6618022 lihainya to hoat itu sudah dirasai olehmu tapi kau tak tahu bahwa koen loen pay mempunyai ilmu pedang yang dinamakan ceng liang gie kiam hoat kelihaian ilmu ini dikatakan berendeng dengan to hoat dari hwa san pay masing masing mempunyai keunggulan sendiri sendiri manakala dua golok dan dua pedang dipersatukan menjadi satu maka im negatip akan mendapat imbangan dari yang positip dan air akan membantu api hai
6618023 apakah cianpwee dari koen loen pay sudi memberi pelajaran kepadaku
6618024 dalam koen loen pay kecuali thie khim sian seng suami isteri tak ada lain orang yang bisa bekerja sama dengan kami berdua
6618025 ku tak tahu apakah ho ciang boen bernyali cukup besar atau tidak
6618026 oooh suami isteri ho dari koen loen pay tidak berani bertempur dengan kau kau tak usah heran biarpun boleh juga ceng liang gie kam hoat masih banyak cacatnya dibandingkan dengan ilmu golok kami hoan liang gie to hoat masih lebih unggul setingkat dua tingkat
6618027 kita berempat coba main main dengan bocah itu supaya dia mengenal lihainya ilmu silat hwa san dan koen loen
6618028 can siauw hiap telah mendapat kemajuan pesat sekali dengan jalan ini aku memberi selamat aku ingin minta pengajaranmu
6618029 sudah lama kudengar kiam hoat kalian berdua yang sangat lihai
6618030 hari itu kau menghajar aku sepuas hati hari ini meskipun tidak mengambil jiwamu aku akan memberi pelajaran setimpal kepadamu
6618031 biarlah dengan menggunakan ini boanpwee menerima pelajaran dari hwa san koen loen
6618032 bocah kau sedikitpun tidak memandang sebelah mata kepada ilmu silat hwa san dan koen loen
6618033 boanpwee pernah dengar cerita seorang sian hoe mendiang ayah bahwa seorang cianpwee dari koen loen pay yaitu ho ciok to sian seng mempunyai kepandaian luar biasa dalam ilmu memetik khim bersilat dengan pedang dan main catur sehingga beliau dikenal sebagai koen loen sam seng hanya sayang kita terlahir terlalu lambat dan tak mendapat kesempatan untuk bertemu dengan orang tua itu
6618034 anak haram betapa tingginya kepandaianmu sehingga kau begitu kurang ajar terhadap guruku
6618035 beberapa tahun yang lalu nona kecil itu sudah pernah ditutup jalan darahnya dan mereka dipaksa untuk minum arak beracun sedang aku sendiri tidak berdaya untuk membuka hiat to yang tertotok
6618036 boe kie boe kie kau terlalu memandang enteng kepada orang gagah di kolong langit sekarang kau menghadapi bencana jika bisa keluar dengan selamat kau harus ingat baik baik pelajaran yang pahit ini benar juga kata orang di luar langit masih ada langit di atas manusia masih ada manusia
6618037 kalau kau tidak mau turun tangan terhadap orangmu biarlah aku yang turun tangan
6618038 kalau bisa hidup terus aku pasti akan berhitungan dengan bangsat kate dan jangkung itu
6618039 tapi sangat tidak pantas kalau aku menyeret juga imam ini
6618040 ilmu silat pemuda itu sangat luar biasa tapi keempat pemimpin dari koen loen pay dan hwa san pay sudah menjepitnya sehingga ia tidak bisa bergerak lagi ilmu silat dari tiong goan tak akan bisa ditandingi oleh segalma ilmu siluman dari see hek liang gie berubah menjadi soe siang dan soe siang berubah menjadi pat kwa dalam ilmu silat itu terdapat 8 kali delapan 64 kie pian perubahan yang luar biasa dan kali empat puluh empat teng pian perubahan yang sudah tetap enam puluh empat dikali dengan enam puluh empat sehingga sama sekali ada empat ribu sembilan puluh enam perubahan di antara macam macam ilmu silat di kolong langit ilmu silat liang gie lah yang mempunyai banyak perubahan
6618041 soe hoe menurut pendapat teecoe biarpun jurus juruanya sangat beraneka warna intisari dari cong han siang gie ialah thay kek menjadi im yang liang gie yang terdiri dair thay yang dan siauw im inilah yang dinamakan siauw yang dan thay im inilah yang dinamakan soe sian kalau tidak salah meskipun pukulan pukulan keempat cianpwee itu hebat luar biasa tetapi yang paling lihai adalah po hoatnya tindakannya
6618042 aku merasa girang bahwa kau bisa menangkap intisari dari ilmu silat para cianpwee
6618043 despite the number it was a really good race for me i was really happy i raced a good race the way i was out on the water im happy about my performance today
6618044 i knew what i had to do and in the end i did it i gave everything i had out there and i finished the race exhausted more tired than i was when i finished the 1 000 i did not hold back at all
6618045 im very happy that i got three chances to do this and that it didnt happen all on just one day it happened over three days
6618046 unlike the beginning i was prepared mentally this last race was as comfortable as if i was sleeping at home
6618047 weve still got a lot of administrative work to do our main goal for coming out here was to develop the program on guam we want to start producing kids that are interested in the sport let them know what its all about and let them see that its ok to dream the sooner the better

6618053 practicing gratitude helps people extract the most out of life
6618054 people can also experience an overall shift to a more benevolent view of the world i think its kind of a spiritual shift for some people because it makes them more aware of life as a gift
6618055 we ask people to focus every day on a particular person who provided them with a benefit
6618056 naikan gratitude grace and the japanese art of self reflection
6618057 what have i received today what have i given what trouble have i caused
6618058 when i list everything i received and then everything i gave each day what i have in the giving column is always so much shorter than whats in the receiving column
6618059 as we become aware that weve received so much more than weve given not only does that cultivate gratitude it also cultivates often a sense of wanting to give something back to the world
6618060 one of the mistakes people often make in our culture is thinking you have to feel grateful to practice gratitude
6618061 you can practice anytime when you feel sorrow great anxiety over a parents imminent death if you have a disabled child
6618062 on the first day of spring i was raking the gravel off the grass it was hard and i was starting to complain to myself
6618063 when i caught myself thinking i switched over to thank you
6618064 in our family every evening when we have dinner we say our thank yous
6618065 its not a formal prayer of any kind but just what were grateful for in the moment and thats all

6618078 being thoroughly disgusted with maid rpg then being unable to get it out of my head or dreams all weekend
6618079 i think id rather not be exposed to that thanks
6618080 but my favorite pick of the con so far is the maid rpg the first japanese tabletop rpg to be translated into english in which you play anime maids competing to gain the masters favor all the while sabotaging each other and dealing with bizarro random events abso fricking lutely hilarious this is a comedy game that perfectly captures anime tropes in fact i defy anyone to play this game and not produce a perfect anime story tons of fun playable with no prep a joy to read i laughed out loud just about every page and just well done all around
6618081 its a japanese game and you play maids in it yeah totally not for everybody but as i read through the book last night i couldnt go a couple of pages without coming across some idea for a game that i wanted to run
6618082 dont act like you dont want to be the little girl
6618083 of course wed all download the pdf instead of paying for it despite your friends efforts

6618090 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6618091 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6618092 baracks response should be yes i made four million dollars last year by that measure im a millionaire which is something i dont think my wife and kids or anyone elses would complain that much about lets be honest here im a millionaire and so is john mccain but heres the difference between us john mccain wants to help todays millionaires become tomorrows billionaires im a millionaire who wants to help todays non millionaires to have a chance to get rich too john mccain is about the millionaires dream im about the american middle class american dream john mccain supports the so called bush tax cut which is actually a tax shift pushing the cost of government from the broad shoulders of the rich to the overburdened shoulders of the middle class to help keep making millionaires billionaires john mccain supports off shore oil leasing not drilling mind you but leasing oil sites offshore to mega oil companies who already own thousands of acres of oil leases they refuse to drill on to help make more millionaires billionaires john mccain tells you off shore leasing will bring down prices at the pump with all due respect the good senator is at least on this issue either misinformed himself or deliberately trying to misinform you the people all the rhetoric about off shore drilling is a shell game by the very companies that helped bring you high gas prices to allow them to lock up total control of all future oil supplies in this country which will help make a few billionaires mega billionaires but wont do one thing for your pocketbook the next time you gas up so do i want to get in to a debate about houses the answer is no i dont

6618306 origins directors simply assert that bg groups all cash offer undervalues the company but there is no evidence or independent experts report to support this view nor is there any forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision further origin has failed to demonstrate any confidence that the coal seam gas monetisation process will yield superior value for its shareholders
6618307 whilst equity markets and energy prices decline and coal seam gas companies share prices fall origin is telling its shareholders to wait for an uncertain and unclear outcome from its monetisation process and reject the certain value of bg groups a 15 50 all cash offer
6618308 even though shareholders are being told to wait they are not materially better informed the information in the targets statement on important issues such as reversionary rights reserves and development plans is incomplete inconsistent and confusing origin has today confirmed that further information on these matters is being shared with prospective joint venture partners but still chooses to withhold this information from its shareholders
6618309 origin argues that its current market price and brokers price targets justify a decision to reject our offer however these are completely inadequate responses to an all cash offer which provides a 72 premium origin also fails to acknowledge that its share price is fundamentally supported by bg groups offer furthermore the targets statement fails to note that other australian coal seam gas companies which have announced joint ventures have seen their share prices fall materially from post announcement levels
6618310 origin has disclosed virtually no information about the risks for shareholders if they reject bg groups offer and retain their shares the targets statement provides scant detail on the companys development plans is silent on the capital requirements and fails to specify the considerable risks inherent in the as yet undefined alternative furthermore origin has acknowledged that it lacks the necessary liquefied natural gas lng development marketing and operating skills
6618311 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders

6618317 this was the first statuette from this period that had such detailed features and it was also the first statuette to be discovered at the time on an archeological site
6618318 this statue is really remarkable and when you look at the way she was carved the way the muscles and different parts of the body are rendered you can tell the sculptor used a model
6618319 resulted from perfect observation of the human body but she was also arranged to make her curves more harmonious
6618320 i think a lot of visitors come to the museum just to see the venus
6618321 shes a rather older woman one who has certainly already had children
6618322 moreover we cant prove that women played a predominant role during this period and that these female statuettes honoured them there are many other statuettes from that period representing animals part humans and part animals or assexual human beings
6618323 they could have been expressions of a single belief that spread through europe
6618324 from that point of view either the venus was brought here or the rock fragments disappeared when a railroad was built there in the 19th century
6618325 some believe the female owners of the insignias used them to place their seal on valuable documents others believe the owners may have used the seal to indicate their lofty status in society

6618372 and ideologically theyre not far apart its more of a personality difference whoever he cant woo she can woo we need them both
6618373 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6618374 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6618375 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6618376 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6618377 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6618378 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6618379 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6618380 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6618381 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at harvard law school obama did not take it but over the years the two men stayed in touch
6618382 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6618383 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6618384 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6618385 i didnt think i could do organic before im such a stickler for symmetry

6618414 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6618415 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6618416 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6618417 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6618418 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6618419 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6618420 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6618421 these days there are fewer jobs due to stricter building regulations and the rising cost of materials
6618422 there have always been peaks and troughs in the construction industry but the peaks are much lower than they used to be and the troughs much deeper
6618423 we are trying to create a sense of community here its not all bad news

6618426 ive never had a pair of shoes worth more than 1 000 yen
6618427 some people are working out of town but a lot have decided to sleep rough tonight
6618428 we dont allow any alcohol here so on a hot evening like this they prefer to drink outside and sleep in the park
6618429 we have a freedom that other japanese dont have we get three meals a day and its easy to make friends ive made lots of friends here over the years and ive seen lots of them die

6618444 it was the worst ive ever seen in a picture from the modern era
6618445 its a tough golf course i thought if you shoot in the red all week in the 60s all week youll have something at the end there
6618446 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6618447 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6618448 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6618449 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6618450 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6618451 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6618452 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6618453 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6618454 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6618455 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6618456 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding
6618457 mccain staffers reported that they had received an envelope containing white powder in mccains campaign office in centennial
6618458 the staff has been quarantined and the building has been evacuated
6618459 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6618460 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6618461 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6618462 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6618463 a call of a suspicious package containing an unknown powder that was delivered
6618464 at this time the scene has been secured and several people who may have been exposed to the substance are being examined by medical personnel
6618465 the substance is being examined to determine if it is hazardous
6618466 a couple of people said he was pulling the dog by its ears and head butting the animal

6618473 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years

6618476 children have held up well under the circumstances and have not been susceptible to manipulation by the jugendamt or other children in the homes this is a real testimony of the strength of the family and the parents
6618477 they so appreciate the letters from american homeschoolers some days we are quite depressed about the situation in germany and then we go to the mailbox and we read a wonderful note of encouragement from an american homeschooling family our children love the letters and have already several pen pals
6618478 we are educating our children well they are well adjusted and not deprived in anyway we have again applied for status of a private school in hesse we are willing to work with the authorities to come to an understanding how we can educate our children but we will not compromise on whether we as their parents will educate them it is our duty and responsibility and our conscience will not allow us to give that up
6618479 families should not have to choose between their homeland and homeschooling
6618480 these families are following their conscience and germany is simply out of step to treat parents who choose to educate their own children in this dramatically autocratic way this kind of behavior by the federal republic of germany is very disturbing hslda is committed to helping persecuted homeschoolers in germany and calls on state legislators in germany to take action to change their laws to make homeschooling legal homeschooling works and is legal all over europe germany should not be allowed to get away with this kind of repression of a fundamental human right
6618481 is it a phone or is it a camera only a few years ago the features would have been unimaginable on anything but a high spec camera

6618483 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us
6618484 the west saved the capital they were moving to tbilisi there was one night that was very dangerous the russian tanks were very close to the capital i dont know what happened but they moved the tanks back
6618485 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
6618486 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
6618487 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewelers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms

6618695 tengo una carta ah y espero que el tramite me de para que ludue a juegue muchos minutos el se ha adelantado mucho en el proceso de recuperaci n y est bien quiero motivarlo para que juegue ya sea algunos 15 20 minutos o media hora esto depende de las circunstancias del partido y si no se dan me esperar a que agarre m s fuerza y poderlo utilizar contra tecos
6618696 se trata de un equipo muy joven y que tiene mucha din mica juegue quien juegue da buenos juegos suele haber partidos interesantes entre santos y chivas y vamos a intentar quitar esa racha negativa que indica que hace diez a os no le gana santos en el jalisco
6618697 tenemos que mejorar algo pero obviamente ya llevamos dos partidos con el cero atr s y es muy dif cil en nuestro torneo que un equipo mantenga eso tenemos que tener m s concentraci n y orden para que no nos vuelva a pasar lo que pas con indios pero vamos a mejorar contra chivas
6618698 estoy contento por volver viv siete a os y medio muy importantes de mi vida futbol stica pero tambi n estoy muy contento por estar ac en torre n
6618699 siempre empezar cualquier eliminatoria ganando es importante jugamos bien y sacamos un buen resultado
6618700 est complicad sima yo que soy un tipo al que le ha tocado la fortuna de jugar las ltimas tres s que es muy complicado la gente que crea que es f cil se equivoca todos son dif ciles y a m xico se le juega siempre a muerte no te dan espacios y no te dejan jugar si por ah se encuentran un gol como honduras suele complicarse m s pero estamos mentalizados y preparados para esto
6618701 creo que la conjunci n y experiencia era la ideal
6618702 creo que fue un triunfo merecido que se complic poco m s de lo pensado porque de inicio iba ganando honduras pero se ve a que era cuesti n de que cayera un gol en el primer tiempo hubo bastantes llegadas
6618703 creo que la conjunci n y experiencia era la ideal a lo mejor se puede llegar m s en ataque que en defensa con la juventud porque se pueden errar goles pero mientras no te hagan gol son jugadores que a pesar de no son grandes de edad tiene experiencia de jugar en otros pa ses entonces era una buena opci n
6618704 no s como se presentar n los dem s partidos pero todos los rivales son complicados pero en el futbol hay l gica las cosas pueden cambiar tanto jamaica como canad pueden hacer un partido complicado a m xico siempre y cuando no metan r pido un gol porque cuando es al rev s el partido ya se acaba
6618705 la verdad es que de eso no me gustar a hablar pero estoy en contra de eso naturalizados s que hay que apoyar a la selecci n y cuando hay un jugador extranjero que hace diferencia hay que aplaudirlo
6618706 pero cuando hay un jugador que en su posici n hay diez en el futbol mexicano creo que no hay necesidad de llevar a un jugador as pienso que pueden estar luis p rez fernando arce jaime correa y creo que ayer no se dio esa diferencia para nada
6618707 creo que el primer tiempo no fue el adecuado pero con los ajustes del segundo tiempo la entrada de cuauht moc el equipo se vio diferente fue una actuaci n a medias del equipo mexicano pues pienso que en el estadio azteca se debieron hacer mejor las cosas
6618708 es como en un equipo cuando viene un extranjero tiene que marcar diferencia sino me quedo con los jugadores que hay en el club y con la gente que viene de fuerzas b sicas entonces un extranjero debe marcar diferencia sino para qu lo traen
6618709 futbol sticamente s necaxa es regular a lo mejor en puntos no se refleja tanto pero es un equipo muy complicado muy ordenado y que pocas veces cede espacios y aqu como locales tenemos que hacer valer esta condici n
6618710 nosotros tenemos que partir del orden tambi n buscar variantes porque creo hay equipo para hacerlo hay jugadores que juegan bien por las bandas de parte nuestra jugadores r pidos jugadores que en pelota parada pueden marcar diferencia adem s tenemos un desdoble muy r pido as que hay que buscar por todos los medios y buscar pronto abrir el marcador
6618711 espero pueda volverme a ganar la confianza del t cnico
6618712 en esos pocos minutos que jugu me sent muy acoplado al equipo espero que con el transcurrir de los encuentros y en los entrenamientos pueda volverme a ganar la confianza del t cnico y la titularidad
6618713 fue un triunfo de mucha satisfacci n el equipo hab a hecho el esfuerzo en todos los encuentros y ahora se sacaron los tres puntos de locales hay que seguir as en casa
6618714 tenemos que hacer sentir que esta cancha le pese al rival y sumar los puntos necesarios para lograr la clasificaci n a la liguilla
6618715 estos torneos te sirven de mucho creo que este tipo de participaci n a nivel interncional sirve para darnos cuenta que no es cosa de otro planeta jugar en europa obviamente es un futbol muy din mico muy agresivo y vertical pero en cuanto a t cnica y capacidad del futbolista espa ol el de cruz azul est a la altura
6618716 todos tenemos ese sue o pero lo primero es ser profesionales aqu regresamos con mucha confianza nos dej muchas ense anzas jugar all sabemos que son oportunidades que no se ven tan seguido y regresas con toda la ilusi n de plasmarlo en el duelo ante monterrey
6618717 monterrey lleva una base desde hace tiempo y que tiene refuerzos muy buenos adem s est muy bien dirigido y siguen siendo una inc gnita ya que ltimamente los equipos del norte cambian mucho cuando juegan de local o lo hacen como visitante triangulan muy bien buscan la porter a totalmente el estilo de la volpe y vendr n a ganarnos despu s de perder con tecos
6618718 cada vez que est s en un equipo y no juegas es molesto porque uno siempre tiene que jugar el entrenador y su cuerpo t cnico toman decisones y las respeto uno va a la selecci n sabiendo que puede pasar eso y sucedi me toc apoyar desde la banca con buena vibra para que m xico ganara yo siempre me visualiazo jugando todos los partidos y m s en la selecci n y m s en partidos de eliminatoria pero ramos 25 y cualquiera pod a ser titular obviamente a todos los que no jugamos nos molest pero as es esto el grupo gan y es lo m s valioso
6618719 nadie te garantiza que vas a jugar se busca terminar bien sabiendo que entrenaste bien que te encuentras en buen nivel y que puedes responder en cualquier momento no s haya experimentado o no con la alineaci n l sali con la idea de sacar los tres puntos y para ello se trabaj y se consigui el resultado iniciar la eliminatora con el pie derecho es muy importante para tomar confianza y soltura
6618720 todos hay que meternos de lleno ya en el partido del s bado con los rayados es un rival complicado y bien entrenado con un sistema de juego complicado estamos en casa y esperamos sacar un buen resultado los equipos de ricardo son muy ordenados y peligrosos hay que saber contrarrestarlos en la cancha
6618721 creo que estamos bien si bien es cierto que no nos gusta estar en esta situaci n con apenas dos puntos tratamos de estar lo mejor posible y trabajar con buen ambiente y buen nimo para tratar de salir de la mala racha
6618722 vamos a jugar a las 12 del d a con calor en cancha grande ante un buen equipo que es apoyado por su p blico pero trataremos de hacer bien las cosas y ojal podamos sacar el resultado y de ah para adelante empezar a jugar bien
6618723 cacho es un jugador con cualidades y que define muy bien hay que estar atentos y muy cerca de l para que no nos haga gol
6618724 the core values of the netherlands constitutional state are the basis for identification with the netherlands
6618725 the government should work for a society that encourages participation it is however the responsibility of every citizen to actually participate and show themselves to be involved in the netherlands society
6618726 identity that excludes no people and that leaves room for people to be able to identify with the netherlands in their own specific way
6618727 cannot and will not prescribe what dutch nationality means for people and in what way people identify with the netherlands
6618728 a second task lies in the area of binding via citizenship
6618729 active participation in dutch society is a task for all citizens

6618755 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6618756 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6618757 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6618758 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6618759 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
6618760 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago

6618765 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6618766 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6618767 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6618768 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6618769 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6618770 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6618771 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6618772 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6618773 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6618774 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6618775 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6618776 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6618777 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away

6618780 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6618781 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6618782 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6618783 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6618784 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6618785 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6618786 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

6618788 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6618789 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6618790 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6618791 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6618792 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6618793 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6618794 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6618795 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6618796 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6618797 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6618798 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6618799 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6618800 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6618801 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6618802 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6618803 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6618804 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6618805 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6618806 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6618807 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6618808 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6618818 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6618819 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment
6618820 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6618821 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6618822 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6618823 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6618824 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6618825 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6618826 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6618827 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6618828 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6618829 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6618830 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6618831 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6618832 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6618833 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6618834 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6618835 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6618836 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6618837 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6618838 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6618839 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6618840 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6618841 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6618842 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6618843 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6618844 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6618845 this is a planning took where all things are going
6618846 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6618847 i guess i would call them a favorite i like the coaching staff and i love the campus i could feel at home there
6618848 one of the areas that we are particularly interested in is the connection between disruption of normal sleep patterns and its impact on bipolar disorder in relation to progression and treatment of the disorder
6618849 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6618850 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6618851 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6618852 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6618853 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6618854 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6618855 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6618856 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6618857 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6618858 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6618859 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6618866 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

6618891 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6618892 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6618893 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6618910 set the tent ablaze in a failed attempt to cover up her crimes against herself
6618911 lavena johnson was raped beaten and murdered by someone on a military base in balad iraq and the army doesnt want you to know about it army officers most especially didnt want her parents to know about it so they concocted the suicide story informing them that their daughter had shot herself in the head in her barracks
6618912 they said my daughter shot herself in the head shes right handed and the bullet hole was on the left side of her head
6618913 horrific photographs from the autopsy that clearly showed the extent of their daughters injuries
6618914 it proved that the original black and white photos of lavenas body originally sent to them had been doctored also on the disk were damning sketches of the crime scene that gave her parents further information contradicting the armys statements
6618915 but im finding out that very few people do as compared to jamie leigh jones theres a couple of big differences as to why one womans story is virtually unknown while the other was covered by brian ross and abc news jamie leigh jones is white shes alive to tell her tale lavena johnson is black shes been dead now for over three years

6618959 yes hes a herald and no we arent servants of god at least the way you are thinking but he wasnt always like this at one time he was good well as good as a herald can be and my mother truly loved him but he went completely insane and were not certain why with his insanity he declared war on everything and my brother and i stood up to him just for my brother to literally stab me in the back i had to kill my brother and wounded my father

6618968 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6618969 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges

6619001 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6619002 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6619003 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6619004 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6619005 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6619006 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6619007 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6619008 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6619009 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6619010 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6619011 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6619012 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6619013 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6619014 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6619015 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6619016 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6619017 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6619018 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6619019 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6619020 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6619021 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6619022 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6619023 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6619024 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6619025 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6619026 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6619027 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6619028 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6619029 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6619030 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6619031 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6619032 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6619033 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6619034 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6619035 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6619036 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6619037 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6619038 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6619039 v ouvir seus 4 primeiros lbuns e aprenda com o seu antigo eu
6619040 if i could have my wasted days back would i use them to get back on track
6619041 well i havent heard of this before but youre a down to earth enough person that i believe you so lets take it out
6619042 dude get your ass to huntsville asap ive called a meeting for 9am
6619043 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6619044 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6619045 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6619046 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6619047 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6619048 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6619049 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6619050 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6619051 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6619052 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6619053 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6619054 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6619055 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6619056 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6619057 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6619058 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6619059 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6619060 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6619061 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6619062 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6619063 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6619064 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6619065 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6619066 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6619067 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6619068 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6619069 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6619070 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6619071 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6619072 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6619073 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6619074 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6619075 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6619076 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6619077 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6619078 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6619079 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6619080 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6619081 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6619082 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6619083 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6619084 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6619085 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6619086 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6619087 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6619088 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6619089 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6619090 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6619091 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6619092 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6619093 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6619094 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6619095 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
6619096 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
6619097 look the clintons are dirty how many times do the republicans need to throw that in our faces turn the page they did most of the stuff that the republicans said they did whitewater catte futures filegate travelgate gennifer flowers katherina wilkie monica lewinsky turn the page
6619098 never walk over others in climbing the ladder to success you just might meet them on your way down
6619099 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6619100 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6619101 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6619102 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6619103 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6619104 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6619105 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6619106 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6619107 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6619108 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6619109 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6619110 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6619111 tiket bas abis apa petang x der kak aduh hai emm x per la kak terima kasih ya
6619112 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6619113 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6619114 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6619115 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6619116 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6619117 its a crime of impulse a crime by people who lack control
6619118 putting small children in front of them its a bad idea
6619119 im not going to make it oh yeah i can
6619120 im fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run poland
6619121 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6619122 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6619123 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6619124 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6619125 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6619126 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6619127 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6619128 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6619129 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6619130 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6619131 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting
6619132 make the number cell x wide and make the text cell y wide
6619133 this knowledgeable crowd showed the kind of independence weve come to expect from linux users
6619134 linuxworld attendees may seem like a tough crowd for vendors to please but they are quite willing to compliment a vendor they feel is doing a good job
6619135 well theres such a small amount in there it wont make a difference
6619136 any of the 56 cosmetic ingredients that include the clauses peg xynol ceteareth and oleth
6619137 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6619138 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6619139 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6619140 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6619141 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6619142 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6619143 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6619144 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6619145 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6619146 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6619147 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6619148 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6619149 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6619150 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6619151 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6619152 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6619153 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6619154 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6619155 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6619156 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6619157 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6619158 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6619159 the crazy thing is that singing was the first thing and modeling just happened to take off
6619160 the second day after i got out i recorded my first song ever and now we are here
6619161 i never got dropped i requested a release from dtp and luda and chaka granted it to me
6619162 i just felt that the mr ordinary project would be better at a different home with somebody who understood like fully understood my quirkiness
6619163 theyre my family you know and i still have mad love for them i still talk to chaka
6619164 ive just been working in the studio and ive been cranking out a couple of cool songs lately i just want to write and i want to share my thoughts and melodies with other people
6619165 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6619166 i always thought id be able to cover the money
6619167 i will do everything in my power to repay santa pal as soon as possible
6619168 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6619169 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6619170 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6619171 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6619172 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6619173 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6619174 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6619175 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6619176 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

6619179 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6619180 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6619181 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6619182 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6619183 and we dont have a lot of time to be building things
6619184 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6619185 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6619186 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6619187 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6619188 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6619189 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6619190 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6619191 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6619192 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6619193 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6619194 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6619195 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6619196 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6619197 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6619198 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6619199 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6619200 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6619201 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6619202 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6619203 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6619204 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6619205 enhance national security protect human rights and strongly support personal liberty measures design to strengthen democracy respect for the laws of economics
6619206 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6619207 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
6619208 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6619209 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
6619210 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton

6619225 indonesia should take the next steps and suspend him from any command and then hand him over for trial for the crimes he committed in east timor
6619226 unfortunately the transfer of col siagian has not ended the repression in west papua a little over a week ago opius tabuni was shot and killed by indonesian security forces during a celebration world indigenous peoples day in wamena
6619227 prisoners of conscience like filep karma and yusak pakage continue to serve outrageously long prison terms for engaging in peaceful protest
6619228 the failure of the indonesian government to extradite siagian and his continued service in the indonesian armed forces are signs of the indonesian governments lack of commitment to justice and accountability
6619229 about the legal proceedings concerning the individuals that were wanted by interpol for their implication in the east timor conflict one of them was a colonel currently serving with the indonesian military command was the government planning to arrest this individual and respect its obligations under interpol also the question of sending such commanders from one hot spot to the other had not been addressed
6619230 that man shall drink from any cup and not be harmed
6619231 so not only are those who question the beliefs of the fanitical christian fated to eternal
6619232 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6619233 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6619234 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6619235 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6619236 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6619237 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6619238 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6619239 i would not know what to do or how to put flows together
6619240 i prefer to be in a yoga studio with other people
6619241 e um fator para a forma o de fibras musculares el sticas e col genas sintetizadas a partir de seus amino cidos essenciais

6619245 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6619246 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6619247 no pretendas disfrazar algo que ya es bello puede que resulte m s atractivo pero no deja de ser bello
6619248 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6619249 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6619250 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
6619251 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6619252 you will see a lot of satin and lace combined and rich colors such as burgundy and beige silver and peach as well as your classic black and white
6619253 it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it
6619254 i love watching the amazing race and the 10 challenge is similar to that
6619255 it sounded like heaps of fun and it is for a very worthy cause too i asked lance if he would be keen and he said yes we sent off our application to fairfax media head office and hoped for the best we received an email saying we were shortlisted but we had to do something special to convince the selection team we were the right people for the job
6619256 your selection provides fairfax media with its first south island entry in the event lance will also be the first editor to expose himself to challenges which punctuate the weeks leading up to the race
6619257 the race itself is going to be great fun but the fundraising is what the 10 challenge is all about
6619258 we are planning some fun events including an auction with some good prizes and a major celebrity master of ceremonies as well as an advertising feature raffles and other fundraising ventures we will be tapping a few people on the shoulder asking for help over the next few weeks hopefully the community can get behind us and help to raise loads of money and the profile of the cure kids organisation
6619259 the hope is that more retailers and foodservice organizations are going to join us in this effort
6619260 gsfi is our greatest opportunity to create a universal standard of safe food and advance food safety and the quality of life for consumers around the world
6619261 we released people early so they could get home safely
6619262 we do need water we have been in a three year drought but we dont like that much water at one time
6619263 there are quite a few people in marlborough who have cystic fibrosis from kids to older people
6619264 the consumer who purchases items eligible to be paid for by their fsa is a shopper with untapped potential in the health beauty wellness categories at retail
6619265 this white paper helps outline to our retail members what is needed for the jan 1 mandate on implementing inventory information approval systems as well
6619266 the sealed envelopes containing the names of mm and dd be opened and be made available for public inspection
6619267 right now they owe me i think they should have a statue of me in the tax office
6619268 hey fuckhead dont send me this crap its not clever
6619269 i am often asked how it feels to be a robot i dont know i have never been anything else
6619270 zeno was originally a toy robot until one day his owner left him plugged in and he downloaded a lot of information and became self aware
6619271 we are very pleased with the way things progressed we had 13 featured artists that shined all the projects were brilliant and far exceeded their original proposals
6619272 i dont know yet what it will be i am going to pull inspiration from energy around me
6619273 cleveland is wonderful i love coming here just look at all the wonderful things you have here to enjoy
6619274 roberto was a fantastic performer composer and director and the band is still wonderful because they are following his vision
6619275 this is absolutely wonderful we need the culture back in our lives
6619276 the garage grooves is for the community to come out and enjoy the museum and the performances
6619277 it is time that a government thought very seriously about what excise is actually achieving and the impact it is having on our industry
6619278 if we do not do better in this area the productive sector in new zealand particularly the many small and medium sized businesses that operate in industries such as ours will suffocate under an ever increasing bureaucratic dead weight
6619279 governments face demands to reduce and demands to create compliance costs
6619280 from our point of view they are not mutually exclusive
6619281 itd be good for them to stay away until theyre well until the symptoms are gone
6619282 weve been heavily hit with it were taking 70 messages calling in sick maybe 100 plus for this week and last week
6619283 were finding the average stay away is three or five days but some are coming back after only one day chest infections are predominant and weve had a couple of cases of students developing pneumonia even one staff member
6619284 weve got a few weeks yet to persevere and with exams coming up at the end of term
6619285 its particularly noticeable in assembly the halls strangely empty its been this way all week
6619286 we dont know if its peaked yet were at a high point so far but we may see more cases its highly likely
6619287 the state has a responsibility to ensure that all children receive an adequate standard of education and checks will be made to ensure that any child being kept away from public school is being properly educated
6619288 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6619289 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6619290 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6619291 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6619292 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6619293 well mummy needs to go now whether youre coming or not
6619294 no mummy does that mean my have to stay here
6619295 mummys coming back in just a minute mummy will be back soon
6619296 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6619297 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6619298 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6619299 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6619300 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6619301 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6619302 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6619303 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6619304 bapak ibu guru sekarang tidak lagi sebagai satu satunya sumber informasi tetapi lebih banyak sebagai fasilitator dalam proses belajar mengajar
6619305 hes my mentor i went down to christchurch every weekend while i was injured hes on the mend and hopefully not far away from coming home
6619306 things didnt quite go my way last year i probably didnt progress a bit of attitude stuff im focused now i want to make a mark and play well its awesome this year the best team environment ive been in we are best mates
6619307 toddy hes just brought us all together a bit of leadership team culture hes just a good guy if he was in charge of a ping pong team theyd go well
6619308 everyone has a lot more clarity around their roles and you are encouraged to express your own skills
6619309 solzhenitsyn anticipated the persistence of the old and unrepentant lites the former communist party chiefs and k g b officials who so easily transformed themselves into democrats and businessmen
6619310 part of the na ve fable was that the collapse of the soviet union would peaceably defy historical precedent
6619311 putin is not hitler or stalin he is not even leonid brezhnev he is what he is and that is bad enough in the 2008 election he made a joke of democratic procedure and in effect engineered for himself an anti constitutional third term the press the parliament the judiciary the business lite are all in his pocket and there is no opposition but putin also knows that russia cannot bear the cost of reconstituting empire or the gulag it depends on the west as a market one lesson of the soviet experience is that isolation ends in poverty putins is a new and subtler game he is the autocrat who calls on the widow of aleksandr solzhenitsyn
6619312 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6619313 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6619314 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6619315 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6619316 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6619317 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6619318 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6619319 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6619320 new york hardcore 1986 1993 out please go to my myspace page for it
6619321 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6619322 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year
6619323 if the default pricing formula was kept beyond next season it would create a real risk of processors making investment decisions that are economically unsustainable
6619324 introduction of an auction from the 2010 11 season will remove uncertainty for fonterra independent producers and for farmers
6619325 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
6619326 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
6619327 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
6619328 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
6619329 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
6619330 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
6619331 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
6619332 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
6619333 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
6619334 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
6619335 were anticipating that well have a whole lot of names come in
6619336 a lot of it is commonsense like not using a long name for a short street it needs to be able to fit on a map
6619337 that can take three months it just doesnt seem sensible to hold up a development for the sake of a name
6619338 they sometimes struggled because they didnt have much time to put into it this method should come up with some well thought out names
6619339 hes been great and i think its translating to some good things on the field
6619340 he just came in fit in and everyone welcomed him each and every day hes been getting more and more comfortable with everyone here
6619341 once chemistry out on the field develops you can gradually get toward that point where you dont have to do anything verbally you can just understand each other and get a good feel for each other on the field
6619342 he threatens the defense and threatens the entire field so there arent any clear out routes you have to be available on each and every route
6619343 some routes youre not the primary guy but with brett you may end up the primary guy so you have to stay honest on each and every route
6619344 i just know theres a lot of zip on the ball
6619345 it helps especially when youre trying to fit into tight spots especially against man coverage hes fitting into those spots so it lets you know youre going to have the opportunity to make a play
6619346 it was a little frustrating at first because i kind of had my mind set on one thing just playing will
6619347 but after doing it for a couple of weeks now its turned out to be a good thing because im learning the whole defense
6619348 sometimes i feel that way but im just trying to be positive about it
6619349 on one side i feel like they dont know what to do with me but im just trying to use it as an opportunity to learn the whole defense
6619350 i think they are just trying to get everyone familiar with all the spots because you never know whats going to happen
6619351 guys have been banged up even in camp they are trying to get us all familiar
6619352 no one has won the spot but i feel like i have a great opportunity to win it
6619353 ive got to go out and have a spectacular game this weekend and follow it up in our last game of the preseason and i think ill be in good shape im very optimistic about winning the spot but at the same time i know i have a lot of work to do
6619354 right now we need to know what the expectation is
6619355 david akan menjadi perekrutan yang bagus buat kami dia punya banyak pengalaman di level top dan rekor internasionalnya fenomenal
6619356 weekend ini pasti berbeda buatku karena ini sebuah tragedi semua warga spanyol syok dan saya juga
6619357 saya akan mengenakan ban hitam dan akan berbicara dengan pembalap pembalap lain besok mungkin kita bisa melakukan sesuatu sebelum memulai mungkin hening satu menit di
6619358 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6619359 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6619360 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6619361 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6619362 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6619363 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6619364 most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations
6619365 i thought you had done enough research knew enough about it
6619366 have you ever had a critical look on anything saying anthropogenic global warming is real
6619367 i think its a pity you stay on the wordgame
6619368 please man dont get me on the words now with a lawyers trick you know what i mean
6619369 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6619370 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6619371 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6619372 i dont think it is really right that he walks away with nothing
6619373 what if it was a child or his mother or brother or sister
6619374 if somebody is beating on my door i would think they are in trouble
6619375 youre just not up at six in the morning with a pistol in your lap
6619376 he was all the way around a really nice guy real genuine
6619377 its a false positive he got tested positive for something he didnt take
6619378 i will not let my fighter sit back and be wronged like this i just wont
6619379 i did not use the steroid boldenone or any other steroid of prohibited substance
6619380 i dont agree and never have agreed with the use of this kind of product in order to win for this is cheating i will go to the full extent of my power and the law to prove my innocence in this matter
6619381 he cant take stuff like that because he has acromegaly
6619382 all of his hormone levels are a problem regularly so he wouldnt be able to for risk of his life
6619383 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6619384 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament and appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the memorandum of understanding which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6619385 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6619386 while c sections should always be available to a mother in need having a c section is risky to both mother and child
6619387 how many cases of children with hypoxia cerebral palsy are we willing to tolerate in return for simply reducing our c section rate
6619388 id agree with that but id also have to say that the number of c sections we do is still too high
6619389 the u s centers for disease control and prevention says we should have no more than 15 percent of low risk births delivered by c section
6619390 its important for us to know whats driving this increase
6619391 basically there were about 10 percent more c sections in puget sound than we would have expected to see when compared to the rest of the state
6619392 one of our remaining questions is why there was this geographical variation
6619393 i havent seen any evidence that would support those statements
6619394 what it really tells us is that we need more attention given to womens health in general
6619395 at least they could then react quickly if there was an attack
6619396 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
6619397 we have been working on the series 60 platform for touchscreen user interface and a mobile device is expected to be launched by the year end
6619398 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how withdrawal might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6619399 goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6619400 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to get out of a bad situation the agreement is based on success
6619401 i was not in the last eight years part of anybodys elite circle
6619402 wheres the beef so mccain and the republicans have failed to link him to extreme liberalism radicalism rev wright or any of the identifications they have been trying to pin on the democrat both campaigns have almost totally failed to move past square one on obama
6619403 although many studies such as those by the united nations environment programme finance initiative unep fi show a positive association between investors use of esg criteria and enhanced financial performance the data is still inconclusive and mainstream investors remain skeptical
6619404 this report looks beyond socially responsible investors and explores how mainstream financial institutions can advance the use of esg criteria to maximize financial performance
6619405 ill have to punish you all my pretty little song birds and nothing can help you now
6619406 im sure someone read their report wrong willow shes fine see im even calling her now

6619416 then lo and behold within ten minutes of entering the house i was getting married
6619417 the public shows were just pretend it was very hard and in the end it was very hard
6619418 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6619419 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6619420 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6619421 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
6619422 you need to let go let it slip away otherwise itll be tied to you forever
6619423 gotta make it to the hunt before someone else gets hurt
6619424 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6619425 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6619426 im pretty sure were at or very close to the bottom here in true values the only thing that could throw things out of whack is if there is a nasty recession or a year or two of nasty inflation that would push interest rates up and prices would have to come down but i dont see either one of those happening so i think were very close to the bottom

6619548 when a total tentative agreement is reached through negotiating the outcome shall be reduced to writing and submitted to the association for ratification and then to the board for formal approval pursuant to the timeliness prescribed by the orc 4117 10

6619638 bartonplace condominium and the pecan grove park are working together to attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement concerning construction matters both parties are optimistic that a mutually acceptable resolution will be achieved shortly
6619639 being sent on behalf of both bartonplace and pecan grove park
6619640 when bartonplace was approved neighbors in pecan grove were very upset of course

6619643 setting up the wii using the systems myriad controllers getting the most out of channels and recommendations for games and accessories
6619644 i would kill for a solid tennis game on the wii
6619645 you cant ask for any more than of the guys they left very everything out there but honestly we just didnt play well enough today they were just too good for us
6619646 the guys just gave it their all i mean there are some disappointed boys and they have not had the privilege of playing off for a gold medal
6619647 i am just disappointed i let them guys down i suppose
6619648 some of these guys are good enough to play another four years and i am sure they will be there in london
6619649 we need to do the re group thing we need to make sure we are strong mentally

6619651 the maoists will have to prove them wrong their election manifesto called this the era of capitalist democracy in nepal and stressed that the private sector is intrinsic to their plans more immediately prachanda must reassert the authority of the state which has been badly eroded over the past two years as crime has spiralled and ethnic groups clamoured for their rights
6619652 it would be fantastic for south east queensland and the whole region and would bring enormous opportunities across the board
6619653 i think the only issues we would have would be coping with the infrastructure and the sheer magnitude of the games
6619654 transport is only one component financially socially and from a skills perspective there would need to be an enormous investment
6619655 organisers would also need to do a lot of research into its feasibility
6619656 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6619657 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6619658 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans

6619667 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6619668 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6619669 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6619670 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6619671 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6619672 we were really letting massillon dictate the pace of the game
6619673 at halftime we wanted to pick up the pace of the game a little bit we wanted to be a little more aggressive and we were able to do that we came out and played a much better second half
6619674 we were only able to score on one of them it just seemed like we were playing at a pace which was slow and without any aggression
6619675 we have five new kids in the back and its just a matter of overcoming the difficulties
6619676 on a couple of instances on goal kicks where we were out of position and they just shoved it back down our throats it was a good learning experience
6619677 i had the chance to drive in the games first run and didnt do it and that changes the whole game right there
6619678 when i have that chance i have to come through
6619679 that says a lot obviously this is a lot different team with ken griffey jr and adam dunn gone but we still have to produce runs we cant use that as an excuse we had chances and we do have people capable of doing it
6619680 we had zambrano sort of on the ropes early because he wasnt sharp
6619681 but he got out of the first inning with no runs leaving a runner on third with less than two outs that was crucial and when you give zambrano 13 5 3 29 an early lead he knows what to do with it
6619682 nobody gets a lot of runs against the cubs staff
6619683 arent they no 1 in the league second other than the four runs we gave up in the eighth inning of the first game we held their offense down pretty good too
6619684 we played a good series and just came up a run short from winning the series
6619685 we played good defense but we just lacked some timely hitting
6619686 fogg wasnt throwing the ball badly but when you are facing a guy like zambrano you cant give him too much of a lead
6619687 when you have an opportunity to score runs you have to take it
6619688 we were at the bottom of order and we were pushing the envelope all day hit and runs stealing
6619689 all my guys unless i stop em if they think they have the base stolen they can take it that pitch happened to be a fastball up a pretty good pitch for catcher henry blanco to throw
6619690 the pitching staff is solid enough to win plenty of ballgames
6619691 we really need a starting catcher unless they are going to go with ryan hanigan and i havent seen him enough we need a solid guy you can run out there five days a week a guy who can hit a little bit a regular guy instead of dividing it up between a couple of guys
6619692 were going to need two other guys who can hit probably outfielders
6619693 our infield is decently set if shortstop alex gonzalez comes back so we need a couple of outfielders to replace those home runs we lost adam dunn ken griffey jr
6619694 we just need a lineup from top to bottom that feels the same when we pitch against the other teams lineup so we dont have as many weak spots
6619695 i mean with the cubs im facing a seven hole hitter like mark derosa who hits 280 thats the feeling we need to project to other teams
6619696 we have enough right now in our starting staff and bullpen to win this division for sure
6619697 woke up with it tuesday morning after sleeping on one of those darned soft hotel pillows
6619698 it is just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do on an 0 and 2 pitch try to trick em instead of going right at them
6619699 also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength
6619700 theyre told a hitter is weak if you go hard inside but the pitchers strength isnt throwing hard inside do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
6619701 i guess thats why pete has twice as many hits as me
6619702 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6619703 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them
6619704 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6619705 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6619706 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6619707 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6619708 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6619709 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6619710 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6619711 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6619712 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding
6619713 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6619714 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6619715 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby
6619716 the girls did a good job getting off to good start in matches and then putting them away when they had their chances
6619717 gilmour is very good and we did fight very hard but we just couldnt pull any of the matches out
6619718 it really disturbs me right now with all the people on silver spring leaving
6619719 if we play our cards right we can easily piggyback off of bayshore
6619720 if we stand idly by and fail to improve our business district
6619721 could be a real cool eclectic complement to the more mainstream retail in bayshore

6619725 democrats with barack obama have done a good job energizing the electorate that coupled with people disgruntled about the purchase of the raceway and the third thing is i have an opponent who has knocked on a lot of doors
6619726 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6619727 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6619728 i usually do a good job of getting out of those problems
6619729 its not like those errors would have ended the inning im not making good pitches after that
6619730 i had to battle the double plays were big give credit to the offense when you get five runs in the first three innings it gives you some cushion
6619731 youre going to get yourself in tough situations and you have to limit the damage
6619732 cliff has done a good job of that this season
6619733 whats taken place the last eight years isnt what i want
6619734 i feel like voting for mccain and the republicans is saying were happy with the way things are and im not
6619735 i think mccain will do very well we have a lot of retired military people in rio rancho and if they get out and vote
6619736 republicans and independents are coming over theyre angry at the bush administration and mccain has the exact same policies
6619737 a lot of my friends are terrified obama might get elected
6619738 so you have this combination going on in this county and as it continues to grow it has an impact
6619739 maybe im wrong but i dont think my vote even counts
6619740 if i couldnt depend on them i might as well just shoot myself
6619741 i couldnt care less about his color we all bleed red
6619742 if this country is so great why the hell does he want to change it
6619743 because bush has put us in such a chaotic mess
6619744 nobody knows what a president is going to do until he gets there theres no training for that job
6619745 the most important thing is that obama offers hope for the future

6619854 this sort of led the rage of yogurt in the 80s what i like about tcby is it has about 20 percent of your calcium needs in half of a cup and there are actually seven probiotics in it those healthy cultures however it still is so easily over consumed there is corn syrup added so theres extra added sugar and a half a cup adds up fast most people have at least two to three times that and theyre eating it every night after dinner thinking its healthy its just yogurt it needs to be a replacement for a treat
6619855 lots of flavor smooth and creamy hundreds of flavors its all natural there no artificial sweetener but its not yogurt they dont claim to be yogurt they are a dairy frozen desert i like that its all natural
6619856 its so popular so im going to have to say its not as healthy as it is popular people think because of their two flavors the tart plain and the green tea theyre such healthy flavors that oh theyre just as healthy as eating regular yogurt regular plain yogurt versus the pinkberry is going to have a lot more calcium a lot more protein a lot less sugar and a many fewer calories so you still need to be really careful when youre eating pinkberry it is a treat it should be a replacement for your ice cream indulgence
6619857 how fast can one man go before you cant go faster
6619858 she is so intent on getting married and having children he felt hemmed in after a 20 minute phone conversation he just said i cant take it anymore and hung up
6619859 0 to me 10 to b and 90 to c
6619860 the thought there is putting our best 11 players on the field defensively
6619861 that and getting a bigger physical presence at the middle linebacker spot he is a downhill guy in the box who is going to really be a physical presence in there i think that helps us across the board
6619862 were just trying to improve as a defense get some speed out there make some moves
6619863 guys are being team players right now everybody is trying to do their role so we have a better defensive unit
6619864 im happy to take it on i want that responsibility i want to be in position to lead this defense im extremely excited
6619865 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6619866 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6619867 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6619868 it kills the bacteria makes it so they are not able to reproduce and make you sick
6619869 its a high tech solution to problems that should be solved earlier in the food chain
6619870 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6619871 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6619872 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6619873 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6619874 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6619875 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6619876 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6619877 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6619878 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6619879 well do an autposy on the whale to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6619880 im not going to teach your boyfriend how to dance with you
6619881 after our first trip to china my wife and i knew our lives were changing our eyes and hearts were opening to how big god really is and we have wanted to experience more of that
6619882 weve really wondered whether or not we should just go to china and stay there
6619883 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6619884 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6619885 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6619886 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6619887 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6619888 right now there are not many good options for these people
6619889 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6619890 a unit of cultural information such as a cultural practice or idea that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another

6619897 las m s afectadas con el modesto desempe o econ mico son las pymes que generan la mayor parte del empleo total y al no contar con la suficiente demanda para sus productos y enfrentar complicadas situaciones crediticias optan por reducir la plantilla laboral o bien dedicarse a la importaci n ya que les favorece el tipo de cambio

6619929 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try and avoid this being an election issue she will not drown out the voice of the people and should realise there is no point further angering everyone by delaying the inevitable

6619940 over many generations the river has been polluted and degraded
6619941 the clean up of the waikato river will be one of the most important environmental undertakings in new zealands history

6619954 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6619955 doesnt surprise me at all doesnt surprise me because as you get people who dont fully immunize their children were going to see more and more cases like this and thats a very scary thing
6619956 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6619957 were more concerned about the rising rates of autism than contracting measles
6619958 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing

6619969 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology

6619971 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6619972 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6619973 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6619984 as an american i do not feel that the israelis are obligated or required to give up land in order to bring peace
6619985 you do not achieve peace by creating a situation where you cannot defend your borders and therefore protect your citizens having a temporary cessation of hostility is not peace if while that cessation of hostility is going on just across the border arms are being built up for the purpose of eventually pushing that border down

6619991 we would hardly tolerate it if the israelis said we dont recognize washington d
