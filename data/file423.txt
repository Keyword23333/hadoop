4230130 i think a great example of this is the federal excise tax that was created to help pay for the spanish american war that was only rescinded a few short years ago
4230131 the irs realized that most employers arent following those rules
4230132 and that way the tax burden shifts to the employee and the university has no exposure because were giving the employee additional wages to go out and buy their own phone
4230133 and it was pretty easy to track them because only a few people had them things have changed and the tax code needs to catch up with it

4230175 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
4230176 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
4230177 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
4230178 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
4230179 offer strong evidence of the correlation between low level radiation exposure and result ing health damages
4230180 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
4230181 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
4230182 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
4230183 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
4230184 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
4230185 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
4230186 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
4230187 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
4230188 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
4230189 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
4230190 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
4230191 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
4230192 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
4230193 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
4230194 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
4230195 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
4230196 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
4230197 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
4230198 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
4230199 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
4230200 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
4230201 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
4230202 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
4230203 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004
4230204 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4230205 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4230206 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4230207 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4230208 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families

4230210 if iran wants to enrich uranium if it wants to handle the nuclear issue in a peaceful way like brazil does that is irans right

4230225 non siamo riusciti a cambiarlo ma non c nulla di vero in quello che dicono gli vogliamo bene
4230226 abbiamo sempre cercato di cambiarlo per quello che potevamo per non ci siamo mai riusciti

4230229 buyers see and hear stories about the collapse of the national housing market everywhere and that makes them afraid to move forward with a purchase
4230230 much of the savings in prices was consumed by higher interest rates leaving buyers frustrated that they are not benefitting from price declines as they expected
4230231 after repeated complaints they finally installed air conditioning in the sleeping quarters however most of the equipment was so old that it didnt work
4230232 the food is the worst thing weve had the same two courses for dinner for a year sometimes there hasnt been enough for everyone those who have arrived last havent got anything to eat
4230233 we never get noodles or dumplings all we get is rice
4230234 we were proud at being chosen to take part we all had great dreams about what we were going to do what we were going to see and what big stars we would become but all weve seen is the inside of this military camp the only thing we dream of now is going home
4230235 in the end the pupils got enough to eat even if the diet was extremely monotonous

4230237 but the organizers have promised them an olympic certificate thanking them for their effort they will not receive pay nevertheless i think that the majority will think that it was good to do what they did for the olympics and their country
4230238 cadbury schweppes plc amp cadbury schweppes overseas ltd v commissioners of inland revenue
4230239 the uk tax authorities will press on with defending the countrys controlled foreign company rules even though a high court judge decided on july 4 that they should be scrapped in their current form
4230240 it is to me a surprising proposition that the court can by judicial legislation add a further condition for the application of section 748 3 in order to cure the invalidity of a statutory provision that would not otherwise comply with european law and be enforceable against certain taxpayers
4230241 the cfc legislation which depends on section 747 and section 748 for its effectiveness must be disapplied so that pending such amending legislation or executive action no charge can be imposed on a company such as vodafone under the cfc legislation
4230242 it follows that hmrcs enquiry into vodafones tax return for the accounting period has no legitimate purpose and should be closed
4230243 hmrc intends to appeal this decision and the government will continue to defend its ability to enforce the cfc rules which are designed to counter tax avoidance through artificial shifting of profits to offshore subsidiaries
4230244 non dom clients will be more positive about things than before
4230245 but it would have been better to consult first rather than issue draconian proposals that upset a lot of people
4230246 i understand that member states need to ensure that their tax bases are not unduly eroded because of abusive and overtly aggressive tax planning schemes but the commission as guardian of the treaties cannot tolerate disproportionate obstacles to cross border activity within the eu
4230247 the infringement at stake again reveals that there is a need for better coordination of national anti abuse tax rules as the commission stressed in its december 2007 communication on anti abuse rules in the area of direct taxation ip 07 1878 i invite all member states and not only spain to explore the scope for constructive and coordinated responses which would strike a proper balance between the protection of national tax bases and the need to observe the freedoms of the treaties

4230250 between christianity in predominately african american churches and true biblical christian experience
4230251 christianity in america and particularly the predominantly african american expression of christianity has sought to be a biblical faith and reformed theology has presented the most biblically consistent expression of christianity and christian thought known to the world
4230252 reformed theology when rightly understood and proclaimed is the most truly experiential form of christianity
4230253 reformed theology has presented the most biblically consistent expression of christianity and christian thought known to the world
4230254 reformed theology is the hope of christianity and it has been the hope of christianity since the reformation and it continues to be the hope today
4230255 the most biblically consistent expression of christianity and christian thought known to the world
4230256 yet i now feel disconnected i am disconnected not necessarily from god but from the church
4230257 what the reformed evangelical and prosperity churches have in common is an emphasis on individualism neither of which can ultimately satisfy a regenerated child of god created and now recreated in the image of an internally relational internal economy triune god
4230258 sad illustration of a man who thinks he experienced god when perhaps all he experienced was religious experience itself and could use a christianity that does not simply accentuate the novel and promote the excitable

4230263 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4230264 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4230265 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4230327 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4230328 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4230329 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4230330 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4230331 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4230332 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4230333 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4230334 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4230335 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4230336 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4230337 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4230338 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4230339 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4230340 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4230341 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4230342 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4230343 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4230344 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4230345 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4230346 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4230347 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4230348 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4230349 to honour this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors
4230350 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4230351 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4230352 to honour and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4230353 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4230354 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4230355 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to senator barack obama
4230356 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit

4230384 because we do not know when we are going to die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well and yet everything happens only a certain number of times and a very small number really how many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you cannot conceive of your life without it perhaps four five times more perhaps not even that how many times will you watch the full moon rise perhaps twenty and yet it all seems limitless
4230385 as previously reported the company executed on several important milestones in the first quarter
4230386 most important were the results of the cardiac study at the cleveland clinic florida where a dramatic clinical improvement was demonstrated in no option cardiac patients an effect comparable to patients who do have surgical options and undergo costly and invasive angioplasty procedures future studies are planned with established research facilities in cardiovascular ischemia to establish clear dose and response curves the potential importance of our technology in the treatment of cardio vascular disease which affects over 16 million people in the u s alone cannot be overstated while we will of course continue to expand our presence and seek opportunities in the wound care post surgical and pain areas which have been the companys historical areas of concentration the cardiovascular area now represents the key future focus and investment priority for the company
4230387 on the wound care side of our business our overall strategy of creating awareness and demonstrating clinical and economic viability as a means to drive utilization and adoption are showing concrete results one of our largest distributors is having success securing insurance coverage through the implementation of a solution based formulary for the treatment of chronic wounds which features our tpemf tm technology we are also on the verge of securing a national account agreement with one of the largest long term acute care hospital organizations in the country following a successful multi site trial we will continue to utilize these successes in the field to attract potential marketing partners discussions are continuing and we hope to see the result of these efforts before years end
4230388 regarding the 510 k the company voluntarily submitted for the sofpulse m 10 roma and torino pemf products the company filed a formal appeal under fda regulations but cannot determine when a decision will be made by the fda as we previously stated we continue to believe based on regulations and guidance by our independent expert consultants that all our products are covered by the clearance provided in 1991
4230389 we look forward to the resolution of our 510 k issue with the fda however it is important to note that tpemf tm products we intend to utilize for the osteoarthritis as well as the cardiac and neurology indications are distinct devices and will need separate clearance from the fda for such indication our technology has the potential to address a number of significant markets where inflammation is believed to play a role however as i indicated earlier with the cardio vascular opportunity offering the greatest potential future return on investment for the company

4230438 traveling can get lonely so for some the solution is to have someone in each port
4230439 we live in a world that is tailor made for lying
4230440 when people socialize in different environments they dont necessarily have to tell the whole truth about themselves because theres no one there to call them out
4230441 theyre dating a guy theyve met on the web and they dont know anything about him
4230442 in many cases we find that the men already have girlfriends
4230443 more times than not they genuinely care about the people theyre involved with
4230444 i was in love with a sweet down to earth woman when i met this adventurous party girl and fell hard i admit at first it was just plain cheating but then i found myself in serious relationships with both and couldnt decide between them it was torturous
4230445 they get a rush from the near misses and crafty planning that it takes
4230446 i got off on the cloak and dagger aspect the constant fear that one of the girls might show up made life exciting
4230447 men like the ego boost of having more than one person whos devoted to them
4230448 if things dont work out with one guy at least they have the other one
4230449 when things started to get serious with two men i realized that i didnt have to sit around waiting for the phone to ring anymore like id always done finally i was running the show
4230450 i keep the different groups in my life separate i rarely tell my roommates where i am and i dont fill my parents in on my love life im already kind of flighty so when my girlfriends cant reach me they just think its typical
4230451 if one of my guys wanted to come over while i was with the other one id walk into another room and say im so tired i can hardly move off the couch
4230452 after a while though it became too emotionally taxing to keep up
4230453 they end up settling on one partner because the manipulating becomes too draining
4230454 in other cases their feelings for one person become so strong that the other person becomes a burden
4230455 they say this is all i need to get by the truth is baby its a liiiiiiiiiiiiieeeee

4230469 wait a minute yes we do care a lot about these children how could you possibly suggest that we dont care about orphaned or neglected children
4230470 the books are too hard to read theres too much symbolism i dont want to be forced to read i am never going to use this in the real world
4230471 as the masochistic teenage mother to be of a monster a fetus that breaks her ribs when it kicks she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant
4230472 she adamantly refuses an abortion which even edward begs her to consider
4230473 wait a minute yes we do care a lot about these children how could you possibly suggest that we dont care about orphaned or neglected children
4230474 what if the abortion messed things up somehow what if theres scar tissue from that preventing pregnancy now
4230475 that abortion could have been my only chance and i threw it away
4230476 when looking at all american women those who have had an abortion have the same average level of emotional health as those who have not had an abortion
4230477 the study implicates that having an abortion causes no more cases of mental trauma than not having an abortion causes
4230478 oh that baby would be about eight by now i wonder what he she would have been like
4230479 awful dirty painful wrong shameful omg you will never recover or bounce back and your life will be far more ruined than if you just kept the child because 8 cells are people too
4230480 that would have led to a whole different set of mental traumas
4230481 hi im interested in you but not enough to actually take the time to write
4230482 we are pleased that steven gluckstern has agreed to take on the role of president and ceo of ivivi technologies
4230483 since going public nearly two years ago the company has made major strides demonstrating both the clinical efficacy and science behind targeted pulsed electromagnetic field tpemf tm as illustrated most recently with the promising results from the cardiac study at the cleveland clinic florida having a seasoned executive with significant entrepreneurial and managerial experience at the helm will be essential as we continue to prioritize our clinical scientific research and business development with a focus on cardiology while continuing to grow revenue from our existing ancillary markets of wound care and post surgical edema and pain
4230484 i am excited to have the opportunity to join ivivi full time
4230485 i look forward to working closely with andre and david and the rest of the ivivi team to help our tpemf tm technology gain market acceptance as an important treatment modality particularly in the treatment of serious cardiovascular disease

4230500 judging the race so far however one would have to conclude that franken is a poor fit with minnesota voters franken cannot conceal that he is not a nice guy and minnesotans are genuinely nice people i think that more than anything has held franken back so far

4230505 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
4230506 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
4230507 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
4230508 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
4230509 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
4230510 winter storms are complex weather systems that can produce various types and combinations of damage from different perils making them extremely challenging to model
4230511 using a unique approach we have broken new ground by analyzing the individual and combined impacts of snow ice freezing temperatures and wind to provide much more accurate damage estimates
4230512 while there is solid evidence that the high price of gas has reduced the number of miles driven it would be a mistake to assume that this means there will be lower insurance claims reporting and as a result lower insurance premiums for consumers
4230513 not all of these risks have to materialize but some could
4230514 dollar strength will not be a straight line nevertheless dollar lows are almost certainly behind us
4230515 not all time is created equal as of friday we face two weeks of late summer that see notoriously high traffic in the hamptons and notoriously low traffic in the pits
4230516 perhaps the simplest way to account for this is to avoid watching the actual vix for the next couple weeks and
4230517 the hard truth is that lenders want to be repaid and changing terms of a home loans not at the top of their list right now
4230518 if a lender wants to freeze rates for six months that doesnt give the homeowner a lot of time to get back on their feet
4230519 but in cases where theyll freeze for years at a time thats long enough to restore credit save money and build equity in the home
4230520 sometimes theres no choice but to accept foreclosure if the situation cant improve

4230526 hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency

4230553 if at amp t deploys these technologies and processes and we have yet to do so it will do so the right way only after full and careful consideration of the relevant issues and with a particular focus on what we believe are the pillars of any business practices that involve customer information
4230554 if done properly overall behavioral targeted advertising could prove quite valuable to consumers and could dramatically improve their online experiences while at the same time protecting their privacy
4230555 goes beyond the simple practice of targeting limited to a consumers use of individual or related web sites and involves the more invisible practice of tracking consumer web activity across countless unrelated web sites and therefore has unique implications for consumer privacy
4230556 we would encourage any entity that engages in overall behavioral targeted advertising to adopt such principles and urge that any legal or regulatory framework that governs such practices embody these principles and be applied equally to all players in the online advertising ecosystem

4230562 this conduct is indeed more proximate to the creation of illegal copying than say operating an isp or opening a copy shop nonetheless we do not think it sufficiently proximate to the copying to displace the customers as the person who makes the copies

4230604 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4230605 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4230606 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4230613 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4230614 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4230615 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4230624 librarians can play a key role in getting individual faculty members to understand the importance of placing articles in the repository
4230625 they tend to be much more knowledgeable about these issues of the repositories and open access and the importance not only for mass distribution but for the faculty member him or herself of making articles available with open access so that connection with faculty provides a perfect venue to facilitate the process of moving articles from filing cabinets and computers in the faculty members office into the repository

4230644 the first thing courtney said to me was will you read my short i happily did
4230645 then i called her and said lets do this we shot the short she edited it showed it to me and said good job then she said would you like to do the feature i didnt even know she had a feature
4230646 there were unanswered questions in the short we didnt even know the characters at that time were the native and the blonde they had no names
4230647 courtney gave me a valuable piece of direction right before we shot the feature
4230648 watch john wayne thats probably the most consistent piece of direction throughout the rest of the filming process its a little bit of the duke
4230649 the natives have a lot of female tribal heads you see the portrayal of the tribal meetings in the film to be heavily female which is an accurate portrayal of those types of meetings
4230650 in our film this is women doing what women do to get by especially when the men have let them down
4230651 the strength of the film is the story a story that most people havent heard before
4230652 its a rich story because it encompasses all those themes
4230653 the two women have learned something have grown and are better people by the end of the film because of the journey the audience watches them go through
4230654 we are here to grow into our best selves that is my religion whatever can get you there and whatever the trials that is what betters us that is how the story of this film is played out

4230671 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4230672 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4230673 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4230674 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4230677 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4230678 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4230679 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4230680 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4230681 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4230682 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4230683 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4230684 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4230685 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4230686 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran

4230708 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there

4230719 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible
4230720 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living

4230722 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4230723 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4230724 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4230725 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4230734 sean how can you make a case like that he was dating cindy mccain while he was married to somebody else he had the capacity to date her but he cant be with his wife that if youre a pow you can cheat on your wife
4230735 you know what he wasnt the same person when he got back for a short period of time and why cant you understand and put that in context
4230736 he sampled life in the worlds most exclusive club as he escorted its members on trips around the globe sitting with the sultan of oman on the floor of his desert tent or smuggling a senators private supply of scotch through saudi arabian customs

4230743 what sorts of references would be preferable professional academic or both
4230744 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
4230745 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
4230746 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
4230747 i have yet to do any real fieldwork in the archaeology would this play a role in getting accepted into this program
4230748 the utilities would constitute a gift because it is something that he up until recently was not paying
4230749 now that he has paid it he cant argue that it was included in the rent clearly it was a gift at the time because he failed to pay it adds to the issue that the ethics community should be looking at the whole arrangement was inappropriate and violated ethics rule
4230750 take the senator at his word hes been remarkably transparent open and honest about the entire situation
4230751 clearly it would have been good to have a written lease which is why they have one now

4230767 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4230768 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust

4230816 the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one

4231029 hes a great guy to take the time to help a younger guy but im going to have to pick it up on my own now
4231030 we wish him a great recovery and weve got to move on its the whole defensive lines responsibility to help in those situations that hollis has left open from his injury but i dont feel any pressure personally
4231031 that is a big void to full hollis is one of those guys who really prides himself on protecting the linebackers and keeping the double teams off the linebackers so thats the kind of guy you love to have in front of you
4231032 with the new guy obviously hes got a whole different level of athleticism thats going to help him get a lot more involved in rushing the passer and making plays on the ball

4231035 we hope to be able to go in as soon as possible
4231036 those remaining behind are perhaps anywhere from 35 000 to 50 000 people thats what we are preparing ourselves for we are getting desperate phone calls from people who stayed behind
4231037 we see a need for basic things such as food water and hygiene items at the shelter centres we are visiting both in and around tbilisi and in zugdidi in western georgia
4231038 these people in temporary shelters are really left without anything
4231039 we have already assisted 1 400 people in ten centres around tbilisi but the authorities say they have registered some 28 000
4231040 after two days of poor security conditions one of our teams which included surgeons was able to go back to gori today to evaluate and attend to medical and general needs there another is on its way to zugdidi

4231131 this aberration is typical of the woods men counting unknown generations back the men of the family quit working when they turn 80 if they live to be 80 and they totally rely on the women of the house to carry on with the chores grandpa says its his due
4231132 grandma he knows how to do everything around here he cut the grass and planted the gardens he always made his own lunch he collected the rents and fixed the apartments i know so i always helped him and we did a good job he cant make you do all the work he has to do his share
4231133 i know bo thats the way its always been but now grandpa has it in his mind that hes old and tired of course he isnt any more tired than he was two days ago hes not a full year older just a matter of hours and he can do almost everything hes ever done around here but this is the way of the men from the woods family they call it quits at 80 thats their tradition and grandpa doesnt believe in breaking traditions
4231134 well its a stupid tradition and im never going to marry a woods boy
4231135 bo id heard whispers before i wedded smulling but i thought the cousins were trying to scare me into calling off the wedding actually they were but i was in love and refused to believe them and im still in love with your grandfather this is his decision and ill do the best i can to deal with it after all a little hard work wont hurt a williams girl even when she turns 90
4231136 stupid stupid stupid i cant believe youre letting him get by with this
4231137 dad grandpa always pulls that cord then he turns the mower on
4231138 pearl youll need to hire a handyman to take care of this house i work 60 hours a week and then im expected to come home to all of smullings work i cant do it and i wont do it why dont you talk some sense into that geezer of yours

4231173 i dont know pa no one will tell me if i did or i didnt the hillbilly on the transistor said drink mountain dew itll tickle your innards i want to know what mountain dew tastes like
4231174 smulling you need to keep on top of these new fangled things
4231175 sorry bo mountain dews a new soda pop ive seen the boys drink it at the station though cant say ive ever tasted the stuff looks green seems popular enough
4231176 whats with the hillbillies then i thought bo was asking about moonshine
4231177 smulling i do believe moonshine and hillbillies were a part of your generation not bos my girl wants some green soda water and it doesnt take hillbillies to brew that its just a foolish commercial shes listened to
4231178 well if its for green soda water cant be good for her she should drink milk just like i did when i was her age
4231179 dale those clothes are filthy ive got them soaking in lye
4231180 pearl i could do that washing draggin my clothes down those steps isnt good for you

4231193 ill let him tickle my outsides and mountain dew can tickle my insides
4231194 my pleasure bo all my pleasure once in awhile a gals just gotta have fun
4231195 smartlink greene turtle and hobbit are also teams that will be in strong contention for the championship this year
4231196 i am trying to bring back the atmosphere the tournament started with which is just trying to give back to the game and the community
4231197 like insert name of sport here but better and faster and higher scoring
4231198 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different
4231199 im not going to play gotcha with one candidate and not with the other this way it will be totally fair you compare apples to apples
4231200 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4231201 im called as a pastor to shepherd all the flock and i have in my church democrats and republicans and liberals and conservatives and moderates and everybody in between
4231202 and my calling is to shepherd all those people so i dont think its appropriate for pastors to endorse
4231203 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4231204 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others

4231340 i think i needed that kick in the pants from somebody of gregs stature who is very funny and done very well on the show to get me to wake up and understand that it was worth trying a pair of zubaz and a wig later its kind of taken off its been a lot of fun

4231346 i learned of the genocide in darfur about the same time i was thinking of setting up a summer festival last year
4231347 i decided that if i set up a summer festival i might as well make it beneficial in some way and giving the donations to darfur in some way became the obvious choice
4231348 i dont know if my reasoning is right or wrong but i believe if people pay less at the door they are more willing to donate their money
4231349 im grateful that the bands i got signed on are willing to play for free
4231350 financially im hoping we make over 1 000 in donations

4231354 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well a lot of times when other things havent worked people find apple cider vinegar does and it can be taken indefinitely

4231393 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4231394 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4231395 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4231396 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4231397 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4231398 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4231399 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4231400 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4231406 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4231407 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4231420 these failures of science online are all examples where scientists show a surprising reluctance to share knowledge that could be useful to others this is ironic for the value of cultural openness was understood centuries ago by many of the founders of modern science indeed the journal system is perhaps the most open system for the transmission of knowledge that could be built with 17th century media we should aim to create an open scientific culture where as much information as possible is moved out of peoples heads and labs onto the network and into tools which can help us structure and filter the information this means everything data scientific opinions questions ideas folk knowledge workflows and everything else the works information not on the network cant do any good ideally well achieve a kind of extreme openness

4231422 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4231423 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4231424 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4231425 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4231426 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4231427 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4231428 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4231429 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4231430 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4231431 who are open to doing something on the production side
4231432 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4231433 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4231434 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4231435 the science of imaginary solutions which symbolically attributes the properties of objects described by their virtuality to their lineaments
4231436 lay their cards on the table then pick them up and start building a house of cards
4231437 unlocking the door of that house of cards picking up the mail from the mat as they walk in
4231438 s e x the all you need to know progressive sexuality guide to get you through high school and college
4231439 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4231440 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4231441 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4231442 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4231443 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4231444 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4231445 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4231446 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4231447 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4231448 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4231449 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4231450 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4231451 electrosmog refers to the electromagnetic fields emitted by computers and mobile phones eco village is a term used for small ecologically sustainable communities and
4231452 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4231453 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4231454 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4231455 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4231456 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4231457 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4231458 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4231459 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4231460 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4231461 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4231462 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4231463 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4231464 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4231465 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4231466 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4231467 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4231468 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4231469 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4231470 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4231471 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4231472 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4231473 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4231474 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4231475 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4231476 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4231477 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4231478 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4231479 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4231480 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4231481 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4231482 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4231483 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4231484 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4231485 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4231486 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4231487 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4231488 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4231489 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4231490 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4231491 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4231492 if we were to more strongly pool the strengths in germany of the existing know how in battery management and energy management in the medium term we could definitely also take a leading position in the field of rechargeable batteries similar to that in todays solar technology the required technical knowledge for this is already available
4231493 in the past eight years incredible progress has been made in cells and rechargeable battery technology as well as in the field of power electronics in the meantime lithium ion rechargeable batteries have achieved an energy density and a power density that not too long ago was considered unthinkable and also nowadays the energy management can be controlled much more accurately therefore we are confident that our project will lead to tangible commercially usable results
4231494 we anticipate that more powerful energy storage in combination with an efficient energy management system will significantly widen the range of applications for lift trucks in the industry
4231495 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4231496 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4231497 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4231498 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4231499 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4231500 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4231501 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4231502 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4231503 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4231504 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4231505 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4231506 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4231507 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4231508 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4231509 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4231510 were just trying to see the situation on the ground
4231511 we need to take some bold transformative steps we need to find some potential areas to invest and see some long term dividends
4231512 we need almost a new deal type investment in alternative resources
4231513 honey ive been here for 85 years i would never leave
4231514 i see where the hope and potential is you have a system in place here
4231515 the problems that used to be associated with places like detroit or toledo are now felt across the board
4231516 in my youth there was total control of most media i e including pr the big three networks the
4231517 but how many iphones burned up talk about a hot item
4231518 as a professional who has walked both sides of pr and journalism i think arringtons advice is
4231519 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4231520 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4231521 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4231522 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4231523 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4231524 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4231525 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4231526 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4231527 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4231528 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration i strongly suspect that scheunemann told saakashvili that the us would back his play
4231529 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4231530 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4231531 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4231532 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4231533 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4231534 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4231535 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4231536 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4231537 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4231538 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4231539 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4231540 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4231541 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4231542 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4231543 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4231544 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4231545 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4231546 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4231547 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4231548 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4231549 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4231550 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4231551 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4231552 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4231553 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4231554 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4231555 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4231556 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4231557 proponents ot prop 8 genuinely endorse the existing civil unions
4231558 removing the right of children to be raised by both of their natural parents
4231559 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4231560 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4231561 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4231562 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4231563 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4231564 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4231565 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4231566 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4231567 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4231568 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4231569 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4231570 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4231571 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4231572 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4231573 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4231574 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4231575 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4231576 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4231577 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4231578 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4231579 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4231580 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4231581 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4231582 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4231583 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4231584 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4231585 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4231586 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4231587 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4231588 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4231589 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4231590 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4231591 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4231592 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4231593 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4231594 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4231595 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4231596 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4231597 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4231598 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4231599 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4231600 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4231601 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4231602 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4231603 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4231604 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4231605 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4231606 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4231607 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4231608 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4231609 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4231610 who will be the next president of the united states
4231611 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4231612 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4231613 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4231614 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4231615 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4231616 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4231617 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4231618 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4231619 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4231620 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4231621 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4231622 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4231623 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4231624 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4231625 morebrainsthanineed you called my name what is it you want
4231626 we all have a right to our own opinion including todd
4231627 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4231628 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4231629 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4231630 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4231631 yes i am saying and it is true that georgia had the legal and morally justifiable right to use force and launch attacks to preserve their union
4231632 seems like president bush has more on the ball environmentally speaking than al gore does
4231633 and that is why democrats cannot seem to connect with joe q public
4231634 in the here and now in the eyes of joe q public the gop is better suited to lead
4231635 the fear mongering human caused global warming hysterics would have everyone believe that any global warming is bad they conveniently ignore all the actual benefits that a little warming would bring
4231636 and yet if edwards was a republican the left blogosphere would be all over it like white on rice
4231637 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4231638 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4231639 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4231640 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4231641 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4231642 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4231643 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4231644 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4231645 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4231646 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4231647 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4231648 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4231649 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do

4231651 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4231652 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4231653 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4231654 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4231655 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4231656 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4231657 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4231658 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4231659 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4231660 just so you all know we did set a record
4231661 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4231662 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4231663 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4231664 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4231665 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4231666 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4231667 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4231668 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4231669 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4231670 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4231671 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4231672 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4231673 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4231674 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4231675 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4231676 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4231677 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4231678 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4231679 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4231680 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4231681 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4231682 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4231683 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4231684 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4231685 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4231686 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4231687 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4231688 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4231689 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4231690 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4231691 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4231692 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4231693 its going to be a whos who of the convention
4231694 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4231695 you have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primaries and that concerns me
4231696 are you afraid im going to register as a communist
4231697 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4231698 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4231699 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4231700 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4231701 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4231702 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4231703 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4231704 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4231705 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4231706 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4231707 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4231708 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4231709 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4231710 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4231711 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4231712 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4231713 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4231714 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4231715 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4231716 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4231717 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4231718 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4231719 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4231720 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4231721 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4231722 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4231723 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4231724 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4231725 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4231726 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4231727 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4231728 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4231729 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4231730 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4231731 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4231732 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4231733 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4231734 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4231735 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4231736 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4231737 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4231738 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4231739 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4231740 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4231741 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4231742 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4231743 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4231744 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4231745 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4231746 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4231747 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4231748 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4231749 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4231750 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4231751 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4231752 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4231753 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4231754 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4231755 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4231756 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4231757 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4231758 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4231759 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4231760 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4231761 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4231762 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4231763 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4231764 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4231765 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4231766 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4231767 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4231768 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4231769 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4231770 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4231771 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4231772 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4231773 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
4231774 i am absolutely crazy about gretta and together she and i want every woman to achieve her perfect signature look
4231775 it takes hard work and commitment to look good but it should also be fun our hope is that well inspire women everywhere to put their best foot forward and with cute shoes too
4231776 for years ive been styling a range of clients from real women to red carpet celebrities both on and off camera and in my experience i have never encountered a show like this which proves style is not superficial
4231777 guide to style is about complete transformations from the inside out it requires hard work total honesty and 100 commitment from the participants throughout the entire makeover process
4231778 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4231779 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4231780 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4231781 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4231782 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4231783 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4231784 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4231785 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4231786 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4231787 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4231788 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4231789 host plants of polyphemus caterpillars include many trees and shrubs such as oaks maples pines birches american hornbeam hawthorns american beech ash witch hazel black walnut yellow poplar black cherry quaking aspen elderberry alders sassafras blueberries grapes willows hickories elms chestnuts and american sycamore
4231790 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4231791 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4231792 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4231793 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4231794 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4231795 you know what if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with the disaster to deal with it so shut up

4231797 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4231798 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4231799 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4231800 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4231801 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4231802 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

4231812 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4231813 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4231814 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4231815 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4231816 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4231817 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4231818 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4231819 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4231820 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4231821 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4231822 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4231823 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4231824 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions

4231826 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer

4231828 ultimately what you are looking for is does this compound do damage to cells
4231829 so could we in fact instead of looking at a whole animal as our first line of analysis look at individual cells from different organisms of different animals with different concentrations of the compound
4231830 although that animal testing approach has given us valuable information it is clearly quite expensive and time consuming it uses animals in large numbers and it doesnt always predict which chemicals will be harmful to humans

4231843 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4231844 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4231845 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4231846 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4231847 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4231848 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4231849 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4231850 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4231851 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4231852 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4231853 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4231854 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4231855 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4231856 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4231857 the economy is screwed we spend too much money and our foreign policy is insane
4231858 true love will find you in the end youll find out just who was your friend dont be sad i know you will dont give up until true love finds you in the end

4231860 ive had a good old grumble about the price of playtv so i should be happy right
4231861 no talks formal or informal have been held between the two parties at any level after the trust vote in parliament
4231862 we do not know their outlook and cannot comment on what they have said through the press unless formal talks take place
4231863 there is no question of any setback when no serious discussions were ever made for firming a third front or having a poll alliance with the bsp
4231864 leaders of various political parties did have a breakfast meeting on july 23 but we just had breakfast together and nothing regarding the formation a front was discussed there
4231865 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4231866 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying

4231881 its always nice to get one early in a tournament
4231882 i only slept two hours so it was tough to get up early in the morning
4231883 but im very pleased it was tough out there today with the wind
4231884 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it
4231885 people and their governments resistance and their demanding their rights will bear fruit
4231886 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
4231887 although turkey doesnt like the present regime it has always tried to keep iranians both at bay and collaborate with them it is an extremely delicate balancing act and it will continue to be so
4231888 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
4231889 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the united nations security council but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
4231890 the position of the united states is well known they do not want for the time being any military action against iran
4231891 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
4231892 when you are under u n chapter seven resolutions when you are having trouble getting banks to come in getting investment when export credits are going down from around the world when you have inflation roaring
4231893 the government has become a major employer causing a lot of economic problems for the country
4231894 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
4231895 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step
4231896 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay
4231897 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre
4231898 its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4231899 if youre a woman working in the public service youre better off working in an agency where the majority of employees are men and youre better off working in a larger agency because it seems to dictate the pay levels
4231900 its not about work value its about the size of the agency and whether your agency has the capacity to pay fair wage increases or not
4231901 are likely to pay a heavy price because of politicians beating up on big oil
4231902 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4231903 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35m people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honour and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4231904 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4231905 the obama campaign has made no significant headway among former clinton backers over the past two months the voting preferences of clintons supporters are virtually identical to earlier polls in june and july

4231916 un enfoque tradicional tambi n fracasado de la polarizaci n gobierno y oposici n en donde solamente nos ocupemos de la pol tica y descalificar la propuesta del gobierno y polarizar yo creo que ese enfoque nos podr llevar al fracaso

4232230 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4232231 the dragline is the most cost efficient piece of equipment we use on our surface mines in alabama
4232232 when it was taken out of service the company was forced to utilize more truck and loader equipment spreads in applications that are typically more appropriate for dragline operations
4232233 the write down reflects current market realities but our belief in the long term growth and strategic value of the chipidea analog business remains strong
4232234 certainly took a lot longer than they first talked about and a lot longer than i think many investors wouldve expected
4232235 that being said the credit markets probably played a role we dont know the breakdown of equity versus debt to finance the deal but im assuming that probably played a role in terms of how long the plan took to put it together

4232242 the territorial integrity of georgia has been dealt an irreparable blow by georgia itself
4232243 neither iran nor venezuela nor uzbekistan nor even belorussia said a word in support of russia
4232244 the level of manipulation of public opinion and also the speed with which society has been reduced to mass hysteria are indisputable achievements of the regime and represent an indisputable and unprecedented threat to russian society
4232245 under the volleys of grad missiles and explosions of aviation bombs the problem that so tormented him putin and the entire political elite the problem of a third which is to say life long presidential term has been organically resolved
4232246 the gatherer of the russian lands has a long mission one paved with the best intentions no one will even think of limiting it by any artificial pseudo constitutional time frames this is the most important domestic result of his second short victorious war
4232247 let us confess that even on the morning of august 12 a further escalation of the conflict with georgia looked inevitable
4232248 the continued bombardment of the territory of this still independent republic the appearance of our military units at the approaches to poti the georgian port city the naming of general vladimir shamanov the hard line former commander of russian forces in chechnya as gauleiter of abkhazia with the obvious prospect of him becoming the governor general of all of georgia the unprecedented aggressive rhetoric of officials including representatives of the diplomatic corps all of this pointed to the determination of the russian leadership to see the affair to its logical end that is the removal of mikhail saakashvilis regime and suddenly there was dmitry medvedevs sensational announcement
4232249 today one can speak of serious disagreements between the president and the premier over the further development of events in the caucasus the president from the start did not plan to go beyond the bounds of the peacekeeping mission in south ossetia and at a certain point they began to talk to him about the logic of war and the unexpected appearance of the possibility to resolve important geopolitical tasks he in turn pointed to the lack of preparedness of the military operation the large losses and the severe foreign policy consequences today one can note with satisfaction that the presidents point of view prevailed and he was able to insist on a positive solution
4232250 welcomed that historical decision of the georgian people and government about leaving the cis we support georgias direction toward the rule of law where civil rights and freedoms are valued we hope that kyrgyzstan will follow georgias example in the central asian context and become a truly legal independent and democratic state
4232251 turkey is a very large country and has a large population there are a lot of places in turkey of course that means that there are many places for the president to go to
4232252 i consider these discussions about the details of the visit irrelevant

4232254 a man the other day pointed out that i was never bored i hadnt thought of that before but its true im never bored im appalled horrified angered but never bored the world appears to me so infinite in its variety that many lifetimes could not exhaust its interest so long as you can still be surprised you have something to be thankful for
4232255 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread
4232256 empirically we know that people with histories of ear infections do gain weight
4232257 empirically we know that they rate high fat high sweet foods as more pleasant are those two connected is it the increased pleasantness that makes them eat more and makes them gain weight
4232258 thats what we want to find out it looks like it is
4232259 this isnt in all kids its a small proportion of kids and you probably have to have a fair number of ear infections
4232260 but i think its something thats very interesting based on the epidemic in obesity that we seem to be experiencing in our country even among very young children
4232261 we have an obesity problem in this country part of it could be genetic differences between people but the reality is our genetics havent changed that much in the last 100 years
4232262 that implies a large part of the obesity problem has to be from our environment i think this is one small piece from the environmental puzzle people who have a history of a lot of ear infections may be at higher risk for future obesity through the foods they choose to eat
4232263 cheap ready access to these very energy dense foods that are highly palatable
4232264 its so easy to go to mcdonalds and spend 5 to get a very energy dense meal that tastes very good

4232267 the department has reviewed the recent federal intelligence surveillance act amendments as well as the various discovery responses from at amp t to date and has reluctantly concluded that the amendments passed by congress and signed into law by president bush appear to preclude further investigations into the activities which initially gave rise to this proceeding
4232268 the fisa amendments act of 2008 bars us from investigating any alleged provision of customer information by the carriers to the national security agency or other elements of the intelligence community from requiring the disclosure of any information about such alleged activities or from imposing any sanction for such activities
4232269 if all companies were to act as at amp t did in this matter the dps would be required to petition the board every time it issued requests resulting in a substantial waste of board and department resources and significant delays in the departments ability to assess whether or not companies are acting in compliance with vermont law
4232270 we believe the board is correct in noting continuing privacy concerns of vermont customers
4232271 the ability of this board and or the department of public service to protect customers has been radically limited
4232272 theres clearly a considerable amount of negative sentiment swirling around the warehouse leasing market at this time
4232273 this is hampering any significant forward movement for the industrial sector
4232274 that said the export sector remains a bright spot showing its not all doom and gloom for industrial

4232277 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
4232278 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
4232279 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal

4232293 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4232294 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4232296 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4232304 the fact is todays affluent consumer is less likely to give a new brand a chance
4232305 it is in tough times like these where marketers are rewarded for their investment in brand loyalty programs a brand loyal customer is one who buys your brand more frequently and spends more when they do
4232306 over three quarters of all luxury consumers are members of at least one loyalty program so these programs have a powerful appeal to affluents what luxury brands and retailers need to learn are the key attributes of their brand as viewed by their customers so that they can design their loyalty program to appeal to their unique customer base
4232307 with the michigan economy already on the skids as gas prices went up we saw our prospects dwindle
4232308 we couldnt move the store to another part of the country so we needed to come up with some way to get people back in the showroom
4232309 we tried several other promotions reduced prices on furniture extended payments but nothing seems to work like the free gas

4232320 to clear the space of bad spirits and bring in the good ones but it was meaningful and earnest
4232321 its just the logical continuation of the always being connected generation we have now where everybody is tied to a wireless umbilical cord and knows exactly where everybody is who is close and dear to their hearts

4232361 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4232362 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4232363 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4232364 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end

4232369 weve had a legacy of having really fast cars i think of having generally pretty good engines and better than average luck there
4232370 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want
4232371 you can go two and three wide on that downforce racetrack for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
4232372 to run two feet off the wall at michigan is id like to say a dangerous line because one little mistake and it wipes the right side of the car off
4232373 greg should certainly be ok given the mix of races weve got left
4232374 but man weve got to miss the wreck and we cant have a part that breaks who gets in will be more determined by things gone wrong than it will by blinding speed

4232396 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4232397 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4232398 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4232399 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4232400 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4232401 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me

4232437 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
4232438 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

4232468 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4232469 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing

4232479 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4232480 we traveled for two and a half months from the top of the continent to the bottom norway to athens to morocco and points in between

4232483 the majority of my clients always want to do the art cities
4232484 when i get them back again then i can propose other places
4232485 you can look for things that are off the radar and off the beaten track
4232486 but a lot of it is just finding hidden gems and less familiar sights in those cities that people are used to going to

4232495 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4232496 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4232497 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup

4232508 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4232509 its just tragic thats all i can say about it
4232510 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

4232516 it would be easy to think that there are two kinds of people in this gathering the secure and the insecure

4232520 the point and distrac t from the real issue the persistent health disparities faced by women and men in the african american community
4232521 no need to resort to far flung conspiracy theories to explain the higher abortion rate among black women
4232522 those professing concern for the well being of african american women have an obligation to put the issue of abortion in its proper context and to support evidence based policies that would have a positive impact
4232523 number of specific steps policymakers can take right now that could dramatically improve the sexual and reproductive health of african americans and americans in general
4232524 my challenge to antiabortion activists is to stop throwing around inflammatory terms like genocide and instead channel their considerable energies and resources into supporting policies that reduce the need for abortion lets get serious about helping women and their families including women in the african american community
4232525 we have no motivation to low ball because wed just end up in a budget mess
4232526 cuts in programs would have to be considerably above 1 billion to meet patersons state savings figure
4232527 we have got to stop this frenzy about spending and lack of accountability
4232528 we need from the legislature real and reoccurring cuts we need a sense of understanding of how serious this problem can get
4232529 wir haben beim thema raketenschild eine einigung mit den usa erzielt
4232530 weve got nothing against gx2s and recently we just had another gx2 with the 9800 gx2 it has its advantages and disadvantages and so i dont know that theres any particular philosophical approach that we take here we just have to look at the market and build the right product
4232531 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4232532 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4232533 probably the biggest mistake is looking for something familiar for us the whole point of traveling is to experience the place we are and that means eating the food people there eat the way they eat it that could range from indian pudding in a maine diner to carnitas tacos from a truck in south tucson in other words be adventurous try new things meet new people
4232534 compared to last year tennessee continues to see job losses in manufacturing professional business services and financial activities employment
4232535 at the same time we are experiencing year to year gains in educational and health services employment and in local government educational services

4232537 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4232538 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4232543 i want to get back on track and get back to where i was before the injury i m going to be fighting marcus hicks on september 20 in the ecc before i come back to the mfc but i m looking forward to defending my title against anyone they put in front of me i have a great relationship with the mfc i get along really well with mark pavelich they have a great organization and i was really excited to sign a new deal with them a potential opponent for hollett in his mfc return bout could be former ufc light heavyweight contender david heath who signed a multi fight deal with the organization last month while heath has voiced his desire to fight hollett as soon as possible pavelich points out that heath could end up fighting a fellow contender for a shot at hollett in the form of a possible future signing we re looking at adding another marquee fighter to the division who we may have fight heath on september 26 to see which of the two will face roger in november
4232544 let s just say it will surprise a lot of people if we sign this guy clark a veteran of the early days of the ufc is currently riding a three fight winning streak hes recently been fighting exclusively out of the courage fighting championships where he last scored a first round tko of matt kelly in june clarks mfc debut wont be an easy one as the promotion has already matched up him against rising welterweight prospect ryan ford at mfc 18 famous on september 26th call me experienced don t call me a veteran
4232545 when people call someone a veteran it means they re old and at the end of their career
4232546 most vulnerable low income children are covered first without moving them from private to public coverage
4232547 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty
4232548 after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4232549 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines of what president bush proposed

4232560 we have long been painfully exercised in relation to the existence of slavery among the churches of our faith in the southern part of our country
4232561 you cant assume that every congregation just because they are from the north agreed or disagreed
4232562 many of our numbers have been embarrassed by the association with slaveholders
4232563 i am so proud that they were social justice advocates then
4232564 they moved into the first floor of that building in 1859 the following year they started into phase two

4232572 hey look at my old pants see how big they are in comparison to my newer slimmer pants im thinner
4232573 i was having a conversation with one of the veteran players the other day
4232574 and he was telling me coach you cant underestimate what a difference it means to me to have played in games
4232575 you can get all the practice turns that there are
4232576 but once a player has been in the game and done it in those circumstances the players got confidence hes got more poise hes got better presence on the field its probably all intertwined
4232577 i talked to a couple of other guys about it and i asked hey how did this apply to your circumstances and they were all the same way you cant underestimate what a difference it makes
4232578 obviously zak being a fifth year player having been in games we would certainly hope that that would be the case in his circumstances
4232579 were not making any accommodations to the fact that the linebackers are veterans
4232580 one of the things that we believe in is that you build on your strengths and theyre a strength of our team
4232581 if we look to another area and we havent paid proper diligence to our strength then all of a sudden our strength isnt a strength anymore
4232582 those players who have shown that they should be our most productive players were going to make sure that we do everything to make sure that we get those guys on top of their games

4232594 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4232595 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease

4232602 we believe that utilisation of a software based access management solution can be used to properly secure all physical and virtual machines without having to reconfigure the physical network for security
4232603 designed to secure both physical and virtual environments through a single management window such a solution helps security administrators rapidly implement policies software based access management is helping organisations protect their critical business assets and enabling them to focus key staff on strategic projects
4232604 if you layer thousands of security rules and access control lists over hundreds of internal firewalls and vlans it s easy to imagine the maintenance challenges organisations face
4232605 and if you add the fact that firewalls and vlans are static in nature and one of the premises of server virtualisation is migration the management challenges are compounded
4232606 what can we conclude from this data it seems as though the general e learning practitioner is getting smarter and more specific about what he or she does theyre defining e learning in narrower terms to cover the actual learning experiences i e virtual classrooms simulations e courseware rather than the infrastructure systems that their organizations use to develop and support e learning i e lms lcms authoring tools in addition an increasing number of employees and managers are not only aware of e learning but also are interested in using it more important even though technology and cost issues ranked as their highest concerns managers are conscious of the culture issues involved in implementing a successful e learning strategy finally e learning developers are increasing their personal skill levels which hopefully will raise the quality of future online programs
4232607 it can be said flatly that the mere act of listening to wise statements and sound advice does little for anyone in the process of learning the learners dynamic cooperation is required
4232608 thinking out original answers to new problems or giving new interpretations to old problems is assumed in much undergraduate instruction to be an adult function as as such one properly denied to students the task of the student commonly taken to be one chiefly of familiarizing himself with accepted thoughts and accepted techniques these to be actively used some later time the instruction period in other words often is regarded both by students and teachers as a time for absorption
4232609 the business school must be able to do more for its students than could be accomplished in a corresponding period of actual business experience
4232610 yet no amount of information whether of theory or fact in itself improves insight and judgment or increases ability to act wisely under conditions of responsibility
4232611 investing in employee learning continues to be a priority for business leaders
4232612 organizations are linking learning to performance and the bottom line and they understand the relationship between creating a skilled workforce and achieving enterprise wide success
4232613 workforce development is critical for organizational success and business leaders must take stock of their employee learning programs and measure them against best practices in leading organizations
4232614 we hope that organizations will take employee learning day and more days in the future to celebrate the growth of their employees knowledge and skills as a prime contributor to competitive advantage

4232618 based on anecdotal accounts in our discussions with online brokerages both the number of attacks and dollar volume of losses has grown over the past two years

4232651 audio learning is nothing new but thanks to mp3 players we have new channels for delivery and its encouraging to see that over half of our survey group are tapping into those channels informal and mobile learning will be hot topics in 2006 and audio learning is at the intersection of both
4232652 weve reached the point where audio learning must be part of what we consider in our learning solutions its easy to create gives experts a real voice and is informal and disposable but we have to do two things design it properly short modular clips not 30 minute monologues and make access easier nearly 40 of survey respondents believe they dont have the right technology to access audio

4232664 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4232665 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia

4232677 the governors budget proposal to bail out subprime lenders with huge tax breaks is outrageous
4232678 irresponsible subprime lending during the mortgage boom hurt millions of families and sent the economy on a downward spiral resulting in budget deficits across state and local governments we should not be rewarding and enabling bad behavior by bailing out subprime lenders with large tax breaks
4232679 our top priorities are to protect education preserve health care and the environment and maintain public safety bailing out subprime lenders should be nowhere on that priority list even in the best of times there are a million other more worthy causes than helping subprime lenders now in bad times when the governor is laying off state workers giving corporate welfare to subprime lenders is not just morally wrong it is idiotic

4232696 they had a couple of commercials on television saying swish is back
4232697 its going to be awesome im excited to go back and see a lot of people i really enjoyed my time there
4232698 in that situation i guess i thought differently than they did
4232699 but coming over here and playing for a first place team i dont think you could ask for anything more
4232700 oakland general manager billy beane knows what hes doing they have their new ballpark coming up and i think they are getting ready for that move
4232701 i could not be happier with the situation ive been put in over here in chicago
4232702 not only the team and the owners but the fans have been absolutely great
4232703 going back to the place where i started i think it will be good im really excited
4232704 i did a lot of great things out there and i think the reception will be great i really do
4232705 if i get a big hit then they might boo me
4232706 you wouldnt see the yankees or red sox doing that
4232707 thats when the attention shifts to them the kids thats where it should be
4232708 were basically in little league heaven on earth right here
4232709 it kind of makes other things inconsequential even going to an all star game shes our priority no 1
4232710 they put her in my arms right away after she was born she opened her eyes looked right at me i looked at her thinking i made you
4232711 i was there for two days and had to leave to come to new york i wanted to stay i didnt want to leave
4232712 she supported me through thick and thin she was always there to take me to baseball games tournaments my whole life she did everything she could for me
4232713 when my parents split up my dad moved away it was me and my mom and sister ive got to give my dad credit he did what he could he came to the all star game and so did my mom sister an uncle
4232714 if i get the w kudos to me if we win and i dont get the w i feel the same way
4232715 but keeping my team in games is my job and were two away from 20
4232716 i think joes become really comfortable with what he needs to do to get hitters out
4232717 hes not afraid of contact and hes got a good arm which is the start of everything
4232718 i think in the winter there was some competition that was kind of building when we traded for jon garland to get some depth in our rotation but once we got into the spring it was clear the guys we felt we were going to line up and joe was always one of them
4232719 joe went about his business the right way and worked hard
4232720 its great to see his hard work appreciated and rewarded
4232721 my arm was killing me i just had to keep working and being patient
4232722 if someone said they never doubted he would return im sure they are probably not being honest
4232723 any kind of major surgery there is some kind of doubt
4232724 i wasnt ready at all i was trying to do too much too soon i wasnt feeling good at all
4232725 my arm was hurting a little bit i didnt tell anybody
4232726 that was pretty fun i was getting my confidence back it felt like 06
4232727 he needed to go down there and learn all the parts of pitching
4232728 how do you deal with adversity holding runners making adjustments so many factors go into it that he needed to get back to the only way he was going to do that was pitch a lot of innings in the minors the more he threw the better he got the better he got the more confidence he grew
4232729 in 06 i was throwing harder everything was harder my slider was harder my fastball was harder
4232730 i went out there and just threw the slider all the time now i mix up my pitches throw the changeup fastball slider now i am more of a pitcher than before not just throwing
4232731 hes a lot more confident right now hes still not 100 percent to where he was in 06 but hes confident to where he knows he can get batters out
4232732 i think he was a little confused in april you have a terrible injury like he did and you return thinking you will have the same stuff you had in 06 he just wasnt the same injuries like that it takes time to come back you never know if you are going to be that same player you were before you got injured sometimes it takes a lot of guts to come back and try to be what you were before
4232733 i didnt put my head down i just kept working all the way through
4232734 because of issues that have arisen during the course of this project all of which are unrelated to the city
4232735 regardless of whether mpk or the city controls the project
4232736 i simply want to assure you that all necessary infrastructure will be completed for opening day of spring training in february 2009
4232737 passing a guy like bob brenly is obviously an honor for me
4232738 bob has been a part of many memorable wins for the diamondbacks hes done a great job molding different types of rosters into winning clubs
4232739 being from the previous regime and coming in when i did during the turnover i appreciate that josh evaluated me for what i do and just didnt bring somebody else in just to bring somebody else in
4232740 i was fortunate that the general manager stuck with me
4232741 at least now i know we have a good forestry division
4232742 theres a lot of work going on right now my concerns are the same every game i watch theres bats splintering im sensitive about it
4232743 to make the changes in the bats the manufacturers would need a significant amount of lead time im told
4232744 ive talked to hall of famers hank aaron willie mays rod carew they talk about the bat handles and everything else everybody has a different theory on it
4232745 and we had actually because everything we did worked but we may also put an additional safeguard in
4232746 im seeing the ball well and im focusing on that
4232747 it sounds kind of cliche but its true when you can keep it that simple you kind of allow yourself to play kind of get out of your own way
4232748 its simple notice the difference in at bats recognizing pitches and taking pitches that i shouldnt be swinging at and swinging at pitches that are hittable and its as simple as that now you put that together over a longer period of time and good things happen so if i had to pick one thing its the fact ive been focusing on that and only that
4232749 in reality to do well it actually takes less instead of more but human nature and my nature is to try harder when in reality it doesnt have anything to do with it its about keeping it simple and when im at my best thats what i do
4232750 everybodys giving me a hard time because that ball i hit down the line everyone thought might have been fair
4232751 but it was foul it was foul for christmas ill probably just give him a big box of chalk
4232752 its going to be a rough thanksgiving this year at their house
4232753 i havent given next year a great deal of thought
4232754 i would prefer not to go out this way but if that ends up being the case those things happen there are a lot of uncertainties here right now and one of the things i believe real strong in is that if new people come in aside from anyone that knows anything about me they should bring their own people with them especially their pitching coach i have always been a believer in that
4232755 i still enjoy my work and have the burn inside me
4232756 i need that to do a good job this would be a tough ending especially since we had such high expectations and havent approached them at all
4232757 its not as bad as it was though so thats good
4232758 i couldnt swallow hardly at all so i couldnt eat or drink much fluids
4232759 i was tired and just laying around and kept falling asleep most of the day
4232760 i think he just finally put some food in him and were going to try to get him out doing some baseball related activity
4232761 swing the bat in the cage ride the bike and jog a little bit and see how he goes from there
4232762 it was unfortunate that it happened but you just deal with it and go forward
4232763 but of course thats what im shooting for it could be days its just going to be a matter of what i can tolerate with movement and how mobile im going to be out on the mound
4232764 i was going to back up home and i went to turn
4232765 i dont know if my spike caught or if i caught the lip of the baseline or what i went to turn caught popped it and rolled it pretty good from there it was kind of a blur
4232766 were going to wait and see what happens in the next few days if its ok then we dont have to dl him if its not then we have to think about doing that
4232767 were just going to see if we can get by with what we have right now because if he can come back in five days its better than putting him on the dl and losing him that long we just have to hope that our pitchers can give us seven or eight innings
4232768 to go on the dl for something like that is something youre not wanting to do hopefully its not going to come down to that but it would be about as disappointing as an end of the season could be
4232769 it has been a frustrating year for all of them
4232770 we have come up short of the expectations we had in spring training but there have been some positive things happen as well
4232771 obviously at this point of the season we realize there is nowhere to go
4232772 but there still are some things we can play for i want to get everybody in a good frame of mind as the season draws to a close so they can feel good about themselves going into next year i think thats important for all my pitchers
4232773 i like what i have seen of rowland smith as a starter
4232774 he needs to continue working on fastball locations but his curveball is very good and his changeup is good too hes left handed and hes someone we could look forward to as a regular in the rotation as early as next season
4232775 were all anxious for morrow to serve his apprenticeship you might say and get enough pitches down there in the minor leagues to come up here and start around the first of september
4232776 what i would like to see with him is he is to become capable of taking a starting position being counted on to pitch every five days and to pitch with the strength he had coming out of the bullpen
4232777 he has the pitches to be a starter but he needs to get his feet wet and hopefully get his pitch count up to where he can pitch into the second half of a game which is very important he needs to go five or six innings and still have good arm strength at end of the session
4232778 i think even with a pitcher of his experience jarrod has learned a lot about himself over the course of the year other than a game or two out of the last 10 or 12 starts he has really pitched well and given us a chance to win and that basically is the job of a starting pitcher his offspeed pitches and his sinker have gotten better unfortunately he hasnt had the privilege of much run support
4232779 he has about six starts left and i expect him to finish strong hes starting to throw the ball right now as well as he was earlier in the season prior to the injury he had there at home plate at shea stadium on june 23 his arm has stayed pretty sound all year which is a real plus but hes had a couple of other things hes had to battle he had problems with a calf and that left ankle has been kind of hanging on it has gotten better but the majority of the games recently when weve had to remove him from a game its partly because of pitch count but just as much because of a tired ankle
4232780 obviously at this point of the season we realize there is nowhere to go but there still are some things we can play for i want to get everybody in a good frame of mind as the season draws to a close so they can feel good about themselves going into next year i think thats important for all my pitchers
4232781 he has had a tough year hes had some games where he pitched really well and we didnt play well behind him hes a contact guy and we have to play well behind him for him to have success he started out so well 3 0 in april that i really thought that this was going to be carlos year
4232782 for some reason or another maybe he felt he had to do something extra he kind of got caught up in that a little bit and more sometimes mean less
4232783 i have tried to make him think more positively i thought for a while he was thinking negatively during the course of the game i know that if you start thinking about negative things they are going to come
4232784 erik pitched well when he was healthy people were real hard on him and i think it was kind of unfair because for a while he was pitching through this shoulder injury his arm didnt feel 100 percent he would simply run out of gas at the 100 pitch level
4232785 people including me wanted him to stay in but we didnt know he was dealing with a weak arm he still basically has that talent and what i really would like to see before the end of the season is for him to make a few starts and see what he can bring us when his arm is at full strength which it will be before he goes back out there whether that happens or not this year remains to be seen but i hope it does
4232786 he had a lot of little physical problems early and never really got on a roll that he had last year when he pitched so well time and time again he won 16 ballgames for this club but this year he never got into a real good stretch that he maintained for any length of time
4232787 we have bounced him back and forth from the rotation to the bullpen and thats never an easy thing for a pitcher hes back in the bullpen now and i dont know how happy he is about that but it has been a tough year for him his problems have been two fold injuries and the number of walks they have been pretty bad and saying that i think i am being pretty complimentary they have been terrible for a pitcher of his experience looking at the number of bases on balls hes had in the past compared to this season has really made a difference in him having the kind of success he wants to have one of the pluses though is he is healthy now and he still throws the ball well of all the injuries none of them dealt with his arm
4232788 omfg what did i think i looked like in those john lennon glasses

4232795 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4232796 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
4232797 we are very happy to be working with pg amp e to help meet californias requirements for clean renewable energy and are committed to working closely with the local community as this project moves forward
4232798 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
4232799 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
4232800 our experience constructing more than 350 megawatts of solar systems on three continents allows us to deliver utility scale systems quickly and at a scale of hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community
4232801 the companys second quarter results demonstrate the continued momentum we are generating in the domestic market as reflected by another quarter of strong domestic sales
4232802 despite a challenging economic environment customers in the united states continue to recognize the value that the prolink system provides as reflected by domestic new system sales growth of 30 this follows a strong 2008 first quarter refinances grew at an impressive 185 continuing to demonstrate our customers commitment to our systems as a key revenue center at the golf course we have begun to work with our new international distributors generating approximately 600 000 in sales outside of the u s market sales during the second quarter and we believe that we will begin to see an increase in international revenue during the second half of the year as our organizations gain more time and momentum working together our cost reduction program launched in mid 2007 has begun to show results with an 18 reduction in operating expenses for the 2008 second quarter which has helped to reduce operating loss by 1 8 million second quarter operating expenses declined to 50 6 of revenue from 75 2 during the 2007 second quarter we continue to seek ways to further reduce costs through operating efficiencies
4232803 while we are pleased by the strength in our domestic operations we continue to focus on several additional areas that have the potential to bring the company to profitability
4232804 we continue to seek new distributors in other international markets that will grow sales and support our customer base in foreign countries we also have in place the people and relationships to drive advertising revenue while we are disappointed the economic downturn has adversely impacted advertisers in several of our key target markets we are still on track with our long term business strategy the migration of media spending to new and more effective digital platforms like prolinks remains intact although growth will not happen in a linear manner we have taken important steps to expand and improve the quality and quantity of our digital network and have created new relationships with new clients this is evidenced by the recent announcement that one of the worlds largest telecommunications companies at amp t has elected to advertise in the prolink network research program as part of a category exclusive three month advertising campaign advertisers like this one are key building blocks of a successful future for our company as new digital mediums like the prolink network becomes an increasingly important part of the media marketplace with interest in these programs high we expect advertising to become an increasingly significant component of revenue in the coming quarters
4232805 this one a long time have i watched all his life has he looked away to the future to the horizon never his mind on where he was what he was doing

4232807 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ring tones they are more likely to call their provider for support
4232808 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact this can potentially increase the number of transfers and the hold times for customers with an increase in hold times providers run the risk of decreasing customer satisfaction and losing customers to other providers as switching levels are 83 percent higher among customers who are put on hold compared with those who are not
4232809 overall customer care performance is three times higher among customers whose issues were resolved in one contact over the phone compared with those who had to contact their provider more than once for the same issue
4232810 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different

4232815 we have made solid progress across all aspects of our business in this last quarter the anrs sponsored study investigating clevudine in combination with viread r in hbv is a very exciting study for us and reflects the potential movement of the marketplace toward combination therapy
4232816 in addition we have made substantial progress in our hcv programs with the recent clinical data from r7128 and our nomination of psi 7851 as a next generation lead product candidate to be advanced into clinical development this progress allows us to maintain a well balanced and growing portfolio of hepatology product candidates
4232817 we look forward to the unblinding of our r7128 genotype 2 3 patient data and hope to see data that is consistent with the antiviral activity we see in genotype 1 patients
4232818 kevin schicks contributions over more than 25 years as an executive have been instrumental to the success and financial integrity of the con way organization

4232822 in addition to continuing the expansion of our installed base of pct systems we have also implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives including the delay of certain research and development projects reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel continued reduction in investor relations activities decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers decrease in annual cash compensation for all outside board members and a reduction in our workforce that included the re alignment of our domestic sales force from seven full time sales directors to three we ended the second quarter with approximately 2 8 million in cash and cash equivalents we believe that this amount of cash together with the cost reduction measures will allow us to reach a manageable balance between the need to conserve our cash resources and the need to support our short term commercialization plans we have also engaged emerging growth equities of king of prussia pa to help us raise additional capital to fund our further development and commercialization of pct
4232823 it has been said that gaining market acceptance for any new cutting edge technology always takes longer and is far more difficult than one would ever expect pct has been no exception although we believe that in many cases pct offers greater safety speed reproducibility convenience and quality than other sample preparation methods it has been difficult thus far to generate the level of interest we believe this technology will ultimately gain however i am pleased to report that interest in pct and the pct sample preparation system has grown steadily over the past two months during this period we have received significantly more requests for product information and on site demonstrations and have added significantly more type a leads to our sales pipeline than during any other comparable two month period since we initiated our commercialization plans in early 2007 this increased interest in our pct product line has already manifested itself in record installations for a quarter and we are not even halfway through august this is certainly an exciting time for all stakeholders in pressure biosciences

4232836 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4232837 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4232838 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4232839 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4232840 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4232841 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere

4232925 so much money was being spent to push the corporate model that it was all cities heard about there was no pr or marketing for community wireless groups but unlike the corporations their focus has always been maximizing the public good
4232926 i firmly believe that every public access tv operation every community radio station every nonprofit community technology center can be doing this
4232927 its not rocket science all of those technology based nonprofits are strapped for revenue weve got to figure out a way to capture some of those digital dollars that are falling out of our communities and this is it

4232930 if a private company decides they just arent going to do it anymore the community is stuck because its privately owned
4232931 if its publicly owned and the network is not going exactly as planned they can decide if its still worth it for their police officers to have access if its still worth it to have inspectors and social workers be able to enter their data remotely if its still worth it for citizens to be able to connect anywhere they can ask those questions and decide whether its good for the community or not

4232935 universal affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007
4232936 we have a failure on the national level thats too important to ignore
4232937 not to view broadband as a strategic asset is a significant shortcoming the other leading countries of the world do view broadband in that light and they are thinking about how to get more of it at much faster speeds and lower rates because its a platform for so many other things that are important
4232938 is make sure that communities that want to solve their own problems that want to build the network they need can do that
4232939 if we open up the unused spaces between the television channels it suddenly becomes possible to deploy the network that we need at a quarter of the cost
4232940 as president i will set a simple goal every american should have the highest speed broadband access no matter where you live or how much money you have well connect schools libraries and hospitals and well take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity
4232941 we need to start looking at this as an infrastructure issue rather than as a business
4232942 we dont ask cities and towns to cost justify bringing in fresh water and having a sewer system when we could outsource it to private companies nobody says why should my town compete with the private water market i can get perrier why should i have water we treat water as a utility we do the same thing with electricity we have to take the same attitude here toward broadband

4232959 the word of god preached now means in this fourth and innermost circle human language about god in which and through which god himself speaks about himself
4232960 cannot touch the fact of this vicariate or succession but only the manner of it
4232961 we ask to what extent can the exercise of such an authority still be regarded as service to god to what extent have we still to deal with a representation here and not rather with a replacement of christ
4232962 is a truly significant attempt to come to terms with the problem of real proclamation
4232963 a personal lordship i e of christ must be a free lordship a personal presence must be such that along with it there is a possibility of absence a personal gift must be faced with the possibility of its refusal and precisely this limitation of church powers by the person of christ must prove the church to be the true church serving christ but it is just this limitation that is excluded by the doctrine of the historical succession of the character indelibilis and of the possibility of infallible definitions therefore we must reject this doctrine
4232964 real proclamation thus means the word of god preached and the word of god preached means in this and outermost circle human language about god on the basis of an indication by god himself fundamentally transcending all human causation and so devoid of all human basis merely occurring as a fact and requiring to be acknowledged
4232965 real proclamation thus means gods word preached and gods word preached means in this circle human language about god on the basis of gods self objectification which is neither present nor predictable nor relatable to any design but is real solely in the freedom of his grace in virtue of which from time to time he wills to be the object of this language and is so according to his own good pleasure
4232966 this criterion we cannot handle it is the criterion which handles itself
4232967 real proclamation therefore means the word of god proclaimed and the word of god proclaimed now means in this inner circle human language about god which according to gods own judgment which cannot be anticipated and never passes into our control is true language and therefore language to be listen to language which rightly demands obedience
4232968 it is the miracle of revelation and of faith when proclamtion to us is not a human volition and execution qualified in some way but also and primarily and decisively gods own act when for us human language about god is not only human language but also and primarily and decisively gods own language
4232969 without depriving the human side of its freedom its earthly substance its humanity without dissolving the human subject or turning its action into a mechanical event god is the subject from whom the human action must acquire its new true name

4232973 the piety which forms the basis of all ecclesiastical communions a modification of feeling or of immediate self consciousness
4232974 fortunately the churches reality does not coinicide exactly with her action
4232975 god in his gracious approach to mortals in revelation and reconciliation
4232976 theology is the question as to the foundation as practical theology it is the question as to the aim as dogmatic theology it is the question as to the content of the language peculiar to the church
4232977 to no question regarding christian language about god that need be put independently and is therefore not to be regarded as an independent theological discipline it is the indispensable auxiliary science to exegetical dogmatic and practical theology
4232978 how can we come to a preliminary understanding as to the path of knowledge to be trodden in dogmatics
4232979 the church and faith are to be understood as part of a larger essential context and dogmatics as part of a large scientific problem context that of an ontology
4232980 as christian so far as it fails to see that such a determination of human reality only proceeds from something outside of all human possibilities i e from god acting
4232981 dogmatic prolegomena consist here in the finding that in the form of holy scripture church tradition and the living teaching apostolate of the church infallibly representing and interpreting both we have the objective principle of knowledge insert pause while in the form of the fides catholica which receives the revelation in what is set before it by the church we have the subjective principle of knowledge
4232982 by renouncing the presupposition of an existential ontological possibility for the essence of the church
4232983 in the present instant in which jesus christ himself speaks and is heard when the light divine is created in our hearts
4232984 it is from the direction of jesus christ as the essence of the church that we may expect free personal decision as to what ought to be the proper content of christian language and so also as to what should be the way to knowledge of it to knowledge of dogma
4232985 the question of formal dogma cannot be raised without at this very central point entering upon material dogma
4232986 as an act of faith in the determination of human action by listening and as obedience towards jesus christ
4232987 by the gracious approach of god to humans the free personal presence of jesus christ in a humans action
4232988 real theology is a determination and claim by god acting which a human really encounters
4232989 the theological habitus on the one hand and the faith or rebirth of the theologian on the other
4232990 no theology is at any moment humanly insured or insurable against the danger of becoming such onlookers wisdom outside the church against the danger of becoming atheology
4232991 dogmatics is possible only as an act of faith when we refer to prayer as the attitude apart from which dogmatic work is impossible
4232992 the self test to which the christian church puts herself in respect of the content of her peculiar language about god
4232993 the intractability of faith and its object should and will see to it that divine certainty cannot become human security
4232994 dogmatics exists only as the theologia crucis theology of the cross that is the act of obedience which is certain in faith but for that very reason humble it is always on the narrow way leading form the revelation that happened to the revelation promised
4232995 the claim with which church proclamation comes forward and the atmosphere of its expectation with which it is surrounded should not mislead us as to the fact that it is always and always will be mans word
4232996 it is also more than that it is also something quite different from that it is namely when and where god pleases gods own word but proclamation alike as preaching and as sacrament does not cease to be representation to be human service
4232997 the churchs proclamation may not allow a question as to whether it is in treaty with the peculiarities and interests of a race people nation or state
4232998 its real responsibility arises out of its intention to be proclamation of the word of god
4232999 it is on the basis of its actual origin and ground of the actual essence of the church n b previously identified as the person of jesus christ that church proclamation and with it the church herself is really attacked and called in question
4233000 the church can neither absolutely question her proclamation nor absolutely put it right upon her human work she can once more only do a human work of criticism and revision
4233001 the actual thing to be proclaimed we may not and cannot expect to hear from dogmatics
4233002 must be found from time to time in the middle space between the definite text of the bible in the context of the whole bible and the community in the definite situation of the varying present
4233003 the normal and central fact with which dogmatics has to do is very simply the churchs sunday sermon of yesterday and to morrow the church stands or falls by this function which is enjoined upon her she has every cause to take dogmatic work very seriously as the criticism and revision of this her decisive function
4233004 church proclamation demands dogmatics so far as the proclamation of it is a responsible act
4233005 what dogmatics can give is not contents but guidance it may and ought to give counsel in all seriousness but it neither can nor ought to claim to give orders in the church
4233006 imagined that it could master the problems of life better than the church
4233007 the language about god to be found in the church is mean to be proclamation with the claim that in accordance with its commission it has to tell humans the word of god to be heard in faith i 1 51
4233008 we stand under the sign of decision between a human existence that forgets god is absolutely neutral towards god i e absolutely in conflict with him and the same existence awakened by god in his revelation through faith to existence in the church to a hold upon his promise
4233009 then he also sanctifies their language into the language about god which is found in the church
4233010 can found the church directly and afresh when and where and as it pleases him
4233011 but is not aware of the essential distinctiveness of proclamation and language about god when it rests upon a commission to and for humans
4233012 to himself modernist thought hears man answer without any one having called him it hears him talk to himself
4233013 cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that the church lives from and by the latter means of grace
4233014 one may quite well be a priest without ever preaching
4233015 the connection of word and faith but the connection between a divine being as the cause and divine creaturely being as the operation with the proper reservation we may also say that roman catholic dogmatics understands by grace not an historical but a physical event
4233016 the strictly personal free word of god which reaches its goal in the equally personal free hearing of man the hearing of faith which in its turn can only be regarded as grace
4233017 between god as the found on the one part and the
4233018 therefore not sacrament alone and not preaching alone nor yet to speak meticulously simply preaching and sacrament in double track but preaching plus sacrament plus the visible act that confirms its human language as gods work is the constitutive element the visible centre of the churchs life
4233019 the introductory part of dogmatics in which it is our business to explain its particular path of knowledge
4233020 we are forbidden today to come to the point in the dogmatics without giving an express and explicit account of the question as to the way to knowledge
4233021 the church has to measure her language about god by the measure of her own essence i e the divine revelation but her language about god is the language of the per se faithless and anti faith reason of humans
4233022 really responsible up to date theological thought will reveal itself by refusing to discuss the basis of its ground and by actually achieving its own consummation as thought on this ground and by being thereby actually on the spot as the witness of faith against unbelief
4233023 what unbelief expecgts of faith is purely the one thing that it should be an event it is not in our power to cause this event
4233024 the essential knowledge as to the standing menace to all its pronouncements
4233025 dogmatic prolegomena i e the necessity for giving an explicit account of the special path of knowledge to be trodden by dogmatics must be an inner necessity ground in the thing itself
4233026 with a form or forms of faith inw hich it recognises itself in form but not in content difference of faith is faith in which we hear unbelief express itself in words
4233027 in real encounter with heresy faith is plunged into conflict with itself
4233028 but heresies simply force us to make it clear how far in what sense upon what inner ground we stand here and not there and so understand revelation not in a catholic nor yet in a modernist but in an evangelical sense
4233029 conflict with the jews pagans and atheists was purely incidental pursued with nothing like the same emphasis and zeal as that against heretics

4233036 theyre going to want the book to do good so theyll treat it like a traditional publisher
4233037 writers of literary fiction stay away were sorry we dont employ editors with masters degrees in english and literature to edit works of literary importance we are incompetent in this realm so go elsewhere

4233065 kat kinkade and the communal theories of equality and of sharing
4233066 secular communal economies must to be successful be full of holes i think that if they are too tight too equal they will fail because people would not be able to stand the constraints most people value small liberties more than they value small equalities and therefore society works better if the rules arent too rigid equality is a means not an end
4233067 i looked carefully at my own willingness to live by a code i had myself created but no longer fully believed in i decided that twin oaks had a right to expect me to live by its rules however naive i now thought its principles so thats what i do i no longer preach absolute equality

4233085 about one year earlier two young americans had also come to
4233086 i have been to paris i have talked with both
4233087 extremely disturbing statements on issues which it is clear he was very poorly informed and on which he chose to lecture the government and the people of kenya on how to manage our country
4233088 you just decided just like that in like five minutes
4233089 you just look at them and its obvious that shes like a sister or something to him he doesnt look at her like he looks at you usually he doesnt even say goodbye to people when he can pop down the street and visit didnt he like blow up a star to say goodbye to you
4233090 but he said goodbye and that was it in his mind ya know i mean not that im not welcome or somethin like that but he moved on maybe i shoulda
4233091 just dont get all possessive or anything okay thats the fastest way to make a guy especially one like mr undomesticated up there freak out
4233092 if theres one thing in this universe i understand its sulking because you feel left out so just ignore it hang out with me your new bestest friend ever as of now because i say so and enjoy that were
4233093 is it rotten an selfish that im a bit jealous
4233094 the guy youre in love with and have a totally undefined relationship with is holding hands with another girl even knowing that hes totally not into her its still gonna smart
4233095 girl youre in love with the only living time lord im a time lady
4233096 there is no such thing as normal in this sitch
4233097 ive spent the last decade speaking sunnydale which believe me is a language unto itself besides i think my heads still more human than time lady
4233098 things have been so nuts we havent really talked since we got up with your dude youre kinda quiet here lately missy
4233099 we were there for three weeks and didnt do nothing but talk
4233100 i jus i don know what to say to him anymore its like he was so glad to see me and then nothing im back in my room an its farther away from his than it used to be now i know he dont have feelings for donna or anything so why
4233101 um i think i covered that back in the time lord section of this discussion
4233102 though i think that could just as easily be summed up as the male portion seriously hes a guy might be a thousand year old time lord but hes still a boy
4233103 look tyler youve gotta accept that the dudes got some issues hes practically a thousand years old and hes lost a lot of people trust isnt easy for the ancient believe me ive met my share
4233104 what else do you want me to say i dunno what to do
4233105 say youre gonna walk up and plant one on him duh
4233106 see right now hes in there probably getting into something wicked stupid into which he will also drag all of us and the fastest way to distract him from that is you walking up and
4233107 but seriously whats he gonna do send you home to your mom cause crossing an impossible barrier between universes and introducing him to the only other living member of his species doesnt say that you love him nah itll be just ruined if you kiss him
4233108 what if he says no alright what would i do then pretend it didnt happen just go on with adventures or pop round to shareens have a good cry and move on aint like hes jimmy stone i cant just go find new one by the corner you know
4233109 look im not an expert on ye olde gallifreyan dude but my sister once dated a guy that had a couple centuries on her he worshiped her but he was so convinced that he was wrong for her that it took her best friend freaking out and screeching at him for making buffy feel like crap for him to realize how bad he was messing with her and further that the smoochies were imminent of course them having sex ended up almost destroying the world but thats so not the point
4233110 i mean i know i was unconscious during the reunion but donna told me about it with the tears and the drama he totally loves you
4233111 hardcore you brits need to stop mocking the accent by the way gonna stab you in your sleep
4233112 hes going to get us in trouble lets walk on down to the water maybe we can find a spot of beach to sit on and watch the ocean
4233113 chillin hey im gonna go back to find donna and well stay by the tardis promise
4233114 yeah i know sorry it was too hot in there
4233115 were in tortuga mid 18th century bit fuzzy on the when i got very conflicting answers from the men in the pub but they were very drunk so its excused
4233116 learned a long time ago don never trust the word of a bloke after more than two beers
4233117 rum seems to be the drink of choice these days
4233118 vile really but they appear to be fond of it and i booked us on a cruise
4233119 advanced booking carnival wont be opening for a couple hundred years ya know
4233120 a pathetic imitation of the real thing no were going on a real ship with sails
4233121 its been decades and decades since i was on a ship that traveled outside the vortex
4233122 somewhere in the caribbean i would assume i had to produce gold
4233123 but theyll be taking the four of us and the tardis to wherever it is that theyre going a brand new adventure rose a historical journey
4233124 theres a whole ride devoted to it at disney world
4233125 though i don think theres so many women chasing men with rollin pins here
4233126 you know in all my travels ive yet to make it there
4233127 after johnny was born my little brother that is mum and pete took us and mickey to florida mum said she could finally afford to take me on a proper holiday and she was
4233128 she knew id find a way back so she wanted to make sure i had good memories from there so i wouldnt forget her
4233129 even if it were possible to forget your mum any mum it would never be possible to forget jackie tyler
4233130 oi what have i said about talking bout my mum
4233131 i guess she is memorable though youll never forget being slapped by her
4233132 id say youre bein a girl but thatd be too mean to my sex
4233133 best get back to the tardis you and the girls need to get some rest ship leaves at daybreak
4233134 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4233135 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4233136 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4233137 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4233138 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4233139 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4233140 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4233141 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4233142 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4233143 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4233144 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4233145 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4233146 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4233147 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4233148 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4233149 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4233150 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4233151 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4233152 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4233153 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4233154 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4233155 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4233156 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4233157 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4233158 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4233159 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4233160 the right information has to be given to the people
4233161 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4233162 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4233163 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4233164 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4233165 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4233166 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4233167 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4233168 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers lin declined to answer when asked if peiyi should be included in the closing ceremony except to say that he was not the director he said his daughter was not doing any rehearsals and that he presumed she would not be involved in the closing ceremony

4233194 look at this so and so found out some info
4233195 i was able to provide them with additional evidence relating to the scampi inquiry and mr peters involvement in that
4233196 that new evidence i believe takes the complaint and the issue to another level
4233197 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4233198 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases

4233223 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4233224 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4233225 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4233226 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4233227 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4233339 i hated that i left in terms that i left an unbelievable place which is still what i consider home i love where i went too its different i wanted the combination of ad and football and we do football all the time just about all times of the year for a person that likes to do it its perfect
4233340 the first thing that sticks out i think is that the rules in kansas really limit a football player
4233341 the next main one that would stick out is spring football it s 18 padded days 3 more days than division i has the third and probably something that would not necessarily say is a big one but it is is all coaches here have to be a member of the district they have to be employed by the school district we have 16 assistant coaches and all are on our campus all in our building all eight middle school coaches are under my contracts so they answer directly to me all coaches answer to me basically so athletics is run by athletic people a lot of schools in kansas very few of the coaches are in the building i think it s detrimental to the growth of a player we have coaches in every area of the building
4233342 we feel pretty good about it we tied for a playoff spot and were beat in a tiebreaker in 2007 this summer we were state 7 on 7 champs and won the were not loaded with a lot of division i athletes like others are they are learning and playing pretty hard another big difference is and i don t mean this in a derogatory way but sometimes at olathe north there would be weeks where it would be a miracle if we lost a game we have no games like that here every night were at the stage where we go to a stadium and feel that we have a pretty good chance that means about 500 we played with about everyone except southlake carroll and we were without some players but for nine games we were competitive and we could have won eight of them we could have lost a few too but we tell our people too go to richland you can ride to the stadium knowing we have a chance tonight before when we came here after the first year when we were in the playoffs we moved up to 5a and weren t competitive

4233474 hi kevin allow me to quickly introduce myself my names tia and im the community manager for
4233475 outstanding post its great to read about your success and how youve made it happen im going to
4233476 great points well presented i agree with you i did a post on october 12th that presented five
4233477 a perversion of christianity intended by design to woo blacks from faith and toward marxist thought
4233478 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4233479 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4233480 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4233481 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4233482 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4233483 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4233484 before georgias aggression talks with georgia were possible but now there will be no talks with georgia
4233485 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4233486 i have heard threats that we are not going to be admitted to the world trade organization but we see clearly that nobody is going to admit us there anyway
4233487 we regret that the u s still refuses to admit the real cause for what happened which is that mikheil saakashvilis regime in violation of all its international obligations unleashed a war against the people of south ossetia
4233488 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians
4233489 the reports are he was drinking alcohol but we cant confirm anything until we get a blood result back because that is the most crucial evidence
4233490 changing logos or buying public relations spin will do little to change the lack of affection many amateur fishers feel for the department
4233491 littered with bad process bad science cases of disappearing submissions and a general display of arrogance that has no place in a democracy
4233492 amateur fishers have been the meat in the sandwich too often for our liking with doc vastly over estimating our impacts
4233493 while we all agree the protection of hectors and maui dolphins is essential bans in places that dolphins have never been seen only serves to undermine docs credibility
4233494 far too often those really responsible for major habitat destruction and species decline seem to have got away scott free
4233495 doc have found amateur fishers a much easier target when seeking to create marine conservation areas rather than concentrating on destructive bulk harvesting methods or poor land management where the real damage is done
4233496 with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the government writ at all cost
4233497 insiders said tsvangirai was parroting the same sentiments expressed by the united states the european union and britain
4233498 a fresh position paper titled notes on the dialogue to date which appeared to repudiate all the agreements already signed and would have set back the status of the negotiations by weeks
4233499 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4233500 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4233501 it looks as if were near agreement and we hope to make a joint announcement today
4233502 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4233503 deliverance from bondage distress or from liability to any evil
4233504 turn thee lord unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my distresses
4233505 turn thee lord unto me and have your upon me for i am deprived of comfort and suffering continued pain in my body and mind the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my oppressions and misery
4233506 go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice
4233507 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation
4233508 o keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for i put my trust in thee let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait on thee
4233509 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
4233510 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair
4233511 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4233512 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4233513 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4233514 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4233515 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4233516 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4233517 the provisional cease fire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4233518 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4233519 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4233520 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4233521 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4233522 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4233523 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4233524 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4233525 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4233526 the full burden of the premium there can be administrative expenses as well
4233527 theres no health exam or lab tests just some questions
4233528 it does suggest that diversity in this country is hitting the whole population more rapidly especially in the younger population
4233529 we have all these set notions of who works in what area and what type of person is employed in certain areas
4233530 well the population is going to be a whole lot more diverse in 20 to 30 years were going to have to retrain people to do different jobs
4233531 even if we had not projected an increase in immigration the natural increase of the hispanic population is quite a bit higher than the non hispanic population
4233532 if you are concerned about congestion pollution sprawl or preservation of open space
4233533 if you drive on the roads of california this is really bad news but if you sell cars to the people of california its not necessarily bad news
4233534 they will be paying the taxes that support the aging baby boomers in their retirement
4233535 my mother is in heaven and i know she will forgive him
4233536 his actions are not the kind that i can forgive
4233537 we want to make sure this area is safe for you
4233538 and we want to make sure you get as expeditiously across the street as you can
4233539 hows the voter supposed to know by reading the ballot title and summary that it only applies to one year
4233540 to me you take a quarter from over here you replace it with a quarter from over here isnt that what that says
4233541 does it specifically list every nuance and every detail i would agree with everyone in the courtroom that it doesnt
4233542 i dont know if im the average voter but it took me three hours to understand it
4233543 i went to the state supreme court a bunch of times and ive walked out of there thinking i lost and i won and i walked out of there thinking i won and i lost
4233544 we know there are more and more families who speak spanish in our area
4233545 they just wanted her to feel great when it comes to all wish kids theyre all the same theyre just struggling at such a young age

4233555 im glad for the lost flamingoes of bombay and thrilled for each of the authors on the long list
4233556 in a media ecology where television has systematically dumbed down our generation the revival of reading habits is crucial so anything a book award for instance that fosters reading must be encouraged reading is a dignified gesture and its a way of being friends with the aesthetic of someones imagination
4233557 i dont know about the genres of the books on the longlist i am not lucky enough to have read the books good literary fiction should be a great read most people dont read for the beauty of sentences but a hypnotic engagement of story no writer can let his own literary bombast come in the way of his tale that would be a kind of intellectual masturbation where only one guy goes home happy
4233558 i have an essay published next month in aids sutra random house an anthology illuminated with some genius pieces on aids by kiran desai salman rushdie amratya sen william dalrymple and others
4233559 i have 2 maps confirming the name meservy for the stream flowing into the bog at nortons pond the first is a hand drawn map of lake megunticook and nortons ponds by brampton parker of camden in 1948 he called it a creek the map was sold commercially the second was created by maine lake charts inc of gardiner me it was first done in 2001 and revised in 2003 it calls the stream a brook i remember as a 10 year old in 1937 fishing for trout but catching only yellow perch there
4233560 i get mad if the maid does all the housework
4233561 the mustang is an outstanding value and it satisfies owners from the six cylinder buyer all the way up to the muscle car guy whos driving a shelby 500kr
4233562 it really speaks to the quality of mustang and its status as an american icon
4233563 the mustang is a symbol of power performance and coolness and anyone who owns one knows that they are a part of something special a piece of americana that goes back 45 years
4233564 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
4233565 our t shirt promotions have been a popular promotion for us going back multiple years
4233566 it happens that this is a great time to recognize joakim soria for his contributions particularly making the all star team
4233567 we certainly recognize that the nickname mexicutioner is out there
4233568 but from what i understand whb cant and hasnt taken ownership of that nickname
4233569 our feeling is that joakim soria is the perfect player to honor with a t shirt giveaway and the timing has to do with the success of his season and making the all star team
4233570 the residents that our folks have interacted with have said that they would pay the increase in taxes because they want the service they want to know they have an ambulance near by and ready to respond and help them
4233571 it makes me nervous because the health care of the people in this township is very important to the town and all the seven towns that are involved in this we care we understand but we also have to look out for the tax payers ronald crandall deputy supervisor town of richfield
4233572 there not asking the tax payers for their opinion if they want to ask the tax payers for their opinion then make these decisions let them do it
4233573 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4233574 mbna had the foresight to realize that you can locate a successful multinational business on the coast of maine and have the labor force to meet your needs
4233575 they were the pioneers and businesses are going to continue to come
4233576 weve had success because we went out to get it
4233577 hes tenacious smart straightforward he doesnt tell you what you want to hear he tells you what you need to hear
4233578 we often dont know what company they represent during the first round of talks
4233579 we coordinate those visits down to where they will go who they will see what questions they will have about everything from minimum wage to parking questions for local officials
4233580 the fact that we have a trained work force from the mbna days is key if you dont have that nothing else matters
4233581 boston financial got 250 applications right out of the gate and they were tickled with the quality of the applicants
4233582 were in the 200 mile corridor around boston and will continue to attract businesses and jobs from people who dont want to pay the heavy price of doing business in massachusetts
4233583 i was concerned because if there was a place in the state that has them and we dont were done
4233584 in the long term we will build on that number
4233585 we wont face a disaster if any one company leaves
4233586 athenahealth and boston financial are hiring local people to remodel their buildings using maine architects and maine craftspeople landscapers all maine companies
4233587 that has a significant measurable economic impact even this early in the process
4233588 sometimes people turn to the legislature to answer questions that might be better answered at home
4233589 the legislature cant legislate atmosphere it cant legislate the intangibles that make businesses come to this area
4233590 if you look across a broader spectrum its not easy to do business in midcoast maine in a more general sense
4233591 the lines of communication are longer although i used to say this a lot when i represented mbna in the area modern communications are such that you dont need to be sitting in boston or new york to communicate effectively with a lot of your customers
4233592 outlying areas peripheral areas that sell their communities on a clean environment an environment where people care about one another and care about the vibrancy and well being of both the communities and their neighbors is really positive
4233593 but items such as cost to transport things cost in taxes and related levies are high in this area as compared to other parts of the country
4233594 as we look at this stage of the development of the midcoast area balanced change is important and without it will come stagnation
4233595 and with stagnation much fewer opportunities for the young people of this community
4233596 for the good of the community all you really need is for a person like charlie cawley of old to say i like this i like this atmosphere and though on paper it may not seem like the best place to do business i want to do business here
4233597 we thought the people we interacted with in the area were good people with a good work ethic and the likelihood was that they would do well in the jobs that we could bring to the area
4233598 the company felt that it needed to give back to the community and give back to the civic organizations and social organizations that improved the vibrancy and the quality of life for people in the community
4233599 which by extension was good for the people in the company as well
4233600 the consistency of mbnas earnings over the period of time that it was a public company is very very clear
4233601 it was hugely profitable hugely successful very bottom line oriented when you looked at it as a corporation
4233602 the part that isnt known by many people was that mbna was enormously bottom line focused and while the company was benevolent in the largest sense of that word we had a business model that was customer oriented from start to finish
4233603 certainly people could look at the area and say its a lovely area and a nice place to vacation but its much more than that
4233604 the relationships that were developed within this company and by extension within this community will live within all of us for the rest of our lives
4233605 i think that the greatest legacy is the legacy of the youth of the area that i think were affected in a positive way by being involved by being children of people who worked here or by some of the outreach that was done with younger people within this community
4233606 buildings are monuments of a type but thats like going into a cemetery and seeing what was
4233607 i prefer to look at vibrant things to look at people and say that person does great things in this community i feel happy if i could have done anything to support those people
4233608 we learned to be a little calmer in the area here
4233609 we learned that everyone in the midcoast made for a very friendly and wonderful community but they also were our strongest critics that made us a better organization
4233610 what is this business person trying to do are they trying to do something wholesome or not

4233612 guayaquil the capital of the guayas province is the largest and most populous city in ecuador located on the pacific coast it has a tropical climate and is known as the pacific pearl it is the main port of ecuador thus it is of great economic importance to the country
4233613 once little more than a commercial hub frequented more by business visitors than travelers ecuador s largest city has recently been swept away in a current of cultural revival
4233614 ma mere nencouragerait jamais une enfant de 14 ans alt rer son corps
4233615 if and when that happens then we will address it
4233616 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4233617 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4233618 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4233619 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone
4233620 i know the deal many books are called few are chosen a million things can go wrong this all could evaporate like tomorrow but i have a really good feeling about this team and its already been fun
4233621 see hear people who it seems wants to make something controversial when really its just something to celebrate and be proud of
4233622 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan
4233623 all of our friends seem to be getting divorced or breaking up its depressing and makes me think theres something wrong with me for trying to make my relationship work when i try to talk to my friends about a fight i had with tad they just tell me to find someone better suited to you or relationships are overrated anyway the whole there are lots of fish in the sea mindset isnt helpful when im trying to make my relationship work now
4233624 if jeff and i are going through a difficult time for whatever reason i dont feel alone i have at least two other women i can talk to who have been through difficult times but theyre still happily married i know im not alone in my struggles and that makes a world of difference and i have a few single friends who are supportive of my relationship and committed relationships in general even though theyre not in one now all that encouragement among my friends really helps whenever i start to worry that the challenges of a romantic relationship might be too much for me
4233625 naw baby only mornings when i wake up next to the most beautiful woman in the world
4233626 got a sec cap i need to update you on a possible complication to the hellman case
4233627 what now this case seems to have nothing but complications
4233628 samantha dunbar has a history of domestic abuse a real bastard of an ex husband
4233629 dunbar doesnt appear to be her real name she started using it after she moved here her real name is eva byrne welch weve been assuming the difference in surnames with her brother meant she was still using her exs name
4233630 i stopped by last night to see if she was up to giving a statement still need to do that by the way thats my top priority this morning if shes up to it anyway she mentioned she didnt want her ex to have access to her room at the hospital she was obviously terrified of him i handled that then went home and began to see what i could find out about him his name is richard welch so the discrepancies in names jumped out at me immediately
4233631 welch is well connected to the dc power structure a real insiders insider
4233632 the dc police have a file several inches thick on him assault breaking and entering stalking allegations filed by sam and several other women including his current wife he even has a couple of rape investigations in his jacket but one way or another they all went away and the son of a bitch walked
4233633 not from what i got from the detective i spoke with at dcs svu according to det ross parrise the evidence had a way of disappearing before trial medical records and personnel became sketchy on the pertinent details that sort of thing apparently his old man was wired into every corner of the capital could make or break careers add to that the welch family is loaded its not hard to see the vics never had a chance
4233634 his favorite victim from what ive found so far she was a promising young attorney with a law firm that specialized in environmental issues was on the fast track for a partnership when she met the bastard the firm where she now works esp must know more than theyve told us unless they didnt do a background check someone had to know she was using an alias i cant imagine they didnt ask for a copy of her license to practice law in new york state at the very least the other option is she used phony documents to establish her bona fides
4233635 so she gave a false name when she was arrested following the demonstration this summer and may have lied to her employer to get her job
4233636 yeah but from what little she told me last night she probably didnt have much choice if she wanted to escape from welch the last time he broke into her apartment he beat and raped her found her personal information and cleaned out her bank accounts parrise confirmed what little she told me about that incident the way the violence was escalating he would have killed her eventually weve both seen the pattern too many times not to appreciate what she was up against
4233637 yeah but it makes her vulnerable on cross plus her history of abuse could be twisted to suggest she overreached to what was happening that will be a tough sell but weve both seen the crap lawyers can unload on a jury
4233638 since none of the charges against her ex resulted in a conviction the defense could tear her apart on the stand saying shes unstable and a compulsive liar anything to sling mud on our case
4233639 nothing that helps once she married welch her career went into reverse clients began to drop her under pressure from the old man apparently sonny boy wanted her to stay home under his thumb so the job had to go the loss of clients was accompanied by frequent absences from work due to accidents in the home reports of domestic disturbances called in by neighbors you know the pattern within two years she was out of a job and blackballed at other firms
4233640 no finesse necessary from what parrise told me no need for it
4233641 once word made the rounds the welch family didnt want her working preferred having their women play a more traditional role in the home doors closed in her face friendships dried up and she soon found herself isolated and completely at welchs mercy
4233642 why didnt she leave she had a law degree after all she could have gone to another city and started over years ago why wait so long to make a break
4233643 she did try but he always managed to track her down what money she had he managed to steal with the aid of his accountants so it was hard for her to get very far parrise said he tried to get him for kidnap twice he almost lost his job each time was demoted the second time
4233644 she made it as far as la seven years ago she was pregnant at the time she had already lost three babies from miscarriages welch found her two months later literally snatched her off the street drugged her to keep her quiet then tossed her in his private jet for a one way trip back to her private hell she had a fourth miscarriage the day after he got her back a maid found her passed out on the floor of the bedroom in a pool of blood and called an ambulance
4233645 welch apparently was allowed to check her out of the hospital while she was still in the recovery room following a dnc wasnt even lucid from the meds they had given her he literally waltzed in and carried her out still in her hospital gown pulled the ivs out of her arm while the staff watched and did nothing
4233646 a neighbor saw him carrying her into the elevator at their downtown address she could see sam was bleeding heavily from post surgical complications and called for help probably saved her life sam almost hemorrhaged to death
4233647 the neighbor toni collins pitched a fit and threatened to go to the press if he wasnt charged she was found a week later raped and beaten behind a dumpster in the burbs eyewitnesses to her abduction all ided welch as the one that grabbed her but their memories deserted them at trial plus the rape kit went missing along with most of the other physical evidence that proved he was her rapist
4233648 top it off ms collins suffered serious brain trauma from the beating welchs lawyer made mincemeat out of her on the stand
4233649 anna simpson the maid that called for the ambulance was fired apparently she was supposed to ask for permission to call 911 her car was found down an embankment next to the southbound lanes of i 95 just north of richmond a month later car had been torched no evidence or clues of who was responsible
4233650 no one knows anna was last seen in a mcdonalds parking lot talking to a man fitting welchs description shes still missing no body has ever been found sensing a pattern here cap
4233651 apparently the welch family tree is more a series of corporate mergers fortunes made in various defense energy and mining interests theyve known where all the bodies were buried since at least the korean war
4233652 welch senior is on the board of a dozen major corporations sits on the board of a number of philanthropic organizations and has had the direct line to every president and cabinet secretary for the last twenty five years until junior began to make them fodder for the gossips the family made a practice of keeping a very low profile you had to be an insiders insider to know them
4233653 and junior has been a popular topic of the gossips
4233654 daddy had the pull to keep most of his indiscretions out of the press parisse said welchs file is full of one incident after the other the collins case is the only one that made a ripple and barely that coverage was almost nonexistent sam was in trouble the second he set eyes on her and nobody warned her no wonder she says shes all alone she has been for most of the last fourteen years
4233655 in name at least younger brother is a major in the air force his career wasnt going anywhere until after sams marriage to welch matthew byrne suddenly had all the right stuff influential supporters marriage to the daughter of his base commander prestigious postings
4233656 im not going to like where this goes am i
4233657 his careers been in a nosedive ever since sams divorce from welch became final both he and his wife blame his problems on sam seem to think she owed it to them to remain welchs punching bag hes been in iraq since the war began likely to stay there a while longer parrise thinks its a 50 50 toss up whether hell support his sister or sell her out to welch hoping to regain his favor
4233658 so how did sam manage to get welch to agree to the divorce
4233659 she was unable to have children after the last miscarriage more likely after the second round of surgery she needed after his stunt in the recovery room
4233660 senior wanted an heir so sam had to be replaced shes just lucky she got to leave on her own two feet and not in a body bag he strung out the divorce for several years until one of his girlfriends got pregnant the not so lucky winner of the title welch broodmare hasnt fared much better than sam even after shes spit out 2 kids in just over three years two boys a baby girl was stillborn last month after carol welch suffered an accidental fall down the stairs
4233661 not much she sanitized the story a lot ive heard the lies abused women tell too many times not to recognize the signs when i hear them shes still coming to terms with what that bastard did to her and frankly im not sure she can handle a trial especially if this all comes out we both know its doubtful her past will remain hidden once the defendants lawyers start poking around
4233662 yeah weve both seen what money can buy talk to casey and update her she needs to be ready if they decide to go for a preemptive strike and leak the stories to the press does welch seniors power stretch to new york
4233663 it did until recently but he had a stroke two days after his daughter in law lost the baby

4233693 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4233694 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4233695 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4233696 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4233697 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4233698 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4233715 having cancer has its low points but what its taught me going through the treatment is its all about hope
4233716 people go through a lot when theyre diagnosed with cancer
4233717 but i was absolutely determined that the goal was to eradicate the cancer if this treatment was going to do it so be it
4233718 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4233719 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4233720 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4233721 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4233722 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4233723 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4233724 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4233725 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4233726 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4233727 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4233728 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4233729 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4233730 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4233731 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4233732 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4233733 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4233734 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4233735 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4233736 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4233737 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4233738 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4233739 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4233741 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4233742 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4233743 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4234251 by willfully breaching the constitution of the order of canada and the judicial standards of conduct beverley mclachlin has compromised the integrity of canadas judicial system
4234252 if the supreme court justices are to be respected as impartial and objective interpreters of the law why is the chief justice violating the constitution of the order of canada so that a divisive and controversial person can be given such a prestigious award this strongly suggests a bias towards a pro abortion political agenda

4234262 there was something magical about the american sideshow something that made the people want to spend a dime for the chance to see something out of the ordinary when a dime was worth something this work is pure fluxist it lies not within the physical manifestation of the sideshow itself but rather the experience that the viewer takes away with them and the story they tell others of what theyve seen professor josefs cabinet of curiosities is a chance for people to experience something that will soon disappear from existence

4234264 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4234265 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion

4234271 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated

4234288 we condemn this wanton taking of human life and mourn the death and suffering of all the peoples of this region

4234291 we are deeply concerned about the destruction taking place in georgia and are praying fervently for the people of georgia as well as for those who are causing this chaos

4234295 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available

4234297 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
4234298 workers that do not accept the companys offer could be punished by a 12 month wages freeze
4234299 this plan by telstra human resources to deceive and trick workers has been in operation since february the documents show that telstras human resources managers have had no intention of genuinely consulting with staff or taking into account their concerns over pay and conditions
4234300 telstra management has already determined what it will offer staff when their current enterprise agreement expires next month
4234301 it is clear proof that telstra management never intended to follow through with discussions it started in may with unions over a new collective agreement for its workers
4234302 it also shows telstra management misled its 32 000 staff and the australian public about the reasons it broke off talks with unions in july
4234303 telstra management has no respect for the rights of its workers to be represented by their union
4234304 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
4234305 people loved the audi r8 recognition but stuff like the burger king placement they really werent huge fans of

4234339 customers have responded well and they will continue to see it even more integrated into our stores during the second half of the year
4234340 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent a broad income segment and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation in healthcare and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer

4234355 its our audience political and an inside the beltway crowd its like an industry convention from an ad standpoint its where the political crowd is and we sell a hell of a lot of advertising
4234356 its the one time that that national journal products are read by everyone and we are running head to head
4234357 washington post is known for its coverage of politics and the convention is the big story
4234358 we are a newspaper about congressional politics and federal politics which is looked at to cover political events
4234359 even though the outcome of the conventions are a foregone conclusion there is still news to be covered
4234360 its a great opportunity to expand our current advertisers reach
4234361 they are good and savvy at political reporting we are the only ones in town that will have politico and we hope it sets us apart
4234362 we thought it would be good to have presence at the convention

4234380 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4234381 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4234382 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4234383 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4234384 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4234385 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4234386 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4234387 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4234388 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4234389 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4234390 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4234391 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4234392 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4234393 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4234394 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4234395 i have no proof so i cant make an affirmation
4234396 its unfair that people keep saying the chinese are too young to compete
4234397 if they think they can tell someones age just by looking at them well if you look at the foreign athletes they have so much more muscles than the chinese they are so strong do you then say that they are doping
4234398 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4234399 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4234400 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4234401 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4234402 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4234403 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4234404 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4234405 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4234406 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4234407 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4234408 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4234409 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4234410 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4234430 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4234431 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4234432 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4234433 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4234434 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4234435 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4234436 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4234437 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4234438 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4234439 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4234440 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4234441 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4234442 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4234443 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4234444 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4234445 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4234446 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4234447 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4234448 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4234449 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4234450 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4234451 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4234452 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4234453 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4234454 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4234455 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4234486 we are satisfied with the changes even though the full details are yet to come
4234487 the government approval was an unexpected and pleasant surprise also the decision to give arrears from 2006 is a huge bonus
4234488 the commission report was a letdown but now it seems that the hike will be satisfactory
4234489 the government has agreed to some of our demands but a lot remains to be done
4234490 the government is giving arrears only on the basic pay and not all the benefits

4234496 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4234497 this is their right and women must strive hard to get their rights malpractices like dowry discrimination against girl child female foeticide domestic violence and drug addiction must be eradicated from our society
4234498 our dominions rest on a thin crust likely to be rent by titanic forces of social change and religious revolution

4234509 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow human being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles

4234665 not only is greenplus unique in the industry but it also offers a double benefit for the homeowner
4234666 customers get their covered appliance or system replaced under their warranty saving them the cost of replacement plus they can save money in the long run by using more efficient products that have proven to help cut costs on energy bills
4234667 we certainly want to do our part to help protect and preserve the environment for future generations and we also want to help our customers save even more money
4234668 when you consider the number of replacements that we make in a year the difference in efficiency improvements can really add up not only in real dollars saved but also in reduced carbon emissions and environmental impact
4234669 ive gotten star of the week at least 15 20 times but it does absolutely nothing for me as an employee
4234670 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4234671 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4234672 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4234673 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4234674 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4234675 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
4234676 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
4234677 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different
4234678 im not going to play gotcha with one candidate and not with the other this way it will be totally fair you compare apples to apples
4234679 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4234680 im called as a pastor to shepherd all the flock and i have in my church democrats and republicans and liberals and conservatives and moderates and everybody in between
4234681 and my calling is to shepherd all those people so i dont think its appropriate for pastors to endorse
4234682 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4234683 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others

4234689 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4234690 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4234691 were not gonna speculate on the number of layoffs or if they are even necessary today were simply framing the issue for you
4234692 today everythings on the table that i would tell you the mayor has said that he will not increase property taxes thats a certainty anything else weve got some tough choices to make
4234693 we need more police not less that would meet with some strong resistance especially in light of the current spike in violence
4234694 thats my calculation theyre saying it will be between 1 000 and 2 000
4234695 weve got 500 million sitting in the skyway fund take 100 million out of there tif funds have close to 400 million take out the key unlock the safe and tap into that the downside is we need springfield to permit that suspend the aldermanic menu program for a year saving 60 million and stop building for a while i know its a good thing for our city but weve got to stop take a deep breath count to ten and postpone some of these capital projects
4234696 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap
4234697 california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers
4234698 the star results show a crisis persisting in the midst of this success story
4234699 the achievement gap remains staggering and insofar as it is highly correlated with known gaps in learning opportunities unconscionable
4234700 the state still has quite a bit of work to do to bring school conditions for african american and latino students up to par with those that most middle class families in california take for granted
4234701 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
4234702 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations
4234703 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
4234704 think of when you can for instance tell your home computer to boot up email you a file at work and then turn itself off with this someday you could turn your computer on remotely turn it off remotely reboot it anything you like you also could schedule things to happen unattended
4234705 the commission further alleges that heinen then signed fictitious board minutes stating that apples board had approved the grant to jobs on oct 19 at a special meeting of the board of directors a meeting that in fact never occurred
4234706 because of miss mcwilliamss education and her previous experience outside the government we feel she is better qualified to fill a more responsible position
4234707 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4234708 here we have really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4234709 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
4234710 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4234711 results for the first six months demonstrate that the companys breadth of operations has helped stabilize its overall performance in spite of the weak market locally for the sale of new homes
4234712 the company increased revenues from our rental apartment properties and increased the number of lots delivered to lennar corp in st charles fairway village however these increases were not enough to offset a decline in the sales of commercial parcels an expected decrease in homebuilding sales in puerto rico and increased administrative costs
4234713 moreover in the local market the current inventory of homes available for sale and the rate of absorption suggests that the companys pace of lot sales as called for in its sales agreement with lennar corp may be difficult to sustain over the next six to twelve months
4234714 the company expects to continue to rely on its investment property portfolio the sale of commercial parcels and make continued investments in our remaining land holdings until the sales environment for new homes begins to improve
4234715 the increase in multifamily apartment rental revenues resulted from increased revenues from sheffield greens apartments in st charles as construction was not completed until january 31 2007 and not fully occupied during the first quarter of 2007 in addition there were overall rent increases at other rental properties in the united states and puerto rico
4234716 the timing and pace of the settlement of sales of commercial parcels vary from quarter to quarter
4234717 but overall demand for such parcels in st charles remains strong
4234718 the company has substantially completed several major infrastructure improvements in st charles and has broken ground on the top of the hill a highly desirable residential parcel in parque escorial
4234719 the company is continuing to make significant investments that add to the value of our land holdings in the united states and puerto rico
4234720 and should be evaluated over an extended period of time because of the nature of our business in that context we believe these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our companys sound business model which combines land development with our rental apartment portfolio to diversify our corporate revenue sources
4234721 he came in and went into this office and started shooting

4234723 it felt good because they obviously felt they could beat us they werent intimidated by us

4234795 there is no doubt this was orchestrated by the abramson and beshear administrations and is another example of mayor abramson going over the heads of the voters so that he can place his cronies into office
4234796 when given the option of either allowing the people to choose or making decisions behind close doors jerry always goes with his own self interest
4234797 instead of blaming someone we ought to pass a bill that deals with the problem we are in an energy crisis whether you like to admit it or not its affecting anyone and everyones pocketbook

4234808 they want people to see nice pretty things if something isnt pretty they try to obscure it
4234809 it doesnt do good for beijing to show the rest of the country that the capital looks rundown

4234846 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different
4234847 im not going to play gotcha with one candidate and not with the other this way it will be totally fair you compare apples to apples
4234848 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4234849 im called as a pastor to shepherd all the flock and i have in my church democrats and republicans and liberals and conservatives and moderates and everybody in between

4234941 the church condemns as a grave offense against human dignity and justice all those activities of governments or other public authorities which attempt to limit in any way the freedom of couples in deciding about children consequently any violence applied by such authorities in favor of contraception or still worse of sterilization and procured abortion must be altogether condemned and forcefully rejected likewise to be denounced as gravely unjust are cases where in international relations economic help given for the advancement of peoples is made conditional on programs of contraception sterilization and procured abortion
4234942 fear of eternal damnation ensures the economic slavery of millions of faithful men and women and condemns millions of children in south america and africa to lives of poverty and desolation
4234943 the catholic church is making huge inroads into china need i point out the dire consequences for humanity if the laws of the church were to eventually overturn the laws of the chinese state
4234944 the present dread of vatican influence and reach incapacitates action in the face of certain future catastrophe so complete is this dread that all world leaders are rendered mute in the face of its power

4234952 unfortunately our autistic daughter whos doing very well shes been diagnosed with very very severe autism is adopted from china and so she would have had all her vaccines in china before we got her and then she had most of her vaccines given to her in the united states before we got her
4234953 so were probably not the pure case youre looking for
4234954 almost every amish family i know has had somebody from the health department knock on our door and try to convince us to get vaccines for our children
4234955 the younger amish more and more are getting vaccines its a minority of children who vaccinate but that is changing now
4234956 one of them were very certain it was a vaccine reaction even though the government would not agree with that
4234957 the other one im not sure if this child was vaccinated or not
4234958 theres one family that we know their daughter had a vaccine reaction and is now autistic
4234959 she completely quit making eye contact with people she went in her own world
4234960 my husband just said last week that so far weve never met a family that lives a healthy lifestyle and does not vaccinate their children that has an autistic child we havent come across one yet
4234961 everywhere i go outside the amish community i find children who are autistic just because i have an autistic daughter in the grocery store in the park wherever i go in the amish community i simply dont find that
4234962 right are these for me is it ok to eat them

4234966 this is simply not a time for politics as usual
4234967 south dakota remains a longer shot for obama in part because it unlike montana and north dakota was not included in obamas early round of ad buys but it is geographically and demographically similar to its neighbors and scattered polls have showed mccain ahead only modestly
4234968 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone

4234982 as we mark national health center week there are 26 000 persons in the virgin islands without health insurance nearly one in four persons
4234983 there are many in the territory who have a health insurance card but no place to go for care
4234984 a lot of farmers are self employed and have the resources to get health insurance
4234985 many who showed up were people who couldnt afford a doctor
4234986 i think if the canadian public really knew the extent of harm that asbestos has caused i think there would be an outrage over what the federal government is doing
4234987 i cannot describe to you the public health epidemic that unfolded before us and is still happening
4234988 were probably the only industrialized country not tracking the extent of the disease and its impact on our society
4234989 certainly the government will not support anything that may be viewed as critical of asbestos when theyre the chief cheerleaders for the asbestos industry

4235008 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4235009 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4235010 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4235011 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4235012 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected

4235021 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4235022 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4235023 i am convinced that honoring senator clinton s historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4235024 with every voice heard and the democratic party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4235025 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call
4235026 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected

4235043 the computer models have been suggesting the last several days that conditions in the atlantic are becoming favorable for tropical waves to intensify into tropical storms and hurricanes
4235044 we might end up having to use them this year
4235045 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4235046 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4235047 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply

4235056 60 of the u s can stop worrying about housing market
4235057 its a pretty big jump in manufacturing capacity and a big opportunity for the pv industry particularly for thin film
4235058 if we were trying to do it this year it would be all of our production
4235059 sunpower is ramping very quickly by 2010 our production will be at least 650 megawatts
4235060 our plan has always been to produce solar energy on a very large scale to make it cost competitive even in a market like california
4235061 power prices are going up and public policy is requiring utilities to have a portfolio of renewables
4235062 we could see where the cost reductions were coming down and the benefits of scale
4235063 we saw there was a way for us to be competitive with other renewables if we hadnt had the insights from scaling commercial rooftops and pv power plants i dont know if we would have gone for it
4235064 by taking control of the value chain from start to finish by being vertically integrated and cutting out the middleman
4235065 we can be competitive not only with other renewable energy but with conventional energy
4235066 the economies of scale does make pv cost competitive with other renewable energy generating technologies and wouldnt be possible without advances that sunpower and optisolar have been working on
4235067 we take a stringent look at all technologies and were not wedded to a particular one
4235068 the challenge is going to be the magnitude of these projects
4235069 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july

4235080 the proposed sentences of incarceration will send a strong message to all current and future government officials and employees that corruption and violations of the public trust will not be tolerated
4235081 the criminal acts alleged in the indictment and demonstrated at trial spanned five years and reached the highest levels of the virgin islands government
4235082 at all times relevant to their corrupt activities plaskett and biggs were duly appointed and senate confirmed members of the governors cabinet rather than honor the oaths they took to serve the citizens of the virgin islands plaskett and biggs selfishly involved themselves in a massive bribery and kickback scheme which involved at least three government agencies the award of at least seven government contracts valued at approximately 1 4 million and implicated a number of complicit individuals and businesses
4235083 for four years plaskett and biggs corruptly traded their high ranking government positions of power and public trust for personal profit
4235084 plaskett then engaged in a series of calculated risks to obstruct the governments and the grand jurys investigations in his illicit conduct biggs likewise chose the path of deception to evade detection but for this criminal investigation plaskett and biggs might well have succeeded in pillaging the federal and local funds entrusted to their administration and then lying and misleading about their respective roles in the bribery and kickback scheme with impunity the proposed punishments in this case which include terms of incarceration as prescribed by the applicable guidelines range fit their crimes

4235119 well i did get two endorsements from mayors today and thats good
4235120 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him
4235121 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4235122 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4235123 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4235124 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4235125 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
4235126 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention

4235240 it feels like were getting better everyday and that shows good signs for our defense
4235241 we lost a lot of people and we had a lot of good teachers in front of us last season so the guys that left got on us last season and now its our time to use some of the things they taught us
4235242 our defense might be unique but its all we know
4235243 it almost comes natural to us its tough to pick up at the beginning thats why the older guys have to do a good job of teaching the young guys but once you get it you got it

4235248 its not really taking notice because you can go and take notice on the opposite side of the ball the biggest thing i see is we have so much room to get better people say were good right now but we have so much room to get better this year
4235249 you go to tackle noel devine or tackle jock sanders and everyone else seems slow
4235250 anytime we can get the ball back in no 5s hands its a good thing
4235251 our turnovers will be a key to how good we are this year and thats why we work on it all the time in practice
4235252 turnover drills are something we do everyday i just think its very important to the game of football anytime you can get a sudden change or turnover it can really help the team

4235371 if they feel the us is cooperative then they are cooperative on iran
4235372 and if not they feel they can hurt the us on iran

4235376 ze proberen nu met telefonische bijstand de lift te maken

4235384 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4235385 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4235386 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4235387 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4235388 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were

4235390 seeing the gold market rebound in the face of residual dollar strength had to frustrate some of the bears however a sharp rise in energy and grain prices seemed to vastly improve the macro economic outlook toward physical commodity prices which seem to have survived the 8th major end of the bull market call for the year certainly seeing the potential for geopolitical escalation of the russia georgia situation is cause for some flight to quality buying interest and certainly seeing the us stock market under aggressive pressure added to that angle but in the end seeing big gains in several unrelated markets has to favor the bull camp
4235391 the market has had an extended decline and its certainly due for a rally youre starting to see physical demand evolve theres an easing up on the selling pressure around the 800 level
4235392 the vicious sell off has resulted in gold now being massively oversold while bottom calling is a dangerous pursuit and the old market adage to never catch a falling knife remains appropriate value investors and bargain hunters with longer term horizons are likely to be strong buyers at these very depressed levels
4235393 look like theyre trading higher in anticipation of a rally in the euro and a short term decline in the dollar
4235394 anyone holding long positions in gold and oil will probably get an opportunity to cover at higher prices over the next several trading sessions

4235407 we hear all the time the message that exercise is important and yet many of us dont take any notice
4235408 by creating a mental association between a valued aspect of their social identity and the goal of physical activity it was possible to get the women to maintain an increase in their rate of exercise activity
4235409 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4235410 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names

4235414 refugee student needs have to be addressed holistically rather than just their educational needs
4235415 educational institutions need to change the way they think and take on board the broader needs of the refugees such as housing and child care they can do this by having a liaison officer that works with the refugees and external bodies such as service providers
4235416 this should include the identification of students as refugees when enrolling at tertiary institutions so that their progress can be identified and monitored
4235417 it is important for refugees to have a single point of contact a person who they could come to know and to trust this is the one factor that makes the biggest difference
4235418 a program of cross cultural training should also be implemented for tafe and higher education teachers and other staff such as librarians to inform them of the needs of refugees and appropriate responses

4235421 there are no formal reasons to stop these accession talks
4235422 the statements that our accession should be delayed because of events in georgia sound strange it contradicts basic logic common sense and promises that were given by the governments of western countries to russia
4235423 i consider the jewish question anti semitism neither a social nor a religious one even though it sometimes takes these and other forms
4235424 were i to sum up the basel congress in one word
4235425 in paris as i have said i achieved a freer attitude toward anti semitism which i now began to understand historically and to pardon
4235426 no need to worry that homeland had been inserted instead of state the jewish people will read it as jewish state anyhow
4235427 the zionist notion that anti semitism was ineradicable and that jewish life in the diaspora was doomed could not have been more inimical to the world view and daily concerns of american jews

4235436 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4235437 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4235438 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4235439 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4235440 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4235441 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4235442 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4235443 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4235444 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4235445 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4235446 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4235447 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4235448 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement

4235464 es una cuesti n totalmente relativa porque cada vez que alguien se muere se podr a decir que es su fin del mundo pero el alma es eterna as que al morir el cuerpo no significa tampoco que sea el fin del mundo porque uno nacer otra vez en otro cuerpo en este u otro planeta as no se puede realmente hablar de un fin del mundo ni debemos considerar que el planeta est a punto de destruirse eso es simplemente especulaci n
4235465 que es pura especulaci n es una tendencia alarmista que sirve para que algunos medios de comunicaci n de masas aumenten m s sus ventas explotando el miedo colectivo los peri dicos por ejemplo son siempre felices si tienen una nueva tem tica que interese a una mayor lector a
4235466 esas predicciones asociadas al n mero son invenciones que en su momento se les ha ocurrido a algunas personas ese anuncio del fin del mundo para el a o 2 000 no se le hubiera ocurrido mil quinientos a os atr s a nadie eso lo inventaron mucho m s tarde entonces alguien se dio el trabajo de inventar toda esa fantasmagor a y ahora casi en las v speras del a o dos mil todos est n asustados eso es lo que el hombre siempre hace el quiere especular sobre las cosas y no desea entregarse a la realizaci n personal
4235467 de acuerdo a los vedas las escrituras m s antiguas del planeta el universo se crea y se destruye en un d a del se or brahma y ese d a es extremadamente largo pues dura 8 mil 600 millones de a os en cuanto a la vida de la tierra s lo la presente yuga o era llamada kali yuga culminar dentro de cuatrocientos veintisiete mil a os entonces all habr una terminaci n de la yuga actual dios encarnado en el se or kalki aparecer en este mundo y comenzar una nueva era llamada satya yuga
4235468 una destrucci n parcial al final del d a del se or brahma todav a est bien lejos para que ocurra pues faltan millones de a os la mahapralaya o la total destrucci n del universo o mejor dicho de la manifestaci n temporal del universo acontece nicamente cuando termina la vida de brahma que es largu sima entonces ya tiene usted una clara idea de c mo debe verse el tema del fin del mundo y de la forma como se considera la duraci n del universo en la historia v dica
4235469 esos son los s ntomas naturales de la era de kali d nde todo se ha hecho de hierro y hay mucho ego smo es muy natural que la gente intoxicada por tanta droga que consume se est tornando autodestructiva y sea v ctima de una gran confusi n derivada de su desviaci n espiritual y c mo detener esto pues con conciencia de krishna si uno comienza a realizar que no es el cuerpo y yo tengo un gran amor que me est esperando porqu voy a desperdiciar mi tiempo en tonter as eso es b sicamente el punto principal comprender que el amor de krishna nos est esperando lo m s grande lo m s bello de toda la vida nos est esperando c mo vamos a negarlo simplemente por nuestro ego falso y ese olvido de dios ser a demasiado terrible
4235470 la repetici n se habr a efectuado mil a os atr s parece que la historia de la humanidad siempre ha sido la misma explotadores tratando de explotar a sus v ctimas no crea que es diferente a mil a os atr s
4235471 no me parecen algo nuevo has visitado el museo de la inquisici n en lima eso s que parece bien t trico los hombres no han cambiado mucho ellos para defender sus intereses hacen cualquier cosa atacan a cualquier persona eso no es nada nuevo claro que es un hecho que el kali yuga avanza eso no estamos argumentando kali yuga avanza y todas las cosas materialistas pero eso no quiere decir que el a o dos mil o tres mil se acabe el mundo
4235472 pero como se dice si t te mueres el mundo se acaba para t esta gente que habla tanto del fin del mundo deber a prepararse para el momento de la muerte el swami srila prabhupada quien en 1965 trajo el conocimiento v dico a occidente siempre recomend vivir de tal manera como si se fuera a morir hoy as tenemos que vivir esa fue una orden contin a de srila prabhupada simplemente si uno aprovecha tal instrucci n ya no tiene porqu enrrollarse en temores ficticios
4235473 es una pregunta bastante compleja el verdadero refugio est en la conciencia espiritual hoy uno tiene que cambiar aprovechar el maravilloso regalo de la vida que hemos recibido entonces el refugio es uno mismo cuando se vive con principios religiosos en la compa a de devotos eso es lo nico y lo m s sano de todas las cosas uno siempre deber a tratar de vivir en compa a de devotos
4235474 por supuesto bhakti es amor y yoga uni n con dios amar a dios y unirse con el y comprender la necesidad del mundo entero es algo maravilloso esa es realmente una gran oferta una gran invitaci n al mundo entero
4235475 los devotos de krishna ofrecen su ejemplar vegetarianismo vida sana y sencilla con pensamiento elevado sin drogas maravillosas ideas ecol gicas material de estudios sobre la cultura v dica e impresionantes servicios educativos tenemos una academia vaisnava y estamos trabajando en un cd rom con bastante informaci n sobre el yoga m stico pero lo m s intangible que los devotos pueden ofrecer al observador casual es la afectuosa atenci n de un vaisnava para con las personas en general
4235476 en cierta forma las verdaderas religiones siempre est n integradas unas con respecto a las otras porque dios es uno solo quienes no est n verdaderamente interesados en dios pero s en sus intereses mundanos nunca est n identificados con una plataforma de paz y de uni n mas bien ellos siempre est n interesados en la discordia o algo por el estilo
4235477 hay un dicho en el per que dice tengo el orgullo de ser peruano y soy feliz penosamente eso no puede ser as mientras que el peruano haga infeliz a otros por eso para que seamos peruanos y seamos felices debemos dejar de matar a los animales y debemos dejar de hacer tantas cosas que son adh rmicos y que no est n en armon a con dios en realidad el per es uno de los pa ses m s hermosos y est bendecido por dios con maravillosos recursos y paisajes a n as el per necesita conciencia de dios como en cualquiera otra parte para que su gente pueda realizar una vida con mucha m s sensatez y ofrecer horizontes positivos a sus ni os yo soy muy optimista cuando creo que en el per se van a hacer cosas muy maravillosas en los pr ximos a os

4235484 the results for the second quarter of 2008 provide the third consecutive quarter of continued improvements over the same period for the previous year gems revenue for the second quarter of 2008 exceeded our forecasts
4235485 we continue to execute our strategic plan and remain focused to achieve our company wide goal for positive adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2008 we did not anticipate the significant revenue expansion in the june quarter due to the much debated broad based economic slow down affecting our nation notwithstanding we were able to increase our revenue by 44 over the quarter ending june 30th 2007
4235486 our second quarter results were affected by the sudden rise of fuel costs as a result certain key vendors of the company passed these cost increases back to gem through necessitated surcharges
4235487 we are very pleased with the increase in revenue in spite of the economic slow down which indicates our service is meeting the needs of clients furthermore the additional reduction in operating expense matched with the revenue increase allows us to expect positive adjusted ebitda for 2008
4235488 fiscal 2008 saw continued strength in our instrument and optical component product lines it was also a year of extensive investment in technology as we continued to execute the strategic shift from oem products and optical components to higher revenue in line production metrology tools and electro optical assemblies despite significant progress in this transition we were negatively impacted by a reduction in capital spending by our customers in the semiconductor manufacturing and display markets this contributed to a year over year revenue decline of 22 0 million in fiscal 2008 adversely affecting earnings which was clearly a disappointment capital spending in the display sector showed a positive recovery in the latter half of fiscal 2008 and we entered fiscal 2009 with a strong backlog in display
4235489 in fiscal 2008 we made several changes we implemented restructuring programs in the first and fourth quarters as we sized our operations to reflect the changing market conditions manufacturing programs aimed at driving down cost and improving productivity continue to be initiated and we are taking additional measures to offset rising costs for raw materials energy and transportation
4235490 despite the current slowdown in the world economy we expect to achieve sales growth in excess of 10 in fiscal 2009 fueled by increased metrology sales in our display solutions and vision systems groups
4235491 we continue to make progress on multiple fronts in the effort to expand upon our existing presence in the academic research community and to increase our visibility within the commercial market
4235492 during the third quarter our distributor in australia placed their first order for a nano enabler system
4235493 the scientific activity of our customers and the developing applications for our products in the areas of stem cell research neural regeneration and live cell assays give me confidence that there are significant sales opportunities in multiple sectors on the scientific front i am pleased to announce that we have entered into scientific collaboration agreements with two academic research institutions with details to be disclosed at a later date under these collaboration agreements we will be working closely with biologists at both institutions to develop new applications for our systems it is our anticipation that we will enter into additional agreements of this type in the future and that they will lead to the development of exciting new products and applications and ultimately increased revenues and profits for bioforce
4235494 while our results for the second quarter and first half of 2008 were records in terms of revenues gross profit and net income we are not satisfied
4235495 we were pleased to complete a 300 000 convertible debt financing during the second quarter and as previously announced completed a second convertible debt financing also with proceeds of 300 000 in july additional financing is required and we continue to work with multiple parties in this regard
4235496 second quarter 2008 results met our expectations we saw significant improvements in most financial parameters revenue from continuing operations increased by 18 5 for the quarter now up 21 4 for the ytd while both operating income and ebitda showed strong positive results as compared to a loss in the same period last year we added 1 595 customer lines during the quarter for a 425 customer line net gain at the end of the quarter bringing total customer lines in excess of 28 788 an increase of 1 5 including customer churn as compared to q1 of 2008 total line count is now up by 922 for 2008 ytd an increase of 3 3 we continued to face during the second quarter the impact of various non cash items primarily tied to our debt facility which decreased our profitability but are not tied to operating results
4235497 we are very pleased with the 2nd quarter financial results our strong financial performance reflects implementation of our growth strategies in a favorable market environment as china embraces more energy efficient products smartheat stands to benefit greatly from chinas green movement towards clean environment as our efficient energy saving products reduce heat energy use by as much as 50 we look forward to continued execution of our growth plan as we enter two of smartheats strongest quarters

4235528 we had a hint of this reaction before as a previous study we conducted in 96 patients treated with 300 mg of clopidogrel for elective coronary artery stenting showed that 28 of the responders to clopidogrel were smokers compared with 13 of the nonresponders and another study by matetzky et al has reported that smokers were less often clopidogrel resistant
4235529 we didnt really make much of our earlier observation as it was such a small study but then there was an abstract presented at the acc american college of cardiology in 2006 suggesting that smoking appeared to influence the clinical effect of clopidogrel in the credo clopidogrel for the reduction of events during observation study with a larger reduction in clinical events seen with the drug in smokers than in nonsmokers and there has subsequently been an analysis of the clarity pci clopidogrel as adjunctive reperfusion therapy trial showing a similar observation this gave us the interest to look further at our data set
4235530 although there have already been some data suggesting that smoking may affect the response to clopidogrel our findings show that this can be translated into an antiplatelet effect
4235531 our trial is not a prospective study and while we believe our observations are real they are not enough to base clinical decisions on
4235532 in addition the effect of smoking will probably not be a simple formula as its influence will differ from one individual to another i certainly do not suggest people start smoking to get an increased effect from clopidogrel rather this study highlights the limitations of using a prodrug that needs to be metabolized to exert an antiplatelet effect and suggests that a direct acting antiplatelet agent would make more sense
4235533 the guys are playing fantastic cricket theyre playing better and better in every series
4235534 i cant see that the top seven in the batting order will change soon unless someone gets injured all i can do is to make big scores for the cobras
4235535 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4235536 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
4235537 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
4235538 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4235539 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4235540 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4235541 we handed in our presentation to parliamentary committee officials and would write a letter to the committees as well
4235542 the da and white parties must come and apologise you did not want blacks to govern to take charge do not want them to succeed
4235543 shes totally static as a sculptor i dont like that i like to change her
4235544 they start altering her and it becomes much more thoughtful it becomes much more personal and identity oriented
4235545 its much more thoughtful than just putting needles in her eyes
4235546 i wasnt allowed to play with barbie when i was little

4235548 sick to death of hearing the same stories about himself over and over
4235549 he approached me this morning hes tired of this case and wants a postponement to have a rest
4235550 that he was mr delivery and mr intellectual well he failed instantly on both counts
4235551 they kind of think well this guy is pretty compromised and in one sense he will start off under scrutiny
4235552 people will be keeping the lights on and hopefully the microphones and the microscopes pointing in the right direction
4235553 he wont be given a free pass and that can be a helpful thing
4235554 he uses a lot of emotional intelligence which is often better than then intellect because it means he is more plugged in to the concerns of people often in a very positive way
4235555 hes the guy who said that crime is a threat to the constitutional order of south africa and indeed it is
4235556 when we did battle with the current president crime was either contested didnt exist was a figment of the white imagination or indeed the statistics were demonstrably going in the other direction
4235557 no actual recognition that there was a crisis here that had to be wished away or explained away or didnt exist so in that sense hes better
4235558 because the judiciary needs to be squared away for him to get into power
4235559 a fight is going on inside me it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves one wolf represents fear anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies pride and superiority the other wolf stands for joy peace love hope sharing serenity humility kindness benevolence friendship empathy generosity truth compassion and faith this same fight is going on inside of you and every other person too
4235560 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

4235565 budgets have been hijacked by a generation of financial engineers that have used them as remote control devices to manage by the numbers they have turned budgets into fixed performance contracts that force managers at all levels to commit to delivering specified financial outcomes even though many of the variables underpinning those outcomes are beyond their control the annual budgeting process is a trap pressured by fixed targets and performance incentives managers focus on making the numbers instead of making a difference meeting set goals instead of maximizing potential with their compensation at stake managers often resort to deceitful even unethical behavior in the end everybody loses the employee the company and ultimately the customer

4235579 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4235580 decades of fire suppression that allowed unsafe fuel loads to accumulate severe bark beetle infestations that are rapidly decimating trees and ever expanding human settlements in and near forests the result is increasing vulnerability to major fires
4235581 its something that needs to be considered in greenhouse gas emissions inventory as we go forward
4235582 unfortunately many of our policy makers dont seem to have taken that message to heart
4235583 we need to be looking at new policies that look to reduce the human footprint in forest landscapes
4235584 its not just california thats experiencing these problems its throughout the western united states
4235585 take steps to reduce global warming pollution from todays levels by at least 2 percent each year and by 20 percent by 2020 science tells us that this is the only way to hold warming to no more than 2 degrees fahrenheit in the next century
4235586 its hard to say if its something well see replicated in other states
4235587 there is really no point in doing this on small scale

4235594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4235595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4235596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4235597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4235598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4235599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4235605 the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4235606 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4235607 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger

4235616 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
4235617 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
4235618 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
4235619 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
4235620 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4235621 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4235622 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4235623 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4235624 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4235635 doujon zammits tale shocked us all both for the brutal and unfair manner of his loss but also for the generosity subsequently displayed by his father despite his heavy pain

4235658 in the coming weeks amazon ec2 will be launching a new persistent storage offering
4235659 having a really big san storage area network in the cloud
4235660 i was under the apparently false impression that s3 was a high availability service
4235661 it gives them more flexibility to run more apps particularly database applications up in the cloud
4235662 i usually wear shoes with at least three to four inch heels
4235663 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4235664 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4235665 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4235666 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4235667 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4235668 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall

4235672 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4235673 is anyone here really suggesting that we go to war with russia over georgia
4235674 gee these folks came to this country illegally they are neither us nor north carolina citizens they have no right to an education were sorry they brought their kids with them but they kids are in violation of the law and they are all welcome to go back to where they came from and get an education there
4235675 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4235676 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4235677 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4235678 help hello there i have sent this email to the council and arriva arriva was the only that replied but said that i should have gone to the meetings and the dolphin centre i did all this i was told by all of them that we were not losing this bus what a lie can i please give my utter disappointment in the bus changes i live on larchfield street and it was myself with cllr roberts that fought for our bus stop we are all elderly people and needed this bus this bus took us to the town then the hospital willow rd cockerton faverdale onto aycliffe now we have no bus at all i am so angry about this it took me to willow road surgery my doctors but i have to walk over the town now or get a taxi i dont walk far we are all in our late 70 80 this was a good service why they have taken it off it is stupid please can you intervene in this please
4235679 i am heart broken i saw them take down my bus stop in larchfield street this is cruel
4235680 a prenup requiring long term care insurance makes sense for any couple concerned about protecting their assets careers or ways of life
4235681 the bride should be especially concerned since women live longer than men and tend to inherit the care giving chores
4235682 i love the guy but im not signing up to be his nurse or purse
4235683 like millions of other women over 40 sarah knows first hand what caring entails
4235684 she spent countless hours caring for her now deceased stepmother and father and for a friend who died of cancer and now wants a life of her own
4235685 with her husband to be covered by long term care insurance sarahs assets will be protected
4235686 her time and lifestyle will also be protected also she has children and grandchildren whose inheritance will be protected should the need for care materialize she can spend quality time with her husband letting others perform the nursing chores and she can relax knowing that her own financial future will be secure
4235687 by getting married instead of staying single he can get a discount on his long term care policy
4235688 and of course he can also enjoy the benefits sarah enjoys with her policy protection of his own assets and peace of mind knowing he will not burden his children with future care expenses or chores
4235689 he wont have to worry about becoming her nurse or wallet should she require care before he does
4235690 wedding bells should signal wonderful times ahead not cloudy possibilities that can be avoided
4235691 pffffffffffffft oh real cool kid bong you think thats funny grow up
4235692 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4235693 its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4235694 its extremely upsetting to lose all the research i backed everything up on the computer i was almost there i was at the end halfway through the last chapter
4235695 im not sure what to do ive got to get a new machine and get back into it im at a bit of a loss
4235696 yes im seriously ill and im fighting with that ive been managing to do some parts of the biography here and there and im determined to finish it so hopefully this will pull at the heartstrings of the burglars
4235697 weve some pretty good reviews on the capacity of the waikato system
4235698 but the problem with the best laid plans is that nature tends to upset them
4235699 we should be able to have reasonable confidence that well be able to manage the river so the residents continue to feel safe
4235700 changing logos or buying public relations spin will do little to change the lack of affection many amateur fishers feel for the department
4235701 littered with bad process bad science cases of disappearing submissions and a general display of arrogance that has no place in a democracy
4235702 amateur fishers have been the meat in the sandwich too often for our liking with doc vastly over estimating our impacts
4235703 while we all agree the protection of hectors and maui dolphins is essential bans in places that dolphins have never been seen only serves to undermine docs credibility
4235704 far too often those really responsible for major habitat destruction and species decline seem to have got away scott free
4235705 doc have found amateur fishers a much easier target when seeking to create marine conservation areas rather than concentrating on destructive bulk harvesting methods or poor land management where the real damage is done
4235706 there were so many people affected people needed to hear
4235707 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

4235710 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement said ed gjertsen a certified financial planner in glenview ill
4235711 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy said gjertsen vice president of mack investment securities
4235712 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
4235713 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all
4235714 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort he said
4235715 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up said richard salmen vice president and senior adviser at gtrust financial partners in overland park kan
4235716 a bad adviser is going to blow with the wind a little bit more
4235717 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results said david twibell president of wealth management for colorado capital bank in denver
4235718 can be constructed and operated in a manner that minimizes potential impacts and that the benefits of the project clearly outweigh its costs
4235719 if we have an electric department that has an office there are costs that are included in that office the costs are being borne by the entire town because the breakdown is not there
4235720 were not showing the actual expenses its part of the expenses of running the department
4235721 you cant sit there and argue the electric department shouldnt have a rate increase when on the other side you have to fairly show the expenses of the electric department youre getting this fairy tail picture of what you think are the expenses
4235722 this is what the townspeople are going to look at
4235723 if an enterprise comes in and uses our heat utilities water theyre just sitting there for free
4235724 if you look at from a business point of view it makes sense
4235725 americas road home represents a very unique partnership for the convention host committee in that most of our sponsors are for profit organizations
4235726 we have tried very diligently to focus this convention on important national issues such as sustainability and energy and americas road home complements that very nicely with their own message of hope for families in need in addition with denver being a leader in homelessness initiatives it is a great way to tie an important message on a national level with a city that has been at the forefront of developing solutions
4235727 there are 600 000 homeless families in the u s representing about 1 5 million children yet the average american has no idea the size of the issue
4235728 our challenge and our goal is to bring awareness to the issue and to compel consumers to give to the cause we think we can accomplish this goal by leveraging the national stage offered to us by the events of the dnc and rnc in order to engage the country and our political leaders in a dialogue about family homelessness in addition we want to be sure that people know there is an issue and that we can provide a way for them to give because the truth is that if we all work together at the 5 and 10 level we can actually put an end to family homelessness in our lifetime
4235729 the least expensive way to own a cell phone in america
4235730 its important for hr managers recruiters and other decision makers working at these large companies to realize that job seekers dont just go to a job board to find a job
4235731 they go to a board like hotjobs to look at the weather report like a barometer that indicates whats happening in the job market its critical for all companies to be represented on a list like this so people realize that even in this environment people are hiring
4235732 the goal is to encourage job seekers when there is so much negative talk out there we are trying to give them hope despite all these dark clouds
4235733 a customer who complains is doing you a great service
4235734 hey i really dont know anything about the reason for the preemption im as disappointed as all of you are ill try to find out some more info and post more as soon as i know more

4235764 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
4235765 the obama campaign has had zero policy prescriptions for dealing with the most serious global crisis since the iraq war
4235766 it made obama look like a deer caught in the headlights the mccain campaign was way ahead of him by advocating a serious and multi layered global diplomatic response
4235767 mccain certainly impresses me with the way he has handled it
4235768 it vindicates the somewhat tougher line toward the russians that he has advocated mccain is the one who has distinguished himself here
4235769 is senator obama your choice for president or are you a racist
4235770 the real subtext of the ad was to paint obama as a featherweight figure whose fame is undeserving the result of natural gifts as opposed to hard work or skill
4235771 the government has become a major employer causing a lot of economic problems for the country
4235772 the government has got involved in many economic activities ahmadinejad has turned the economy into a fully state dominated economy
4235773 when ahmadinejad was elected the leader asked us to tolerate his economic policies but after three years the era of tolerating the government on carrying out privatization has ended
4235774 the government still controls many key industries giving control of sectors to semi governmental organizations does not mean privatization
4235775 repeating his call for a windfall profits tax on companies like exxon mobil which he singled out in his speech on monday mr obama said he would use part of the tax to provide consumers with an emergency energy rebate of 1 000 per family
4235776 but rebates on utility bills thats nonsense what weve now got is a large and complex and expensive dont forget system whereby we discourage people from using energy by taxing it and then encourage them to use energy by subsidising them to do so quite insane

4235786 this is going to be more than just a parking lot
4235787 its going to be a multi use venue for everyone to come to today is the start of the remodernization of the downtown area
4235788 i remember a bustling hotel with bellhops and people moving all around this spot
4235789 growing up the hotel was always busy and it was a sad day to see it go
4235790 i think this new project will be a source of pride for owosso we needed to get something here and this certainly is a good step
4235791 we will begin the walk of history and other projects this summer and by 2010 we want to begin to repair washington street
4235792 there was a bunch of stuff online about different historical tour de frances and a bunch of stuff about the past doping scandal but nothing about this year i did find one thing that was a picture of a cat sitting on a bicycle seat and i made that my desktop image because i just think its so cute but yeah really nothing on the 2008 tour
4235793 theyre pretty good at riding bikes and you know doping but maybe it was an american i mean floyd landis was good at doping right i just wish there was some way to figure this out

4235806 its going to be similar to text messaging it caught on first with younger people and now its propagating through the age segments
4235807 i have no proof so i cant make an affirmation
4235808 its unfair that people keep saying the chinese are too young to compete
4235809 if they think they can tell someones age just by looking at them well if you look at the foreign athletes they have so much more muscles than the chinese they are so strong do you then say that they are doping

4235824 yes i know i know you dont want to hear that

4235826 the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4235827 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4235828 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger

4235841 president musharraf is being forced out by a ruling coalition government which includes parties such as the pakistan peoples party of late prime minister benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league nawaz of former prime minister nawaz sharif these parties have been sworn enemies in pakistan and have come together only for the cause of opposing musharraf
4235842 what would hold such parties together once president musharraf is gone would they parties then squabble amongst themselves
4235843 if the military remains neutral then there is a chance that political parties will learn to become more mature over a period of time and we wont have petty infighting of the kind which has broken parties and political alliances in the past
4235844 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4235845 i take senator bayh at his word that he may not recall this high profile committee that garnered lots of press attention and had mccain lieberman scheunemann james woolsey and others attached but then i think that the senator owes us an explanation of how his staff signed him up for this or how it happened
4235846 a few hundred dollars is a small investment that can protect boaters from a much larger expense and hassle associated with damaging a propeller or rudder
4235847 we sell lights daily to frustrated and concerned fisherman and boaters who simply want to avoid taking damage to their boat from crab pots we offer several products that will aid boaters in avoiding these obstacles including a wide range of remote controlled lights with halogen bulbs and recently we just introduced our high intensity discharge hid golight remote controlled spotlights while our standard golight strykers produce a working beam of 800 feet we offer a hid golight stryker with a working beam of 1800 feet hid golights like the gl 3049h and gl 3067h give fisherman and boaters more opportunities to identify buoys crab pots logs and markers before they get on top of them
4235848 we also offer a full line of high intensity discharge boat lights some measuring a full 6 inches square and producing 4500 lumens of intense white light in both spot and flood patterns now that we offer these lights in white the hid 66 is a hot item we also developed a full line of rail mount solutions including our bc 1 mount that are ideal for mounting golights and hid lights right to the rails on the boats this makes for an easy install and enables the boater to position the light right over the water for maximum beam utilization we offer a range of intense led emitter light bars that are ideal for illuminating areas onboard or around the boat with soft bright white light these have proven useful for docking backward illumination and onboard area lights finally our explosion proof fluorescent lights originally designed for oil rigs paint booths and petrochemical plants have become popular with shipyards and large boats who need explosion proof surface mount lights since our explosion proof fluorescent lights are marine approved for waterproof requirements they are suitable for boats and ships as well

4235869 i just dont think weve handed it in i think my managers are holding on to it to wait to find out whats going on
4235870 to be honest im not one hundred percent sure were still talking as far as i know
4235871 i hope elitexc can make it happen oct 4 because then im in
4235872 it would be a big honor to fight for the elitexc title especially against such a great champion

4235874 the primary and general election seasons have seen a marathon of news reporting on the candidates thus far both campaigns seem obsessed with convincing the electorate that their candidate would be the better commander in chief for the military but which candidate better understands the importance of preserving freedom of the press
4235875 the framers of the constitution championed a free and vigorous press declaring that it is essential for citizens to make informed decisions about the future of the republic
4235876 are we better informed today than we were eight years ago if not we are largely to blame for a lack of information we need to get serious about holding whoever takes the presidential oath in the future accountable the constitution depends on it
4235877 despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama

4235887 this causes great concern as it is not clear whose orders the russian troops are executing and why russia does not honour the declared ceasefire
4235888 a vast mission of peacekeepers observers and other monitors who will record the illegal actions by russian troops
4235889 georgias territorial integrity and the withdrawal of the occupation army must be the main objectives to be pursued by the international community after military actions are discontinued
4235890 serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
4235891 this is our commitment we will give all our support to the political task to missions and any tasks which the european union may ask of us
4235892 the eu must have a leadership role in the search for peace and stability beyond its borders in all of europe and we can demand that russia contribute to stability through dialogue and understanding
4235893 we must criticise what needs to be criticised and we have done this in the past including with clear words when necessary towards russia with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia proper
4235894 but we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region if the eu wants to help in the stabilisation of a crisis hit region then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow
4235895 we will see whether we can also offer german citizens if there is a need for personnel
4235896 the aim is to enable every vacationer to choose the cruise that is exactly right for individual tastes interests and budget
4235897 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4235898 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4235899 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals

4235917 reading is a wonderful way to get acquainted with other cultures especially minor ones
4235918 it is my hope that this reading and discussion series graciously funded by nextbook and the jewish studies program at asu will open the door and the hearts to the fascinating multiethnic culture that is growing in phoenix
4235919 the delicate often tortuous relationship between neighboring cultures animates these works of history and fiction which trace the jewish experience from muslim spain to bolshevik russia to contemporary america
4235920 neighbors the destruction of the jewish community in jedwabne poland
4235921 they deal with minority identities and minority majority relations in diverse societies
4235922 they cover a wide range of historical settings from the violent revolutionary bolshevik russia of isaac babels short stories to polish jewish relations during the second world war to gish jens contemporary novel of a new chinese jewishness in new york suburbs
4235923 as a group of readings they constitute a powerful exploration of how literature can promote the human understanding and respect that underwrites a good civil society
4235924 ethnic literatures produce some of the most compelling reading available on library and bookstore shelves today so i hope series participants will continue on reading jewish and other vibrant ethnic literary traditions

4235976 the number of dead zones has approximately doubled each decade since the 1960s
4235977 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4235978 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4235979 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4235980 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4235981 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4235982 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries

4235986 students need them if they want to get a job somewhere
4235987 no one does laundry as often as they think they will and you just cant run out of the essentials
4235988 a college or university only insures the building not a students personal belongings such as clothes books and electronics so they should be sure they have insurance to cover such things
4235989 students usually bring everything they own and find that once they get here that they do not have enough space for it all
4235990 a student may know more than the average incoming student about the campus but they still wont know it all as policies activities and living arrangements change yearly so be patient ask questions and listen
4235991 freshmen need to understand that the collegiate experience is a wonderful time to meet and interact with people who are different than they are it may be the first time they are asked to communicate their opinion wants and needs to someone else in a constructive way
4235992 being open to new and different ideas can be a little scary at first but the benefit of listening to another perspective will be invaluable in a students development

4236016 technology consulting firms like ours used to get paid when computers broke down
4236017 now more and more our franchise owners are telling us clients prefer to pay a predictable monthly bill to keep computers healthy
4236018 those smaller businesses are actually the ones that can least afford to have computer trouble
4236019 little guys really depend on all their staff being productive all the time we fix everything from virus infections to server crashes
4236020 we want to eliminate computer problems so that our small businesses can stop worrying about when their next computer problem will be and instead let us show them how they can enhance their businesses with new technologies
4236021 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4236022 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4236023 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4236024 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4236025 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4236026 most of the effects of low oxygen on fish stocks are what we call sub lethal
4236027 it doesnt kill the fish but stresses them it affects their growth it reduces their reproductive output and makes them more susceptible to disease
4236028 if youve been tired for three weeks straight your body is trying to tell you something is wrong
4236029 change your attitude change your diet change your exercise habits and change your supplements
4236030 i think the judge was extremely fair under all the circumstances
4236031 i think under all circumstances it was a fair disposition and so does aaron
4236032 he couldve gotten i dont know we figured out 27 years or something like that the judge couldve given him
4236033 i understand the difference between regret and remorse i do not regret being caught as much as i have remorse in my heart for what ive done i know that i have a debt to pay to society and i stand here ready to pay it
4236034 he wasnt saying oh im sorry i was arrested he wasnt saying that hes saying i have remorse and i have ruined my life and thats what i have remorse about
4236035 was he doing something criminal of course he was thats what hes being sentences for
4236036 but he really just did choose the wrong group of friends and he was totally cooperative with the federal authorities from day one
4236037 in order to pay taxes and have the opportunity to have lower taxes you have to have a job and john mccains plan is a plan which is dedicated to preserving the small businesses that have created 283 000 jobs in an economy that is struggling
4236038 barack obamas plans are plans which would damage small business in ways that are quite dramatic
4236039 portland is a critical first step in our groups expansion plan
4236040 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii in general
4236041 but if its not a good game it doesnt sell that flood of crap will die down as publishers become more coherent the wii is a great opportunity for hitting hardcore gamers no one is doing that
4236042 it has come to my attention that there are recent reports circulating regarding my daughter i would like to take this oppurtunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety
4236043 la idea de escribir teatro me rondaba desde antes como la de ser poeta o novelista y acaso m s que estas dos ltimas
4236044 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4236045 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4236046 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4236047 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4236048 uhh eve ohh yeah uh oh yeah thats hot baby
4236049 its so fucking big i love sucking your cock dylan
4236050 want me to do it again i can go longer
4236051 look do you want to get together i think we should talk about last night i have a fianc and you are dating angel this could really get nasty
4236052 sure jade i would be happy too where would you like to meet
4236053 jade where is your fianc i dont want to create anymore trouble for you
4236054 i dont care where your fianc is tonight because we both know that you would not have called me unless he was not around and we both know that you want my cock but what you dont know it that i am going to fuck you in the ass until you screams you little stuck up singer
4236055 he is out of town on a job tonight ill see you at joes
4236056 no worries i was glad to come so what do you want to talk about
4236057 well about last night that was kind of weird i shouldnt have done what i did either with you or to you everything just kind of got out of hand dont you agree
4236058 she wants me to let her off the hook and say it was my fault she wants me to let her have a clear conscious by saying i was responsible if i give into her then this evening will end with a drink right here but if i make her be responsible for herself i will be in between her thighs inside of an hour
4236059 no jade i dont i think everyone did what they wanted to do last night and i dont see any reason to apologize for it i wanted to try and fuck you and i did try anywhere along the way you could said no and meant it and i would have stopped trying i saw you in mistys dressing room touching yourself while i fucked her i think you wanted me to try and i think you enjoyed the game until i embarrassed you with the microphone bit so if that was the only reason that you called me then i will be going now
4236060 your place i am sure that you are closer than me
4236061 catch me if you can and maybe there will be more
4236062 this neighborhood is really hard to park in and didnt want to have to come back
4236063 as to looking at whether or not it will be an attachment or built in were always looking at how hardware should evolve and where we should take it
4236064 unfortunately i dont have a definite direction to give you today but its something well be looking at
4236065 it might be good to keep it as an attachment we only use for certain software
4236066 of course you always want more and as we were working on we thought it would be nice to have more than what we had
4236067 how do i pwn thee let me count the ways
4236068 there is no rule that says that if the chip doesnt work they will refuse you access to the border you will get increased scrutiny but its still a valid document
4236069 so liberal application of a hammer can negate a lot of the possible
4236070 we want to help people make an informed decision at the time of purchasing
4236071 obviously we have an epidemic of obesity across the nation and
4236072 its new york if its loud and noisy and youre in a hurry and the kids are crying who is going to stop and read the calories
4236073 i may put 15 pepperoni on a pie someone else may put 12 we dont measure the amount of cheese we put on
4236074 if you put up roundabout numbers how does that help anyone
4236075 the stores are all calling and asking for information we dont have it
4236076 these are small stores they are barely making a profit
4236077 some economists dont think much of my gas tax holiday
4236078 but the american people like it and so do small business owners
4236079 because the trust fund is already looking at a looming shortfall it would have moved project cancellations into the construction season
4236080 im not going to let the senate spend all this money when nobody is looking especially when we refuse to stop wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on earmarks
4236081 is the cornerstone nothing else will work without the underpinning of the higher user fee gas tax
4236082 i knew i wanted to buy it right when it came out but i didnt have an opportunity to
4236083 at that time you could buy the phone without signing a contract
4236084 obama promised us that if he becomes a president in the future he will support and help afghanistan not only in its security sector but also in reconstruction development and economic sector
4236085 theres nothing approaching a description of spending cuts that will finance this deficit and that means youre gonna have to pay for those tax cuts in the future with higher tax rates
4236086 leave their tax rates at or below where they were in the 1990s
4236087 barack obamas plan would cut taxes for middle class families and when you take the entire tax proposal as a whole would cut taxes as a whole to less than 18 2 of gdp
4236088 thats lower than the level of taxes when ronald reagan was president
4236089 the mccain campaign is relying on a vote for a baucus amendment to the budget resolution that john mccain voted for as well
4236090 organizations like the committee for a responsible federal budget said the amendment was not a tax increase and that would have in fact cut taxes on middle class families
4236091 impose a 3 6 trillion tax increase over 10 years on workers
4236092 heyhey homeksillies click pages 2 the right 2 find out about me
4236093 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing

4236100 not only was roshown an outstanding player but he is a very good coach who has been a student of the game for a long time
4236101 his ability to teach the game adjust quickly on his feet to different circumstances and to make players better were very apparent in the process of getting to know him he will be a tremendous mentor to our team but especially to our inside players
4236102 this is a great opportunity for myself and my family
4236103 indiana is the cream of the crop when you talk about great college basketball tradition
4236104 i watched him throughout his career as a high school college and nba player and ive always been impressed with him
4236105 as ive gotten to know him ive realized that we have mutual acquaintances and friends and the people that he has played for i hold in high regard and have great respect for
4236106 in all likelihood if roshown wouldve been able to stay healthy he would still be a player in the nba
4236107 when that wasnt an option anymore he followed his heart and got involved in many different aspects of coaching basketball whether at the collegiate level the high school level or inside of the summers his personality is very engaging and outgoing and he has built up many outstanding relationships already in the basketball world with many more to come
4236108 most importantly i think our fans will respect how hard he works and the energy that he has
4236109 we are really excited that roshown and tiffani are with us
4236110 you just think youve seen horses im gonna show you a horse
4236111 we wanted to work together so that it was a mixture of our styles weve always appreciated each others aesthetic so we thought it would be quite a fun idea to combine the two
4236112 our september theme was excess i think working together we felt more confident to pull off slightly more outlandish styling ideas like mono brows im sure some people will love them and some people will hate them we love them
4236113 cato van ee was an exclusive to prada and miu miu this season as soon as i saw her on the runway she made it on my casting wishlist for the season i shot her for the august issue of dazed and was so impressed she moved so well in front of the camera and is just a real pleasure to shoot
4236114 the casting included girls at different stages of the new faces cycle last season kori richardson climbed to the top and is set for another successful season shes already a real pro and required very little direction from either will karen or myself she just gets it
4236115 whereas pernille is brand new shes only just started and is at the beginning of a very exciting time she walked in as a timid 16 year old but when we dressed her up gave her red lips and put her in front of the camera she became a completely different person
4236116 along with kori anna is also slightly more experienced than both cato and pernille although it was a new faces project it was really good to draw on the experience that anna could bring to the shoot shes also a master of getting the miu miu balaclavas on and off
4236117 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4236118 do you even have to ask of course i do
4236119 i love mixed media and an art i call whimsical fancy a mixture of fun and detailed work that brings on a smile no matter what mood youre in
4236120 it is a medium that is very forgiving and easy to work with if your sculpture isnt working for you take away or add more
4236121 i love to believe that i am self taught its an inner passion no matter what medium the artist is assuming
4236122 sei sicuro che non sei tu quello che ne ha voglia
4236123 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
4236124 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
4236125 longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
4236126 do you see websites posting tracklistings for any other albums
4236127 no you dont build pinatas you raise them yes like a farm animal
4236128 online security is one of the most important realities facing our industry today
4236129 the ncftas collective approach provides an excellent opportunity to address these issues in a comprehensive way and on an industry wide basis bell is happy to play a role in this important initiative
4236130 i got a letter in the mail that basically said if you want to take the pills we will help you get that from the doctor and we will stand there and watch you die but we wont give you the medication to live
4236131 news of payment denial is tough enough for a terminally ill person to bear
4236132 if it makes you smile then i did my job right
4236133 its kind of exciting to think where it will take me next
4236134 ive found the internet to be a wonderful source of inspiration as well as books and magazines
4236135 zne has been a valuable source for me the interaction with other members is important and the feedback i get really gives me that much needed boost we artists crave
4236136 they start as soft sculpture but then i add clay features that give them personality and bring them to life
4236137 informiamo i signori viaggiatori che il treno regionale delle ore 7 45 proveniente da venezia s lucia diretto a bologna centrale ha maturato 25 minuti di ritardo ci scusiamo per linconveniente

4236140 cuando me preguntaban antes a que me dedicaba o donde vivia les decia que era profesor y que ense ama literatura en el instituto thomas alba edison y que entrenaba al equipo de baseball en primavera y que vivia en una peque a ciudad al sur de pensylvania y todos me decian vaya tiene sentido pero aqui parece ser un gran misterio
4236141 indigenous artists are being ripped off they are vulnerable theyre being exploited and yet we bask in the glory of indigenous arts when were offshore and i think that is quite a disgraceful thing
4236142 37 million is a much smaller amount than what is needed and much lower than what that senate inquiry demanded
4236143 i think im a combination of self taught and informal training
4236144 were talking about buildings or sites of national heritage significance and we have a number in tasmania
4236145 but the concern is actually national that we only have such a small amount 200 000 in fact comparable to the amount that say local government in tasmania is contributing to heritage within their own municipality
4236146 if youre a woman working in the public service youre better off working in an agency where the majority of employees are men and youre better off working in a larger agency because it seems to dictate the pay levels
4236147 its not about work value its about the size of the agency and whether your agency has the capacity to pay fair wage increases or not
4236148 he is doing the tests in his lab at ornl through his affiliation with the forensics anthropology center
4236149 dr vass is an expert in the sort of unique chemicals that are produced by decomposing bodies
4236150 i think barack obama has that unique influence to get people on the same page and moving in the same direction
4236151 i think everybody in this country knows were one car crash or one disease away from ruining our families
4236152 i think barack obama has that unique influence to get people on the same page and moving in the same direction
4236153 at a press conference just now john mccain redoubled his efforts to thrust himself into a leadership role on the russia georgia crisis front announcing that two top campaign surrogates joe lieberman and lindsey graham are going on a visit to georgia
4236154 i think barack obama has that unique influence to get people on the same page and moving in the same direction
4236155 who the obama campaign wanted filling the seats of invesco field
4236156 i think everybody in this country knows were one car crash or one disease away from ruining our families
4236157 after all ive done for you this is how you repay me
4236158 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4236159 not to get attached to any obsolete idea of who i am what i represent whom i belong to or what function i may once have served
4236160 one must always be prepared for riotous and endless waves of transformation
4236161 no solo capaz de detener el deterioro neuronal si no que cura favoreciendo la regeneracion de algunas neuronas
4236162 we believe that missile defense is a susbstantial contribution to natos
4236163 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4236164 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4236165 six books walk into a bar five of them have a great time they hang out have a drink but inevitably they go home alone one bags two hot coeds that book is the core
4236166 the democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
4236167 strongly and unequivocally supports roe vs wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4236168 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
4236169 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4236170 i do think that those who diminish the moral elements of the decision arent expressing the full reality of it
4236171 the driver navigator and chief mechanic on the hillary hate bus

4236195 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer

4236212 not bad for a music festival that has no budget
4236213 in general the arts are undervalued in this country and nearly everywhere and we are too far under the radar to attract the angels who lavish their money on sanctified projects like the symphony and opera
4236214 to my initial surprise most of the edgiest works this year were submitted by women upon reflection this makes sense perhaps guys bruised by the sexual revolution are less sure of themselves probably a good thing so we have dedicated the entire oct 4 show saturday to sexually themed works by female artists the temperature ranges from subtly evocative to sensual to outrageous
4236215 confessions is my way of sharing my life and my art exposing my most intimate moments confessions is me vulnerable and bare my musical diary my musical blog
4236216 i relate two key characters to my persona pierrot the misunderstood struggling artist and victim of unrequited love his inappropriate behaviour makes him ridiculous in part i am also columbine the muse and coquettish lover an archetype of female sexuality
4236217 we have a preference for unusual themes be they risky quirky polemic or just weird
4236218 i have been intrigued for some time now by the mechanics of seduction are there elements intrinsic to certain genres of music that can be said to symbolize the psychological dance of seduction that mirror the same neurological systems responses and patterns it occurred to me that belly dancing might be a place to look since it represents an on going empirical experiment in the subject this piece is the result a rather clinical view of sexuality i realize and im not sure if it registers as sexy per se but it was a blast to create and to research
4236219 putting together the festival this year has taught me that there is a huge reluctance to discuss almost all matters of sexuality and i find that compelling why are we so shy about sex maybe because it necessarily involves a high degree of vulnerability most of us are on shaky ground when it comes to the art of love maybe im just speaking for myself but i suspect that most people do not consider themselves experts far from it we stumble into relationships marriage and children without ever quite realizing what we are up to or how we got there and relegate prowess to movie stars and other mythical creatures of our fantasy who need not dedicate their evanescent selves to daily practice in diaper changing getting up for work or struggling against their inner quiet desperation
4236220 i will admit it was quite bizarre to direct my wife in how to make love but its difficult whether youre married to a person or not

4236240 i grew the mustache because a coach in college said i couldnt grow one
4236241 when i went to the olympics i had every intention of shaving the mustache off but i realized i was getting so many comments about it and everybody was talking about it that i decided to keep it i had some fun with a russian coach who asked me if my mustache slowed me down i said no as a matter of fact it deflects water away from my mouth allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet shaped in the water and thats what had allowed me to swim so great hes translating as fast as he can for the other coaches and the following year every russian male swimmer had a mustache
4236242 well one im not swimming anymore two it started to turn gray and three my wife had never seen me nor my family without the mustache im happy without it

4236260 we all got onto the aircraft we were all seated in our seats and everything and then we got a message
4236261 the person just popped up and said im sorry everyone will have to de board there is an engineering problem
4236262 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4236263 suddenly the commissioner had a daughter and she was brought into the comics
4236264 i cant help but think it would have an effect and if you look at the comics they draw him more like the movie version now with the armor little things start to seep back and forth on both sides its like with spider man when he first came out he didnt have the webshooters automatically he invented those but in the movie he shot the web right from his body marvel then told the writers thats the way its supposed to be done in the comics from now on dc hasnt done that they let it happen more organically
4236265 youre building on everything thats been done before so when youre coming to batman youre standing on the shoulders of frank miller grant morrison jeph loeb and the list goes on and on chris nolan did an extraordinary job and the guys doing the monthly comics are doing the same thing in their own fashion the essence of batman doesnt change in the process but its the version that works for the medium youre in what heath did to the joker you couldnt do in print the facial expressions the body language how his body twitched that was the magic of film will it influence how its done in the comics im sure in some fashion will it be replicated no
4236266 it reminded me of the first batman murderer story by len wein when they smashed the bat signal and he goes on the run because hes framed for murder mine was more like bruce wayne himself is framed whats batman like when he cant be bruce wayne i always did like the idea that hes against the law the bat signal is a great idea but the cops constantly calling on batman come on hes a vigilante it makes more sense that the cops would be after him people died when he was stopping crimes
4236267 batman fugitive has been done but as a short story but to set it up as his status quo no ones ever done that before the sense of responsibility i have to do this for gotham because they need that thats almost a spider man thing except now its for harveys legacy to endure he has to step into this role why have they never thought to do that before and you explore why does he run because we have to chase him it really does make me want to write batman fugitive how do you not see that movie and want to write batman now
4236268 you cant take batman and say batmans going to do a tap dance and eat a ham and cheese batman doesnt say hey everybody lets go have a picnic thats not what batman does the authors job isnt to show whats there but youve always known was there but never thought about i never liked the fugitive part if the joker is killing people left and right blame the murders on him in this case i felt the authors presence it was there because it was setting something up it made no sense but i accepted it because the movie was cool
4236269 i like the idea of batman being taken down by someone someone really targeting him now that hes vulnerable it would be good to see them work with that
4236270 it makes me want to write a third part of the story that i did with long halloween and dark victory if i had any control over it i would go back and rename dark victory the long halloween ii like how george lucas made star wars the fourth one for a new hope so this would be the long halloween iii if the first story was about the transition between when the freaks took over from the crime families and the second was about the destruction of that family ending when theyre completely in power the third would be whether or not organized crime could rise up again and what that would cost batmans city it puts batman in a really interesting place which is more in the interest of the public good so the third story would be more one of hope he may not ever be able to complete his task but if he inspires someone to do the job he does and thats a good thing batman stories can get really bleak when you get down to it so this would make sense of it all

4236288 in an attempt to be cost effective reductions in costs leave two choices either staffing or supplies become the focus making packaging easier to use saves time and increases efficiency providing more time to care for patients we sometimes wish package designers could be in the or to see how difficult it can be to use packaging and maintain sterility
4236289 packaging is a key to maintaining the sterility of products
4236290 i personally believe that procedural kits save time and promote efficiency
4236291 its important to make it safe for both the patients and for healthcare providers healthcare facilities can be a dangerous environment where physical harm is possible from the use of sharps the passing of diseases through blood and body fluids moving heavy equipment and even moving and safely positioning patients
4236292 the purpose of the survey was to gain a better understanding of what nurses go through to get feedback and to make packaging better and easier for end users
4236293 during a procedure a single sterile barrier package is acceptable as long as it maintains device sterility

4236315 second quarter 2008 results met our expectations we saw significant improvements in most financial parameters revenue from continuing operations increased by 18 5 for the quarter now up 21 4 for the ytd while both operating income and ebitda showed strong positive results as compared to a loss in the same period last year we added 1 595 customer lines during the quarter for a 425 customer line net gain at the end of the quarter bringing total customer lines in excess of 28 788 an increase of 1 5 including customer churn as compared to q1 of 2008 total line count is now up by 922 for 2008 ytd an increase of 3 3 we continued to face during the second quarter the impact of various non cash items primarily tied to our debt facility which decreased our profitability but are not tied to operating results
4236316 the results for the second quarter of 2008 provide the third consecutive quarter of continued improvements over the same period for the previous year gems revenue for the second quarter of 2008 exceeded our forecasts
4236317 we continue to execute our strategic plan and remain focused to achieve our company wide goal for positive adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2008 we did not anticipate the significant revenue expansion in the june quarter due to the much debated broad based economic slow down affecting our nation notwithstanding we were able to increase our revenue by 44 over the quarter ending june 30th 2007
4236318 our second quarter results were affected by the sudden rise of fuel costs as a result certain key vendors of the company passed these cost increases back to gem through necessitated surcharges
4236319 we are very pleased with the increase in revenue in spite of the economic slow down which indicates our service is meeting the needs of clients furthermore the additional reduction in operating expense matched with the revenue increase allows us to expect positive adjusted ebitda for 2008
4236320 we continue to make progress on multiple fronts in the effort to expand upon our existing presence in the academic research community and to increase our visibility within the commercial market
4236321 during the third quarter our distributor in australia placed their first order for a nano enabler system
4236322 the scientific activity of our customers and the developing applications for our products in the areas of stem cell research neural regeneration and live cell assays give me confidence that there are significant sales opportunities in multiple sectors on the scientific front i am pleased to announce that we have entered into scientific collaboration agreements with two academic research institutions with details to be disclosed at a later date under these collaboration agreements we will be working closely with biologists at both institutions to develop new applications for our systems it is our anticipation that we will enter into additional agreements of this type in the future and that they will lead to the development of exciting new products and applications and ultimately increased revenues and profits for bioforce
4236323 while our results for the second quarter and first half of 2008 were records in terms of revenues gross profit and net income we are not satisfied
4236324 we were pleased to complete a 300 000 convertible debt financing during the second quarter and as previously announced completed a second convertible debt financing also with proceeds of 300 000 in july additional financing is required and we continue to work with multiple parties in this regard

4236332 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4236333 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4236334 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4236335 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4236336 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

4236343 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4236344 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance

4236346 fiscal 2008 saw continued strength in our instrument and optical component product lines it was also a year of extensive investment in technology as we continued to execute the strategic shift from oem products and optical components to higher revenue in line production metrology tools and electro optical assemblies despite significant progress in this transition we were negatively impacted by a reduction in capital spending by our customers in the semiconductor manufacturing and display markets this contributed to a year over year revenue decline of 22 0 million in fiscal 2008 adversely affecting earnings which was clearly a disappointment capital spending in the display sector showed a positive recovery in the latter half of fiscal 2008 and we entered fiscal 2009 with a strong backlog in display
4236347 in fiscal 2008 we made several changes we implemented restructuring programs in the first and fourth quarters as we sized our operations to reflect the changing market conditions manufacturing programs aimed at driving down cost and improving productivity continue to be initiated and we are taking additional measures to offset rising costs for raw materials energy and transportation
4236348 despite the current slowdown in the world economy we expect to achieve sales growth in excess of 10 in fiscal 2009 fueled by increased metrology sales in our display solutions and vision systems groups

4236387 i can tell seeing as how youre on im talking to me
4236388 crude oils pulling back has taken the pressure out of the inflation picture this translates to a natural rebound in equities
4236389 the market is really looking through the inflation data this morning which was quite scary on a headline basis and taking a more forward looking view that the inflation pressures are likely to be easing
4236390 it feels good it is the same game the biggest difference is the stadiums are a lot bigger than the california league
4236391 i want to hit all the time and i do good hitting and bring more offensively to catching
4236392 i am trying something new at catcher and catching is more different this is my second year playing catcher last year i started to get comfortable and now i am getting more comfortable and love catching
4236393 he has ten home runs already so he is on pace for a 30 home run season at 18 years old very strong and is relatively versatile we are not sure if he is going to be an infielder or an outfielder but we are going to try and exhaust infield at this point he probably has some of the best raw power in our organization when you see him it is even more fun because he is only 185 pounds still he has a big frame to grow into and a lot of strength to come he is playing in major league ballparks in the gcl and with ten home runs through a 100 some at bats the quick math says that is well above average power
4236394 its fun to read about these guys and follow them for a couple weeks throughout the trade discussions and then see it come to life when you get your hands on them and get to see them play and talk to the individuals santana has really been incredible and he really stands out in the carolina league he loves to throw the ball behind the plate he throws behind runners and he already has thrown out a few runners he is at least an average or above average receiver he has a great passion for catching and loves to take charge and really that is exceptional to see from a guy who is just learning a second language you can tell he is a leader and he doesnt have to do it with words as quite frankly at this point he cant offensively he is really impressive he has power discipline and a great feel for the bat there are just some guys who find the sweet part of the bat more often and he is one of them he is just a true hitter and really a promising piece we have added to the system he is lean and is not a huge guy but he is very athletic with a lot of strength he is a guy who is somewhat traditional and from here id say he goes to double a next year plays in triple a and at that point we will determine where we are as a major league team i think he is probably two years away from being considered a major league ready player
4236395 you know rondon is a guy that just turned 20 years old and is up to 96 mph he loves to compete with the fastball on the plate almost too much we are challenging him to throw more changeups and use his secondary pitches more and that is usually a good sign when we have to do that because a lot of young pitchers will try to start to learn how to manipulate the ball that they need to throw more breaking balls and changeups and that usually stems from not having confidence in their fastball hector clearly has confidence in his fastball it is a very good fastball and he still has tons of projection is still growing and has not reached his ceiling yet statistically he is one of the top five pitchers in the league probably one of the best pitchers in the league at 19 20 years old
4236396 you know beau has had a really great year he really has and he expects more out of himself he has had a 900 ops year and he has hit a bunch of home runs and is playing a great first base he has done everything we have expected of him and i think there is even more offense in there we just want to make sure that he has made all the adjustments he needs to make before he gets that promotion he is already advancing at a relatively good clip so there is not a ton of pressure to get him out of kinston
4236397 he has been a pleasant surprise thats for sure anyone who has had that kind of increase in their production is a nice surprise i think it is a couple of things with niuman one is his maturity from a human standpoint in growing up and respecting what it means to be consistent as a human being and to come to the park with the same energy everyday and then his physical maturation those two things occurring at the same time have created more offensive production he has always been a consistent defensive player and i think now he just has more confidence in his bat
4236398 he may have more power potential than any of our young hitters he really hits the ball a long way in batting practice and doesnt have to generate his power he just has some natural strength in his bat and he plays a premium position and does it pretty well he just turned 20 years old and really when you watch the major league shortstops around the game he is easy to project as a future major league shortstop
4236399 he had one tough outing so far in kinston but he has competed well he hasnt had the best support behind him as i think in one game he had some tough breaks defensively he has plus secondary pitches and is a 65
4236400 i definitely dont have the velocity that i used to have as i am sitting 88 89 mph where last year i was 92 94 mph
4236401 its getting there it is still kind of weak in a certain area but we are still working on it just trying to get it better
4236402 i would just pound the zone and throw it down the middle and it would go to both sides of the plate you dont know where it will go and it is my out pitch i dont have it right now so i have to throw my slider and changeup a little more effectively it moves but i dont see it moving as much it is a little bit flatter but also at four mph faster you kind of get away with a lot of things that i cant get away with now if i throw it down the pipe now it is going to hit when before at 93 94 i might get a swing and miss or get them to roll over on it
4236403 i have pretty much had to learn to just go out and pitch
4236404 it has definitely made my offspeed pitch a little bit better as i have had to throw that more for strikes to make my fastball more effective
4236405 ill probably end up going to instructs to get healthy and get some innings
4236406 ill definitely work my ass off this off season to get this thing better it is going to be a long off season theyll probably send me to get some innings somewhere since i have only been here for half a season
4236407 he has worked through a few things as far as trying to solidify his delivery a little bit at times he gets a little sloppy with his delivery but he has an ability to attack hitters and he has learned things about his secondary pitches his slider has come a long way and is becoming more of a weapon where before it was more show his changeup has improved and i think the combination of all that with the maturity he has gone through as far as seeing the success he can have with his fastball command and being able to throw his secondary pitches for strikes has allowed him to get more swing and misses with his fastball his velocity is more consistent from i think the consistency with his delivery and controlling his effort level we are starting to see the 93 and 94s more consistently at the bottom of the zone whereas earlier in the year wed see those numbers but they would be underneath and up at the top of the zone and then when he was down in the zone we would see more 88 90 mph i have actually noticed in games when he is into the sixth inning you are starting to see the 93 94s come out more often which is a sign of really grooving into his delivery i just really believe the overall program he has gone through over the years has really matured him a lot quicker than we probably thought he still has a ways to go as far as where he is going to get to but it is definitely a bright thing to see
4236408 he is kind of doing the same thing as rondon we have had to do some transition things in his delivery and he has done a good job with adapting and making the adjustments we have been trying to make with him through that process he went through some unsureness about making the adjustments he has been professional in his side work and we are starting to see a more consistent pitcher who is able to keep us in the game for six innings you are starting to see a more consistent slider more consistency to his changeup and a little bit better fastball command to both sides of the plate
4236409 we saw him on a tract where he had five pretty good outings in a row and we felt like he had kind of grasped some things with what he was going through we are trying to control his effort and emotions a little bit and trying to get him to know himself a little more as far as when he is in the heat of battle what are the adjustments you need to make like i said he had had five stints where he was giving us two innings kept his pitch count to 30 and was not having those 25 pitch innings and walking three guys and getting cornered into throwing fastballs last night was an exception as myrtle beach swings the bats pretty good i felt like he kind of lost his composure somewhat and started overthrowing and then tried to back off and just could not duplicate his release point and ultimately ended up walking four guys the good sign is he was back on the mound today and he wanted to get back to that feeling he had a couple outings ago we are just trying to get him back on track with some of the things he has told us he is going through we have kind of given him some things to work on daily in a throwing program and some flat groundwork on the mound he is just trying to duplicate his release point working downhill and understanding what the adjustments can be in the middle of a game
4236410 when vinnie first came up i believe he had two outings he was used to having and then all of a sudden i believe it was the third or fourth outing where he was not himself he walked two or three guys and was battling through the inning having not seen him a lot i really didnt know what to look for and he just kind of came up to me and asked me if i am seeing anything i said what are you struggling with just to try and let him talk through what he was going through and he told me his misses and i told him this is what i am seeing he tends to kind of fall off to the third base side so we did a little side day and worked on finishing his pitches more out front and just being more balanced and landing through the glove on that side day he had a very good day and was hitting it opposite arm side and he really felt some positive things then after a couple outings i went through some video and i just solidified what we had seen and i showed him some pitches where he was falling off and pitches where he was finishing i think it kind of gave him a grasp of what he needs to maintain in his delivery
4236411 he had a few outings when he first got here where he struggled we kind of did an evaluation thing with minor league pitching coordinator dave miller and talked about some things we wanted to attack definitely his breaking ball needed to be tighter and we are trying to make it more of a slider more of a power breaking ball also his fastball command needed to be more down in the zone of late his fastball command has been more down in the zone although not pinpointed to either side but it has been more down in the zone we had tightened up his breaking ball but it has gotten looser recently for whatever reason i am not sure so today it was kind of a maintenance thing to get back to what we talked about three weeks to a month ago and we just solidified the grip solidified his hand position at release and just tried to get the rotation back to being more of a slider
4236412 this is the first year i have had matt and watched him pitch at any length at first i had seen the things that were in his player plan and journal entries about the game speeding up on him and he just kind of gets to being a thrower and not a pitcher we have kind of done some things with mental preparation in his pre pitch routine after a result he is not happy with just trying to slow his heart rate down and get back into the moment of making one pitch at a time ill give you an example of what will happen hell throw a pitch to his arm side and miss hell throw another pitch to his arm side and miss and then he will walk off the mound toward the catcher and take a nice ten second walk around to the back of the mound take in two or three deep breaths relax visualize the pitch walk up on the mound and then he will execute before what he would have done is he would have thrown the two balls and got right back up on the rubber and thrown it again we are just trying to give him some pre pitch routines that will allow him to slow the game down just a little bit where he can be more in control of his emotions he has done a much better job of attacking the zone he is not pinpointing or real dominating to either side but he is more in the strike zone we have tightened up his slider a little bit where he is throwing more of a power slider that is in the 81 84 range he has been at 91 92 mph with his fastball velocity so that seems to be improving he is finishing pitches more out front and staying in the glove better instead of trying to spin out toward the third base side he definitely has made some improvements this year i really see a confident pitcher now where when he comes off the mound he feels he is in control where earlier in the season it would almost be like making pitches wishing for outs now i see a different guy when he is out there
4236413 the first couple of outings went really well then i got into a little bit of a rough patch but lately i have been doing a lot better
4236414 for me it is not going to be much about strikeouts and overpowering people it is going to be about guys putting balls in play in lake county i think i may have had one game where i was hit around a little bit up here i have given up runs in situations that i have allowed myself to give up runs i have put myself in situation to give up runs as i have walked a few guys up here and hit a couple guys base hits are usually coming on a 2 1 or 2 0 fastball count i have been fortunate not to be hit around and i have been pitching well as of late trying to keep the ball down and pounding the zone consistently
4236415 it was mostly me coming out here being fired up and wanting to prove that i kind of belong up here and want to make an impact
4236416 just going out there and getting ahead of myself and getting out of my comfort zone and trying to be someone i am not going out there and throwing as hard as i can or put balls by guys which i am not going to do i am going to have success by getting groundballs and keeping people off balance i think coming out here i was really amped up and in doing that i screwed my mechanics up me and hibby have been working on that a lot lately watching video and getting that figured out it was more me than the hitters
4236417 i was in lake county and helped get them into the playoffs
4236418 so i want to slam the door shut when i get the ball and help put this team into the playoffs
4236419 obviously i would like to have done a little bit better up to this point but i think it is just part of it id like to be a little more consistent and put more good games together in a row than i have so far i dont feel like i have changed a lot it is just kind of one of those things it is going alright and our team is having some success so that helps out a lot
4236420 just a lot of little things here and there day to day but not anything real big whether it is working on getting a better load not cutting myself off on my front foot using my legs or backside a little more
4236421 reading sometimes helps me get my mind in the right frame and not too amped up
4236422 i like james patterson and john grisham but for non fiction i like a lot of military history right now i am reading a lot of stuff on navy seals special ops and the iraq war and afghanistan things like that which are pretty interesting
4236423 of course i am a cleveland fan so obviously i take a little bit better care of them than the rest even though i take good care of all the teams
4236424 it is fun to see these guys come through and then a few years down the road when i am sitting there watching tv with my grandkids or something and i say i know him and that guy liked peanut butter and jelly it is good to see them grow and become a professional ballplayer in the bigs
4236425 it does get a little warm here in myrtle beach
4236426 a few years ago i started putting out freeze pops and i am the only one in the league who puts them out the guys got into sort of a contest on who can eat the most of them the record is held by sean smith as he ate 51 of them about two years ago adam miller broke the record or so i thought and i found out that he didnt really break it because the last five that he ate he had them melted first and drank them and that doesnt count so he got stripped of his title laughs so smiths 51 is still the record and that is the record for the whole carolina league
4236427 it is a fun job to do but when it becomes just a job ill go back to being a ticket taker and work four hours
4236428 it is anywhere from a 10 12 hour day for 70 home games a year i get here two hours before the bus gets here and leave two hours after the game is over it is a lot of fun and is not a job because i love baseball
4236429 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4236430 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4236431 there are more than 35 000 visits each year in the u s to emergency departments for injuries from nail guns
4236432 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to an injury
4236433 carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4236434 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be
4236435 the voluntary standard change only called for shipment of the sequential triggers rather than their use
4236436 sequential triggers are now shipped with nail guns but the contact trip trigger is still being shipped in the same box
4236437 this was in an area with heavy media coverage and communication of the safety hazards
4236438 additionally the differences in speed were affected more by the skill of the carpenter than the trigger being used
4236439 working towards the required use of the sequential trigger will be important in the prevention of injuries among carpenters
4236440 consumers can go to their local home improvement store and purchase the same tool carpenters are using but they may not have any training
4236441 consumers who are less likely to receive training in tool use need to be sure they ask for a tool with a sequential trigger and they should ask for instructions in safe use as well

4236454 for blacks in the americas slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to them unfortunately its the worst thing that ever happened to white americans
4236455 make sense once you understand that jews are the ones who are always speaking in code when they use words like racists bigots anti semites they simply mean white people

4236503 lord i find that my life is very lonely since i gave you back the woman i remember how she used to sing and dance for me and look at me out of the corner of my eye and play with me and cling to me and her laughter was music and she was beautiful to look at and soft to touch so give her back to me again

4236513 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4236514 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4236515 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4236516 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4236517 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4236518 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough

4236530 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4236531 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4236532 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4236533 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4236534 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4236536 what aspect of obamas plan tax plan we are supposed to have concealed
4236537 we repeatedly make clear that obama would cut taxes for the poor and the middle class
4236538 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4236539 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4236540 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4236541 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us

4236543 do you know that tux loves you and has a wonderful plan for your computer
4236544 whats interesting is that top foreign policy advisers to obama are arguing that obama is much closer to george bush than john mccain is
4236545 and as you know this is a campaign that is trying to tie john mccain and george bush
4236546 senator obamas program at the moment sounds a lot more like another four years of george bushs present policies
4236547 the vladmir putin backed conflict with georgia was a three fer for john mccain it reminded voters how dangerous the world is allowed the republican nominee to distance himself from the more accomodationist bush administration and let him reinforce his maverick image
4236548 the obama campaign has provided information showing that sen obama did not attend trinity that day i regret the error
4236549 said with his natty tweeds and mournful demeanor from a mid century english novel is just about over his theories now left to a few thuggish intellectuals at columbia university and their graduates students by now also aging professors at the state university of whatever professors whose acolytes can no longer get jobs
4236550 the president has become what we have instead of genuine politics instead of genuine democracy
4236551 america doesnt need a bigger army it needs a smaller that is more modest foreign policy one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities modesty implies giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions when it comes to supporting the troops here lies the essence of a citizens obligation
4236552 i shall have such revenges on you both that all the world shall i will do such things what they are yet i know not but they shall be the terrors of the earth
4236553 one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first and one candidate who has not

4236555 we dont want to damage him mentally by bringing him up too soon if that happens they will probably never be ready the desire to stay out of last place is not a good enough reason to take a chance amp forego doing it the right way

4236557 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team im inspired by other great athletes on the tennis team and in every team from swimming track and field everyone thats inspired me got me through this win
4236558 it was what it was it hasnt sunk in yet
4236559 this doesnt by any means mean im better than him because i beat him one out of 10 times or whatever
4236560 but i was finally able to come up big on those important points i think this being considered a bad year for roger is just proof that hes been the best in the world for so long that we expect great things from him every single time he steps on the court

4236565 no son buenas cifras pero ser a inexacto hablar de recesi n
4236566 n o one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
4236567 we took the same questions the same surveys the same information and updated it to our most recent presidential elections
4236568 the american voter processes information about politics and candidates but they think about that essentially the same way they did 50 years ago
4236569 american voters are busy people and its a question of how they allocate their time
4236570 most voters most of the time dont pay any attention to politics they dont know a lot about politics they dont follow politics they maybe if they are lucky keep one or two issues at most on their minds
4236571 they dont connect the issues together and they dont associate the issues with a candidate
4236572 if the economy is going bad the party in the white house whether it is republican or democrat that party is going to lose a lot of votes
4236573 theres no single issue that more reliably hurts the party in the white house or helps the party in the white house
4236574 if the economy is going bad the party in the white house whether it is republican or democrat that party is going to lose a lot of votes
4236575 i just really need to decipher it and figure out what who i want to vote for and im not there yet
4236576 he looks like me thats all i can say he looks like me
4236577 a lot of people talked about how they voted for george bush because he was the kind of guy wed wanna have a beer with well that worked out real well
4236578 we think theyre wise users of their time they know the basics they know whats important to them and they go about their jobs putting food on the table and taking the kids to the dentist
4236579 they dont know the policy details but they dont need to know the policy details they know the policy outcomes they know what theyre living through
4236580 they know if their son is in combat they know if their neighbour is unemployed they experience the results of the policy and they decide whether on the basis of their experience whether the person in charge is doing a good job
4236581 the more you participate in politics the more you get out of the system
4236582 the people who participate more in the system are the haves the people who have more wealth more education
4236583 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position

4236585 writing is an intellectual activity not a bundle of skills
4236586 as if it could have been written in no other way

4236637 we think the recovery will be shaped more like a nike swoosh with gradual improvement in 2009 and then steady progress into 2010 as our economic fundamentals regain solid footing
4236638 with costs rising energy shrinking and environmental concerns rising we have to respond quickly
4236639 we have to radically revamp our line ups create cleaner technology and work with others to develop new energy new fuelling stations and smarter roads

4236655 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4236656 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia

4236757 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4236758 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4236759 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4236760 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4236761 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4236769 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
4236770 if the eggs get so large that the diameter of the oviduct and or cloaca becomes limiting an elongate shape can contain a larger volume than a sphere with the same diameter
4236771 birds clearly possess the ability to evolve spherical eggs why havent all of them done so except those that nest on cliffs and thus erased the evidence for your claim
4236772 this is exactly why i would expect all birds except the cliff nesting ones to have evolved spherical eggs asap yet very few have something is wrong
4236773 a textbook example of k selection due to a scarcity of predators if you dont know what k selection means you should learn it a few pages of google results should suffice
4236774 theres no good evidence for marsupials in the strict sense before the paleocene and obviously marsupials from almost last week wont tell us much about the first marsupials
4236775 metatherians marsupials and everything closer to them than to us reach back to the early middle cretaceous some 125 ma ago google for sinodelphys and estimate whether a family of sinodelphys would fit into an average oviraptorid egg i guess it would
4236776 theropods have a very stiff back and most of the tail is also very stiff
4236777 they still havent died out and most of them do not nest on islands most nest on in riverbanks by your logic they are all dead
4236778 turtles bury their clutches crocodiles guard and defend their nests maybe defending the nest is the ancestral archosaurian condition
4236779 said fangs are connected to the poison gland not to the mouth its impossible to drink through them
4236780 ok lets restrict us to those that were small enough and lets have a look at their feet adaptations for perching only within birds and probably in scansoriopteryx epidendrosaurus contrary to earlier reports even archaeopteryx did not have a backwards pointing first toe
4236781 oh and not that it matters but the hoatzin is one of the few leaf eating folivorous birds in existence has a few weird adaptations to that rather unique lifestyle
4236782 turtles bury their clutches crocodiles guard and defend their nests maybe defending the nest is the ancestral archosaurian condition
4236783 ok lets restrict us to those that were small enough and lets have a look at their feet adaptations for perching only within birds and probably in scansoriopteryx epidendrosaurus contrary to earlier reports even archaeopteryx did not have a backwards pointing first toe
4236784 if you need to rotate your eggs on a cliff you are exposing them to unnecessary danger obligatory rotation is thus not recommended for a cliff nester it follows that obligatory rotation evolved first and cliff nesting evolved later perhaps much later
4236785 although repenomamus probably could not run fast it could stand on its hindlimbs and walk effectively enough to stalk small prey as this new fossil of r robustus indicates
4236786 as much time 65 ma lies between repenomamus and the cretaceous paleogene boundary as between the boundary and now
4236787 if ovoid eggs are so costly why does any bird except the cliff nesting ones have them
4236788 i only say that eggs must be able to rotate before cliff nesting can evolve when crocodile eggs are rotated the embryo dies
4236789 how can the process get started when rotation kills the embryo first the ability to survive rotation must evolve then cliff nesting becomes possible the other way around its impossible
4236790 you cant eat the eggs of a mosasaur or plesiosaur any more than those of a stagodontid or
4236791 i still dont see that spherical eggs are more efficient
4236792 as mentioned before non spherical eggs allow an animal to produce a larger egg and hence larger hatchling this is important for birds as they dont fly until nearly fully grown
4236793 though not something as specialized for digging as an armadillo or mole
4236794 the effects of viviparity lactation and other forms of postnatal parental feeding upon the anatomy and energy budget of the parent and growth and development of the young are compared lactation makes the young nutritionally dependent upon the mother but mechanically independent of her at least for part of the time he advantages of these circumstances to the parent and the young are explained compared to viviparous reptiles and lower vertebrates mammalian fetuses are relatively small at birth but through lactation the mother continues to supply most or all of the juveniles food until they reach a large fraction of the adult size i propose the hypothesis that it is lactation not viviparity which is the unique feature of mammalian reproduction that has made possible the evolution of diphyodonty dentition composed of a limited number of accurately occlusible teeth rapid growth to maturity and mutualistic social behavior i argue that even in large species lactation and other forms of parental processing of the juveniles food enable them to be weaned directly onto the adult diet whereas reptiles of similar size require different diets at different growth stages i suggest that the decline of large reptiles at the end of the mesozoic may have been due to the climatic and floristic changes at that time making it difficult for their relatively small young to find suitable food unaided species which practiced suckling or parental processing of food for the juveniles would be favored because the larger most robust and adaptable parents subsidized the diet of the juveniles through their vulnerable early growth stages
4236795 though not something as specialized for digging as an armadillo or mole
4236796 i suggest that the decline of large reptiles at the end of the mesozoic may have been due to the climatic and floristic changes at that time making it difficult for their relatively small young to find suitable food unaided
4236797 i dont see where the difference between these two is
4236798 gravity is a force not a property of a body
4236799 but surely you havent missed the fact that nuclear fusion generates heat
4236800 these circumstances are very rare within those groups importantly i cant see a shrew or even badger sized mammal migrating there were no marine mammals in the mesozoic besides what do angiosperms and the k pg boundary have to do with each other
4236801 there are some today and probably there were more in the south american paleogene but frugivorous mammals from the mesozoic why marsupials are unknown
4236802 lots of people believe that the human menstrual cycle is somehow coupled to the moon
4236803 they overlook two very important things firstly the 29 day duration of the menstrual cycle is an average of a range of several days and secondly the human menstrual cycle is just that human
4236804 rats have a cycle of 11 days chimpanzees have one that is a bit longer than the human one why should of all mammals we be coupled to the moon
4236805 i think you have likewise merely found a coincidence in keeping with this not even all mammals have the same number of vertebrae and therefore spinal nerve pairs
4236806 i forgot 31 pleasing tones can it get more subjective than that
4236807 most atomic nuclei are not spheres they occupy a wide range from cigar shaped to disk shaped the sphere is a special case
4236808 most atomic nuclei are not spheres they occupy a wide range from cigar shaped to disk shaped
4236809 it was in a scientific american special volume that i read long ago
4236810 dd fight against a small leopard perhaps no chance against a lion dead meat thats why savanna chimps stay near trees and why our ancestors avoided that whole scene until they came upstream on boats
4236811 nuclei tend to be sphere like not oblong or ovoid
4236812 nuclei tend to be sphere like not oblong or ovoid
4236813 raymond any idea why not chimps can have a long life cycle and bear few young which develop slowly so obviously no predator can specialize on chimp eating without destroying the chimp population beyond that and the agility of chimps scampering up trees i cant see why they would not be an easy meal for savanna predators
4236814 during a high school biology class we tested the phenomenon by shining a spotlight into the eyes of a fairly large group of volunteers one at a time almost everyone sneezed at least once when the bright light was shone into their eyes briefly and the most susceptible people sneezed repeatedly until the light was no longer directed at their faces
4236815 they are very happy i have played with them for the delhi team they are very helpful its great fun to be with them in the indian team
4236816 he is a different bowler he is a very good bowler i have seen videos of his bowling i have been asking my teammates as well who have played him

4236819 poignant stories covering a wide range of social issues including post traumatic stress and women in the military coping with bullying and the basic elements of happiness
4236820 we were having a hard discussion about whether we could continue together under one roof when the conversation turned to the kids he said if you take the kids i will kill you he and i have discussed this horrible incident and he says it was just his australian manner and some humour however the mood and tone was all serious and i was devastated
4236821 throughout 2006 and 2007 i observed and objected to him offering our children beer from beer bottles and ice from scotch glasses
4236822 throughout the marriage i have protested his objections to things like the kids brushing their teeth going to the pediatrician for check ups having innoculations using sun block keeping a schedule and car seats fitting securely

4236833 we sincerely apologize for the error that resulted in fenway park being unavailable to host the 2009 acc baseball championship
4236834 the atlantic coast conference and its baseball championship are very important to us and we are truly sorry for this situation
4236835 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
4236836 in terms of this years event we are moving swiftly to find a quality venue to host one of our premiere conference championships
4236837 we look forward to bringing acc baseball to fenway and will do everything possible to make 2010 a great success
4236838 twenty years after being eclipsed by what was called the american hyper power we are witnessing the russian bears big comeback to the international scene the western diplomatic ballet now trying to temper the violence of the russian reaction to georgian president saakachvilis forceful blow against southern ossetia last thursday will change nothing naively saakachvili believed that having international law on his side was enough to enable him to use force the problem is that his western friends have just precisely violated these very rules by unilaterally recognizing kosovos independence in brussels earlier this year russian foreign minister lavrov solemnly warned his american counterpart condi rice the recognition of kosovo would set a precedent for abkhazia and south ossetia the americans and their major european allies were mistaken not take him seriously
4236839 were trying to find a way to remain as legal as we can and protect homeowners and luke air force base
4236840 and it looks like the best way to decide is to have litigation and have the judge tell us
4236841 were not dealing with a runway of a military operation were dealing with the area where they fly over
4236842 and the state also wants to defend veterans legally what we are doing is right and not taking away anyones rights we want it to be a win win deal when its over
4236843 surprise and glendale have been working as lead jurisdictions in determining the most appropriate way to stop the granting of building permits against state law
4236844 we have a history of the city standing shoulder to shoulder with luke and protecting it against encroachment
4236845 we quite recently have let our opinion be known to maricopa county regarding encroachment and we continue to support the mission of luke
4236846 if builders are allowed to encroach on the base luke will close
4236847 i would guess that within a decade it will close and how much money are we in the west valley going to lose if that happens how many empty houses will we have this could destroy economic development in the west valley
4236848 i feel sorry for those who have had the permit issued because they are definitely in a place of great possible damage or harm to themselves due to the location of where they would be placing their homes
4236849 really its in the states best interest and welfare of the people who own the property that kind of building cease
4236850 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4236851 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4236852 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4236853 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4236854 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
4236855 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
4236856 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear

4236859 grow your wealth with a comprehensive range of investment services
4236860 this confirms what many managers in the workforce are already keenly aware of there is an acute and growing need for more it professionals
4236861 with more and more businesses moving critical operational functions over to the network the it department is assuming a much more strategic role in the organization and needs its infrastructure to be designed implemented and maintained by highly skilled highly trained individuals
4236862 t here is a skill gap the difference between the supply of skilled workers and the demand for those skills represents a challenge for networking vendors and their clients and an opportunity for it professionals
4236863 the overall gap between supply and demand for networking professionals is about 8 percent of the total demand the good news is that the overall gap isnt getting any bigger the bad news is that in some specialties such as wireless networking the gap is large and in other segments such as network security the gap is growing very fast
4236864 its got all the bug fixes and performance enhancements that youd expect in a service pack but there are just so many new features in the net framework that were bringing to visual studio that we think sp1 is going to drive significant net adoption
4236865 this is a laundry list of things that didnt make it into this release for which theyve had a lot of customer demand since they released the ide
4236866 its exciting to see microsoft not only provide a roll up of performance and bug fixes but also deliver critical additional features that immediately address key customer scenarios
4236867 im happy to see that microsoft is delivering these kinds of features out of band so that we dont have to wait on the next major release i hope microsoft continues this pattern with future service pack releases
4236868 for developers the improvements to the wpf design time experience within visual studio have been greatly anticipated and welcomed
4236869 id recommend updating net framework 3 5 to sp1 just for that reason alone
4236870 most of the developers who have moved to wpf have been very happy with the core developer productivity
4236871 i agree that a lot of the marketing around wpf and a lot of the demos that you see look like eye candy but when the developers start working with whats essentially a declarative programming style around xml they realize that its a fundamentally better way to develop uis and i do believe that its the next generation approach to uis
4236872 id be the last person to recommend moving away from winforms just for the hell of it
4236873 but there are places where richer consumer experiences really matter and thats where wpf comes in
4236874 but user expectations for a rich experience appear to be rising
4236875 a lot of exciting stuff for the asp net space
4236876 the ado net entity framework allows you to have a higher level of abstraction over your data
4236877 so developers can deal with these high level concepts and do more model based programming starting with the database
4236878 it replicates what people like to do with hibernate linq to entities is as close as youre going to get to microsofts orm facility any time soon
4236879 to some extent microsoft is putting in place some real structural underpinnings that will let them do some nice things in the future around model view controller mvc architectures
4236880 when you look at the growing popularity of things like ruby on rails and spring you notice that one of the reasons developers like them so much is that theyre well established mvc architectures that you can program at a metadata level
4236881 and that lets you program against it in a whole new way
4236882 a combination of patterns and libraries that allows data stores to be exposed as a flexible data service
4236883 often in the most interesting application scenarios today youve got your data running on a server somewhere and you need some kind of web service to get at that data from a client machine
4236884 the new ado net data services allows richer and easier access to those services and in a more restful kind of way we can give you direct access to those web services and the platform takes care of the grungy stuff underneath
4236885 weve definitely been working on some of the normal service pack kinds of things in terms of making performance improvements and responding to customer feedback
4236886 but sp1 is about increasing developer productivity and lowering the barrier to good ideas with the net framework
4236887 in some ways were victims of our own success with the net framework
4236888 since the first release in 2001 weve added more features and more value and i think its come a long way but its gotten a little heavy as well
4236889 we think it gives us 80 percent to 90 percent of the features that client developers would want but in a much smaller package
4236890 were starting to see a lot more net projects that wed classify as enterprise scale
4236891 a lot of the features im seeing in sp1 are likely to make it easier for people to deploy net in bigger ways in broader senses in the enterprise
4236892 i guess thats a nice problem to have if youre microsoft
4236893 but this richness of choices is something that can create confusion among developers microsoft needs to continue to support developers to help them make the right choices among all the options they now have
4236894 this years data show a slight decline in hiring projections across different industries
4236895 we believe companies are being conservative in their planning based on the current market conditions industries such as insurance public and non profit reported a lower than last years headcount increase projection
4236896 as it becomes more business oriented and is run like a business those individuals that have it skills plus business knowledge and experience or degrees will likely have the fast track into roles which often have executive level exposure
4236897 after all it organizations are looking at not only technical skills but more importantly business skills
4236898 we are having trouble recognizing the code you have entered reasons for failure may include
4236899 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4236900 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4236901 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are

4236938 america doesnt need a bigger army it needs a smaller that is more modest foreign policy one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities modesty implies giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions when it comes to supporting the troops here lies the essence of a citizens obligation

4236956 isolationism protectionism not only diminishes trade and commerce but is a war upon capital and labor
4236957 gentlemen deceive themselves it is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance it is in effect the british colonial system that we are invited to adopt and if their policy prevail it will lead substantially to the recolonization of these states under the commercial dominion of great britain
4236958 the eagle does not dart a keener gaze upon his intended prey than that with which the british manufacturer and merchant watches the foreign market and the course even of our elections as well as our legislation
4236959 were talking about buildings or sites of national heritage significance and we have a number in tasmania
4236960 but the concern is actually national that we only have such a small amount 200 000 in fact comparable to the amount that say local government in tasmania is contributing to heritage within their own municipality
4236961 every body who is in the field will be scrutinised for his act
4236962 the standard instruction to our security forces in the normal course is to use minimum force they are asked to use prudence and patience they are not trained to go around and shooting and killing but occasions do arise when their initial planning isnt adequate or at the last moment the situation goes out of hand
4236963 my son is not used to all these pointing to the media you got to understand but i told him that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown so he has to put up with it it is part of his achievement
4236964 he is a world champion and an olympic champion these two feats are not common i had told abhinav that i shall give you wholehearted support till you win a medal at the olympics now that he has won it i m retiring let the country take care of him
4236965 i m feeling a little numb right now a bit overwhelmed but i m happy that i could experiment liberally during my competition due to the training i had put in over the last four years
4236966 i would like this achievement to bring about the positive change in the management and mindset of indian sports and i would really like to give back not only to air rifle but to the whole indian sporting management so that we can make winning a habit
4236967 it was a sort of emptiness you climb the mountain and there is nothing at the top when you work so hard to achieve something and you get it at the end there is a feeling of emptiness but then life goes on
4236968 i was upset after the athens and then i had this back injury it took a lot of courage and determination for me to even reach olympics so it s a bigger achievement for me than just winning a gold medal the journey was more important than the destination
4236969 i had some troubles i don t know what happened at the end of the day it gun worked so i don t want to think about it

4236971 we have entered into a binding agreement with torrent to sell the three carbamazepine versions in relation with the completion of our transaction with taro
4236972 the proposed acquisition would remove the direct competition between sun and taro for these key products and deny consumers the benefits of lower generic drug prices
4236973 i think if the canadian public really knew the extent of harm that asbestos has caused i think there would be an outrage over what the federal government is doing
4236974 i cannot describe to you the public health epidemic that unfolded before us and is still happening
4236975 were probably the only industrialized country not tracking the extent of the disease and its impact on our society
4236976 certainly the government will not support anything that may be viewed as critical of asbestos when theyre the chief cheerleaders for the asbestos industry

4236988 we are therefore rather sure that is we are sure that welding work that is important for safety has been done properly
4236989 if secondary welds are made carelessly who is to say that the primary ones were not made the same way
4236990 the violations that have taken place can be a security risk already now another matter which is at least as important is that the safety culture that is in a shambles can form a serious risk when more critical phases in the construction begin

4237000 it makes perfect sense to play a game or two in toronto to generate greater support
4237001 in the end it helps keep the bills viable economically speaking in western new york
4237002 i think there is a league wide commitment to keep the team viable in buffalo and this is part of the strategy
4237003 it would be a karmic kick in the nuts for this place
4237004 remove a team like the bills from a city like this and it would be a devastating blow to an already struggling town
4237005 the glory days of buffalo when i was a kid back in the 1970s when the steel plants were raging
4237006 theyve made this big deal that the toronto deal is going to save the franchise
4237007 the bills franchise is solid every game is sold out
4237008 ralph and understandably so gets nervous when people start hovering over his stadium to figure out the next step
4237009 its got to be viable finances are important but i think the community has a huge stake in the bills and i plan on being a part of anybody who wants make sure that is a given
4237010 but i dont think its appropriate for us to keep predicting what the next steps are
4237011 this somewhat finalizes how we want to regionalize this franchise and put a stick in the ground above the border
4237012 we would be remiss if we did not try to capture over five million people within our home marketing territory and try to strengthen the franchise right here in western new york
4237013 it boils down to the same old story follow the money
4237014 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i would be convicted in advance
4237015 i made the cartoons to highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4237016 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammed as a hostage i have no problems with islam but with the terrorists
4237017 were still seeing continued weakening in the local and national economies
4237018 the city has been performing better than the nation in terms of employment and job creation and it continues to do that
4237019 but we also have to remember that these numbers are subject to large revisions which might bring about a sadder story
4237020 i just took this job at nguoi viet and the project im in charge of the nguoi viet yellow pages will be coming to a peak at the same time as the elections so i dont think i will have the time to commit to both the paper also thinks it would be a conflict of interest for me to run so im dropping out

4237032 his absence from the country was an indictment of the government of the day i would just hope he is coming back permanently he is an enormous resource
4237033 i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor the dispossessed and those in need
4237034 i want to see that i am praying that that has happened
4237035 we have three sedimentary basins but we only know with a certain amount of precision the reserves on the coast we have only incomplete data for the other two
4237036 there is already strong data to say we have oil but we still need more we need to know whats there
4237037 you must not look at things as they are you must see what they will become not long ago angola wasnt a big producer either
4237038 it is as if they are trying to foment a floor fight at the convention
4237039 until we know what senator clinton and senator barack obama have worked out
4237040 all he is doing is asking us to hold off on signing the petition
4237041 we all signed a document that said we we would vote for her on the first ballot
4237042 unless she gives me direction otherwise that is what i intend to do
4237043 those 18 million votes count for something it would be untraditional to not have clinton on the first ballot
4237044 people want to be able to vote for her then theyll vote for him in the second round
4237045 it is as if they are trying to foment a floor fight at the convention
4237046 which by the way is fine with me if we fight lets fight but lets be organized here we cant fight without a leader
4237047 war may be bad for children and other living things but there are times when peace is worse for children and other living things and this is one of those times saying no to war in iraq means saying yes to the continued oppression of the iraqi people
4237048 invading and rebuilding iraq will not only free the iraqi people it will also make the saudis aware of the consequences they face if they continue to oppress their own people while exporting terrorism and terrorists the war on iraq will make it clear to our friends and enemies in the middle east and elsewhere that we mean business free your people reform your societies liberalize and democratize or were going to come over there remove you from power free your people and reform your societies for ourselves

4237060 the wire has never received an emmy nomination for drama series a crime almost as heinous as the ones that were perpetrated each week on this gritty baltimore cop show
4237061 the wire the complete fifth season 60 a dvd that preserves all 10 episodes in the finale of this hbo classic
4237062 the wire deserves the nobel prize for literature even david simon co creator of the series bemoans the lack of awards during the commentary track that accompanies the final episode which incidentally did receive an emmy nomination for its writing
4237063 the wire the last word focuses specifically on the industry giving several real editors and reporters including klein jacob weisberg of slate and steve luxenberg of the washington post the chance to offer their opinions on the state of the media today its not a pretty picture
4237064 the wire odyssey is semi entertaining and the six commentary tracks are informative especially to marylanders who get a kick out of all the shout outs to the real baltimore personalities and places that pop up in the episodes
4237065 the wire is used to wanting more as satisfying as this last season was we still want more mcnulty more daniels and more multi faceted stories from that rough very real city and of course more emmy nominations

4237080 prima facie this would put an upward pressure on interest rates because it translates into higher borrowing
4237081 todays story was due to the move on the oil and there was some stop losses bunched up around the 42 80 per dollar mark once those gave away it fell sharply
4237082 most major operators are already aware of the advantages of automatics and many of the major transport operators have made the commitment to automatics for urban distribution work in particular

4237134 putting the minds and ideas of three separate industry leaders together on the same stage is going to be a very unique and enlightening experience for our attendees
4237135 these panelists not only have nearly 100 years of combined experience in the transportation industry but their dedicated involvement with these influential groups is sure to generate an informative educational and quite likely controversial discussion
4237136 we understand that these changes will be extremely difficult for many of our employees and their communities
4237137 while the additional investment and new positions at our macungie plant and the conversion of our allentown test center into a customer demonstration and reception center will mean a major continued mack presence in the lehigh valley we will do everything we can to facilitate this transition responsibly and sensitively for affected employees
4237138 taking these steps will make us a more efficient agile and cost effective organization in almost every aspect of our business from product development to production to aftermarket support

4237150 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement
4237151 we will make sure that members of the windows 7 development team represent themselves as such as well

4237245 they clearly demonstrate that theres been development on the flood plain after the moratorium in june 2001
4237246 the queensland governments assured us that basically theyve approved structures because they were built before that date
4237247 but our imagery quite clearly shows that we could only find three storages and essentially there are a whole lot of channels there that have been built post 2001 and this essentially breaches that agreement
4237248 this might be the first of more developments and the paroo is certainly unique and recent reports from the mdbc murray darling basin commission show that of the 23 valleys in the mdb the paroo is the only one in good condition
4237249 so i think we should always use the paroo as the yardstick on how rivers can be preserved and maintained in good condition

4237258 the triple digit demand growth trend for our bioplastics continued in the first half of this year
4237259 supported by both continually mounting environmental awareness and high fossil fuel prices we see tremendous interest in our products from the marketplace expectations for the second half continue in line with our own robust 2008 plan and industry analyst projections
4237260 cereplast made great progress during the second quarter towards our goal of becoming a mainstream bioplastics supplier
4237261 cereplasts sales growth is starting to accelerate and several key development grades of resin are in commercialization our seymour facility is nearing start up bringing step changes in our capacity and cost efficiency and our strengthened management sales and development teams are driving improvements in all aspects of our operations the outlook for our business is very strong
4237262 seracares future growth will be driven by the core segments of our business molecular diagnostics vaccine development and cellular assays and we continue to see double digit sales growth of key products in these areas during the last quarter we made significant investments in both research and development and sales and marketing to drive expansion in these segments
4237263 importantly in the fiscal third quarter seracare also achieved an important milestone for the company relisting on nasdaq which we believe directly supports our growth strategy by increasing opportunities for both greater visibility and enhanced liquidity
4237264 we began feeling the effects of the downturn in the economy earlier this year just as we were gearing up to implement an aggressive growth plan that would have added up to 20 new offices
4237265 as a result of the branch consolidation and strict cost controls we are now generating positive cash flow and expect to continue to do so for the remainder of this year focusing our attention on the 62 remaining stores has continued to increase their sales and has resulted in a steady overall increase in commands revenue numbers in recent weeks
4237266 both overall revenue and sales per store increased in the second quarter over the prior quarter up 6 5 and 16 respectively and we are seeing continued improvement so far in the third quarter these increases are significant in light of the net reduction of 16 stores in the first half of 2008
4237267 the net loss and the reduction in the gross margin for the quarter ended june 27 2008 were driven in large part by high workers compensation costs from claims incurred in 2006 we expect workers compensation costs to moderate over the remainder of the year and into 2008 as we develop additional claims history and as we benefit from our comprehensive safety program instituted in early 2007
4237268 third quarter results are supported by steady growth in revenue in both our aviation and atf businesses we had great success in the quarter lowering our operating expenses by 37 5 when compared to 3rd quarter last year managements continued focus is on generation of free cash flow not only to support the steady growth in our core business but also to enable us to proactively move forward on a key strategic goal to restructure overall debt
4237269 our overriding commitment is to strengthen the companys balance sheet
4237270 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4237271 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4237272 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4237273 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4237274 gary dale has been a valuable member of the companys management team serving in a number of increasingly important roles
4237275 he also is highly experienced in many of the disciplines that will be essential to future growth including the operations of our publishing labels global market expansion sales and distribution and business development we look forward to further contributions from gary in his new position as our coo
4237276 bart and tom bring a wealth of valuable senior leadership experience that will help guide the continued growth of our company

4237287 the investments the company made in the 2007 fourth quarter and 2008 first quarter have helped to drive margin expansion and increases in interclicks comscore ranking reflecting growing recognition from clients of the unique proposition we offer advertisers and publishers
4237288 in addition to growing revenue and improving margins the company has taken other steps to enhance operating results through the hiring of experienced sales executives to enter new geographic markets while simultaneously streamlining operations to reduce corporate overhead since the end of the first quarter interclick has also improved its balance sheet through the repayment of approximately 2 9 million of debt further increasing its flexibility to grow its business with industry leaders such as google forecasting that online ad revenue could reach 500 billion we believe that interclick is well positioned to participate in this growth

4237308 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4237309 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4237310 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4237311 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4237312 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4237313 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4237314 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him

4237321 i dont think the way to beat them is to rough them up youve just got to be physical and match them as much as you can up front
4237322 were not going to go out there throwing punches and carrying on like idiots
4237323 its a sign of how youve got to play melbourne
4237324 its going to be physical its on a smaller field they play through the middle of the park youve got to have some big tough guys there ready to go into battle
4237325 i suppose it is a bit of a sign of how the games going to be but i think everyones pretty sure how theyre going to turn up
4237326 teams come in trying to play that aggressive in your face type of football and we kind of enjoy it too fighting fire with fire standing up to be counted
4237327 you have to match up depending on what tactic teams bring you adapt to it
4237328 i dont think anyone knows where were at right now even ourselves
4237329 this is probably a good week to try and get things back on track but its not the be all and end all
4237330 weve done pretty well to be where we are on the table which is good because weve still got our best ahead whether that comes the next few weeks or not were not sure
4237331 check the locations of teams the crowd demographics the tv coverage the simplified nature of the game
4237332 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4237333 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4237334 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4237335 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4237336 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4237337 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4237338 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider the good and the life and the continuity of the club and you make decisions for long term rather than short term
4237339 we care that were really competitive right now and we want to win this week

4237343 to play for your home town team is a great feeling and to be given the honour of leading a club with such a long and successful history is something im extremely proud of
4237344 ill do everything to ensure this is a successful new era for the glory
4237345 this is a fresh team with a fresh outlook and were committed to achieving our goals of making the top four in the first instance and then onto bigger and better things from there

4237348 it was certainly an exciting time for me i was in my first year with the wallabies
4237349 it was phenomenal the guys were on a real high after the world cup win in 99 and theyd won the bledisloe earlier and then to win the tri nations was just a real bonus
4237350 i remember walking past the huddle and all the springboks players were huddled around nelson mandela and half of them were on their knee so you can just see theres a definite passion and respect for nelson as we all do have
4237351 there was a couple of interruptions a few things went wrong off the field and i think they were probably the most disappointing losses because wed had such a hard year and the team had tried so hard to sort of break that losing streak
4237352 youre under the spotlight a lot more over there and i do truly think that they try and set you up a bit over there
4237353 certainly your first time playing at loftus versfeld with the wallabies is difficult its not like playing for your super 14 side its a different atmosphere its a very hostile atmosphere and youve got to be mentally prepared for that
4237354 they bang on your bus as you arrive up there youve got yelling and screaming its just a different place a different sort of crowd to what wed ever see
4237355 but you can also use that to your own advantage and most of the guys will do that
4237356 it certainly was talked about with the team we realised that the majority of the guys hadnt had success there and it was always how are we going to do it
4237357 every year we went over there we tried to tweak things and every time we finished a game i always thought wed had our best preparation so i dont know why we couldnt win
4237358 i think its a difficult place to win in but i dont think its any more difficult than new zealand or anywhere else the way the games have gone
4237359 and i certainly dont think that the current wallaby team would have any problems or issues or dramas with whats happened in the past

4237363 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress
4237364 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
4237365 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
4237366 but we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs residential mortgage backed securities markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel

4237373 at the start of the week locky walked over and i turned to the boys and said who is this bloke
4237374 they said he was some young kid from roma who was apparently pretty sharp
4237375 i didnt know him and i remember looking at them and saying are you guys serious
4237376 he came on in the 50th minute and i think we were up 40 10 and he did three or four unbelievable things
4237377 i looked at steve renouf and said darren lockyer remember that name because its going to go a long way
4237378 id put him up their with joey and alfie as the best ive ever played with and ive played with some greats
4237379 as a player he is one of the greats but as a mate and what he brings to the game you couldnt ask for anything more
4237380 his comments the other day about owing rugby league so much and that he would never play rugby union typifies the person he is
4237381 great players keep evolving and pound for pound there arent any tougher players
4237382 the kiwis used to try and rough him up all the time before tests but he was that tough it never worked
4237383 just being injured this year hes shown what a marvellous competitor he is to get back and be part of the team
4237384 rugby league needs to hang onto him hes one of a kind
4237385 he is my mate and wayne bennett has been influential in my career
4237386 but at the of the day you want nothing more than to go to suncorp and cause an upset
4237387 if that happens ill be one of the first to walk into the dressing room to congratulate him lockyer on such a great feat so far
4237388 im sure hell be up for a big game back at suncorp for the first time
4237389 its a really big game for us with locky breaking the record
4237390 itll be a great atmosphere and thats the environment he loves
4237391 our back row will be a little smaller without tc carroll and eastwood but david stagg and corey parker will be there and were still going to have some big guys coming off the bench
4237392 well miss a little bit of his impact but well make up for that with staggy and corey going 80 minutes
4237393 hes been one of their form players and you take one of them out of any side and it detracts from your performance
4237394 were glad hes not playing but its not a major issue
4237395 its not going to win us or lose us a game

4237397 ive got no doubt greg inglis future is here and in rugby league
4237398 one thing about greg is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4237399 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4237400 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats here in rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too
4237401 we probably got caught up in looking too far ahead a few weeks ago when we played the warriors and they came out and gave it to us
4237402 ever since then its been the approach of preparing the best you can every week

4237417 the jets game means a lot to me especially after the way last season finished
4237418 that was very disappointing and definitely stupid and id like to just erase all memory of that really
4237419 its been mixed emotions watching the matches ive got my good friends playing at the olympics and im so happy for them to be there representing australia
4237420 but at the same time i know that i should be there with them and i would be if i didnt do what i did in the grand final
4237421 its tough to take but ive only got myself to blame for it all im looking forward to getting past it now
4237422 i train with him every day and weve become very good mates in the few weeks hes been here
4237423 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but just in life in general hes a very smart man and hes passed on a lot of advice to me in the short time hes been with us
4237424 there was a time there where i thought everything was against me
4237425 hes been through a lot himself and hes told me things will always get better and not to be too hard on myself

4237427 a testament to who we are as people its fast like the millennium falcon aggressive like a pack of hyenas and hopes to never be compared to this stupid fucking fake death and thrash movement going on it has guest appearances on vocals and guitar by steve austin on last name porter and here there be monsters and another vocal appearance by eugene robinson of oxbow on here there be monsters and their parts are haunting the album is ferocious we the guillotine sounds like a crash course in burning out to me expect an all out war on your ears for 40 minutes without brees breakdown after breakdown or yngwie wannabe guitar playing you can expect music from the heart
4237428 we just wanted to create our version of an early punk record like how it was when we were kids first getting into punk metal and hardcore no frills no gloss no bullshit we had no interest whatsoever in creating fake ass death metal breakdowns or tired arpeggio sweeps or whatever stupid ass bands think the in thing is these days
4237429 i dont know where they stand legally but they the nrl seem to be making a lot of noise because they cant do much more than that
4237430 the orders were served on the first defendant williams certainly that betters our position and what we are doing at the moment is observing whether he will breach that order by playing in a game scheduled for friday morning australian time
4237431 the first defendant and the second defendant nasser were notified of the listing today
4237432 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
4237433 i think weve got some time to go before we get to that though i think weve got to stick solid with the sanctity of the contract
4237434 our first big test is tonight against toulouse who were the champions last season its a big game
4237435 the thing is in the heat of the moment instinct takes over and thats what he is used to doing
4237436 bit by bit we have to forge his way out of that and change his habits
4237437 check the locations of teams the crowd demographics the tv coverage the simplified nature of the game
4237438 theyre always heated exchanges and bragging rights down the f3 are up for grabs so theyll be up for the game

4237465 a lot of people are severely reducing the size of their herds and that may cap the beef price but once they run out of animals to cull and sell off beef prices are going to shoot through the roof
4237466 a few years ago we saw about 900 000 people raising cattle
4237467 were looking then to buy things when theyre at their cheapest and store them for as long as we need to until we can utilize it
4237468 this is a way we can help our cost of production so we lower it
4237469 oh hummingbird poop i cant remember if i took my birth control
4237470 but assuming that those results hold and they are quite robust this also points to biologic pathways in the brain such as the insulin receptor signaling pathway that might be a focus for developing new treatment strategies for alzheimers disease in the future
4237471 studies of the brain have found either no relation or a reverse relation between diabetes and brain lesions
4237472 the combination therapy group had on average 80 fewer neuritic plaques than the other groups but those other 4 groups were not statistically different from each other
4237473 its really difficult to extrapolate 1 postmortem cdr score to the real cognitive condition of the person
4237474 it may be that thats the truth but i just really dont think thats the case
4237475 our hypothesis is that the gene and protein expression of those people on combination therapy is going to be normalized
4237476 very intriguing because the linkage between diabetes and ad is something thats been bandied about for some time now and weve been unable to make a connection thats really conclusive
4237477 this study is pretty interesting because the neuropathology is a pretty hard marker of a change and this association between the 2 drugs being administered together and such a significant reduction in plaque load i think is a very hard piece of data
4237478 if we could reduce the incidence of alzheimers disease in that population by combining these drugs i think that would be something certainly worth following up we need to look much more closely at diabetes as a risk factor for ad pathology and probably ad itself
4237479 i think this is something now in the field that is going to have to be aggressively investigated what manifestation in the brain is most predictive of the dementia or memory deficits
4237480 so its an interesting time in the field because plaques and tangles have been the hallmarks but its always been a question whether they are a marker of dementia or just some sort of indirect indication of memory deficit

4237497 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4237498 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4237508 this time they told me that the captain demanded that i delete the video
4237509 if the captain had nicely asked me to delete the video i dont think i would have disobeyed a pilot

4237546 after viewing the video they demanded that i delete it
4237547 i asked why the head stewardess went as far as to tell me that i had broken a law by using an electronic item during the flight
4237548 i do not even know how to download a video on the internet

4237550 if the captain had nicely asked me to delete the video i dont think i would have disobeyed a pilot
4237551 the police a jetblue rep and a tsa official all looked at the video and agreed that it was too dark to really see who was on it and that it clearly had been shot from my seat so i had not interfered with anything that was going on
4237552 he informed me that if i didnt immediately delete it i could never fly on jetblue again
4237553 he said that he would be filing a report that would be shared with other airlines and i might have a hard time getting any airline to let me fly
4237554 when i tried to explain anything i was told i could not talk only he could talk
4237555 even with a movie like satya im not sure that its commercial success has anything to do with what the huh you guys are so mean

4237562 a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance ii pet 3 9
4237563 deshalb soll moskau engere beziehungen zur europ ischen union eu herstellen und gemeinsam gegen die entfachung von konflikten auf dem kontinent k mpfen
4237564 wir sind uns dar ber im klaren dass das regime saakaschwili in georgiens genau so wie das ukrainische und einige andere regimes direkt von den amerikanern aufgep ppelt wurden das sind deren politische projekte
4237565 dabei gehe ich von der logik politischer gesetze aus die genauso wie physikalische gesetze immer funktionieren in dieser hinsicht ist die situation jetzt vor allem in der ukraine herangereift f r einen schlag gegen russland was pr sident viktor juschtschenko dabei zum anlass nutzt ist eher eine taktische frage die ich im moment nicht beantworten kann
4237566 wir russland und eu m ssen jetzt verstehen dass die sicherheit in europa in unserem gemeinsamen interesse liegt w hrend des kalten krieges hatte amerika geholfen das problem des kommunismus zu l sen aber jetzt artet amerika selbst zu einem problem aus sie amerikaner wollen den frieden auf unserem kontinent ruinieren
4237567 in unseren beziehungen zur eu der ukraine georgien und anderen l ndern immer auf der bank mitsitzen
4237568 seine j ngste rede strotzt vor unglaubw rdigen informationen enth lt aber mehrere wichtige fakten nicht
4237569 even though refinancing borrowers who take out a 1 year adjustable rate mortgage arm today would save about three quarters of a percentage point in rate relative to a 5 year arm or 15 year fixed rate mortgage frm the concerns about inflationary pressures leading to future interest rate increases may be causing borrowers to choose the safety and certainty of fixed rates
4237570 in the second quarter mortgage rates on all products crept up a bit with 15 year fixed mortgage rates averaging 5
4237571 teaser rates on arms have largely disappeared during the second quarter the initial interest rate on 1 year arms averaged three tenths of a percentage point higher than the fully indexed rate without an extra discount arms just arent attracting many borrowers in todays market
4237572 just the very fact that i have a myspace makes my students think well maybe we can talk to this guy and open the lines of communication
4237573 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not those teachers are ruining it for the ones legitimately trying to help children
4237574 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
4237575 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
4237576 most of us are educated far beyond our level of obedience
4237577 avrete notato che la cartella era denominata gimp 2 4 ma se la stessa cartella fosse stata scritta senza il punto ossia cos
4237578 although the implication of this finding for managerial policy is straightforward it should be treated with caution it is based on specific assumptions in a theoretical model it is also only one of several effective demographic factors to merge the cultures other options might be more attractive
4237579 these problems can linger on for years after the merger has been completed
4237580 failing to successfully integrate the cultures is a very serious thing
4237581 the problem is that people can make up any number of stories that can justify any type of merger
4237582 youll hear that a merger will be successful because two organizations are very similar in their cultural content another merger will be hailed as a good one because the organizations cultures are so different and will therefore complement each other
4237583 the demographic way of thinking about mergers and acquisitions could be very useful to firms considering such a step
4237584 i will follow you lord but let me first say farewell to those at my home
4237585 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
4237586 whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none and whoever has food is to do likewise
4237587 do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation and be content with your wages
4237588 good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
4237589 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
4237590 we believe that every child really does matter and we need to do all we can to ensure that children with disabilities have the same opportunity to succeed
4237591 scopul sistemului educational ar trebui sa fie acela de a crea tineri capabili si bine dezvoltati emotional optimisti si motivati in esenta sa politica de educatie trebuie sa admita ca cea mai buna cale de a permite oamenilor sa isi valorifice potentialul este sa ii pretuiasca mai degraba pentru cine sunt decat dupa niste performante raportate la tinte fixe toate scolile ar trebui sa adopte o strategie pentru a promova bunastarea emotionala sociala si psihologica curicula trebuie largita pentru a include mai multe oportunitati legate de sport arte creativitate si alte activitati similare intr un stadiu timpuriu al vietii lor tinerilor ar trebui sa li se ofere informatii legate de tipurile de satisfactie derivate din diferite feluri de alegeri de viata poate chiar prin studiul mai detaliat al conceptului de buna stare un sistem educational ce promoveaza prosperitatea va conduce la o productivitate crescuta o societate mai antreprenoriala si cetateni mai activi
4237592 common wisdom holds that kids involved with gangs are long gone from school unseen and vanished into street life
4237593 they keep pressuring me because i know people from both sides
4237594 we start walking and talking and i dont go back to class
4237595 in the wake of a bloody 2008 that has so far claimed the lives of six teenagers from the seattle area in gang related shootings parents school district officials police outreach workers and churches have become increasingly frantic to find solutions but while each of these groups offers ideas none has yet been able to coordinate with the others to develop a sustained plan of attack blame however abounds parents and preachers point at the school district educators insist they are doing what they can everyone it seems complains about money
4237596 the new anti gang group youth 180 funded by the city has already enlisted about 10 teens to hit the streets and reach out to others so far its working but theirs is merely one small effort and lack of continuity typically plagues such campaigns highlighted in one years budget cycle only to be excised in the next
4237597 in 2004 however money to fund team for youth was folded into the families and education levy with a new mandate caseworkers now would focus solely on improving graduation rates wasl scores and other measurable outcomes
4237598 the gang problems flare up money comes pouring in they go away the money dries up
4237599 this problem is never going to go away until there is something sustainable for working with youth in prevention and intervention
4237600 working directly with families works thats what we learned more than anything in the early years a lot of those old school programs we need to bring back
4237601 the presence of a youth gang problem must be recognized before anything meaningful can be done to address it
4237602 for those unfortunate youths in my own city who think they have no other alternative but to join gangs and continue to kill one another suffice it to say when they value their own life i will value their life until then i dont care
4237603 what is my life going to be about if i know the difference between good and bad and i choose bad because its easier is it now on me to admit that
4237604 james mother who insisted that his full name not be published for fear of retaliation made plans to enroll her son at another school this fall
4237605 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
4237606 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4237607 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities
4237608 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
4237609 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
4237610 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
4237611 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
4237612 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
4237613 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
4237614 who knows what will happen in a year from now
4237615 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4237616 ali obviously had no idea about director peter davys past
4237617 if she did know she never would have auditioned for him
4237618 runway to change with special guests sarah jessica parker amp ann wintour
4237619 it was either a typo or the extra syllable would have thrown off the haiku we were going for
4237620 de ce nu s ar mai citi carti peste douzeci de ani
4237621 im so excited about my new solo deal with warner its been a long time coming it s important for me to give my fans the diamond they already know but to also give them something new from me i hope to work with a few of my favorite people in the industry from timbaland to t pain on my new album so theres definitely going to be a few surprises in store
4237622 one things for sure my dear children do not worry about cleaning mopping laundry dishes etc but they will say mom you didnt sit with me and talk or mom you dont play with me
4237623 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with husband tony parker

4237625 gaby is having a very tough time being the mother of two overweight hyperactive children
4237626 i see him all the time at least once a week
4237627 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4237628 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
4237629 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years

4237633 growing productivity must be the foundation of everything we do
4237634 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4237635 setting the party line who gets to decide what positions constitute conservatism
4237636 if you cant do the big attacks do the small attacks do smaller attacks and more of them
4237637 i propose you start with those that have blood on their hands torturing and suppressing muslims like high ranking intelligence officers the governor or any foreign official
4237638 you know it used to be that the face of al qaeda was bin laden and the core that is still the case but now we are reminded about al qaeda on a regular basis more because of the activities of the local cells
4237639 what this does more than anything else is provides people who are inclined to carry out such attacks with the sense that they now have some information and pushes them to actually go through with it
4237640 we have vulnerabilities absolutely in an open society youre going to have vulnerabilities
4237641 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4237642 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4237643 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4237644 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4237645 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4237646 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4237647 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing
4237648 municipal law is stronger in certain areas than international law
4237649 so even though it is true that we ought to respect the ruling of the world court our constitution says that any treaty that is relating to seceding or taking over or annexing any part of the country must be ratified by the national assembly and that is what we are asking the government to do
4237650 yaradua is in a very tight spot if i were in his position i will do the same
4237651 either we are playing by the rules of the game or not we went to the international court of justice and there is a verdict against us and we are stuck with it so what do you expect us to do to renege on what we are party to no we cant do that
4237652 the case of the bakassi peninsula has proven the viability of a peaceful and legal settlement of border disputes when it is done with the full support of the international community and in a spirit of mutual respect good neighbourliness and cooperation
4237653 a triumph for the rule of law which lies at the very core of the mission and work of the united nations
4237654 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4237655 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4237656 we believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue and we are always ready for dialogue
4237657 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4237658 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4237659 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4237660 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time
4237661 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4237662 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4237663 two detainees suffered minor abrasions as a result of the alleged assaults eight others were confined overnight in a detainee housing unit which was sprayed with riot control agent and then the ventilation secured
4237664 so these super powerful elites and oil companies have kept this technology secret for years but now are powerless to stop a dude with a youtube account
4237665 i support conservation efforts just not all that global warming crap
4237666 president musharraf is being forced out by a ruling coalition government which includes parties such as the pakistan peoples party of late prime minister benazir bhutto and the pakistan muslim league nawaz of former prime minister nawaz sharif these parties have been sworn enemies in pakistan and have come together only for the cause of opposing musharraf
4237667 what would hold such parties together once president musharraf is gone would they parties then squabble amongst themselves
4237668 if the military remains neutral then there is a chance that political parties will learn to become more mature over a period of time and we wont have petty infighting of the kind which has broken parties and political alliances in the past
4237669 why go with the flow when something is not working
4237670 any homicide investigation any major investigation you rely on information you receive from either a persons of interest persons whove been charged or members of the public and were following up on the leads
4237671 what happened we had two ladies in police custody and they were charged today in connection relating to the mullany investigation and they have been remanded in custody
4237672 for strategic reasons we would not want to go into detail of the charges
4237673 we expect to do some further arrests further down the road they were charged with some offences but were not charged with murder that is as much as i will want to say
4237674 a significant development as far as the investigation is concerned
4237675 the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
4237676 rooms have web cams to let nurses monitor patients and beds that turn 360 degrees perform respiratory percussion and vibration turn and weigh patients and elevate them to a chair position
4237677 for example it costs you 100 000 to produce something and a customer is willing to pay you 1 million
4237678 we would agree that 900 000 is a great profit margin but what if you have to pay the 100 000 in december and your customer isnt going to pay you until april
4237679 they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans

4237688 dear noboru i honestly dont know where to start or even how to begin i could sit and go through years of my life to try and find an analogy to relate to this situation but i found nothing theres a first time for everything and i can say without a doubt this is the first time ive felt actually felt ive dated people yeah but the longest ive ever dated anyone was for not even four months the rest i just brushed off because i was bored and it was all the same solely for comfort for reassurance a backup plan the one thing that stuck though was knowing that i deserved better i deserved the best it was hidden in the back of my mind of course until i found you and when i did find you i sat aside everything i sat aside my boyfriend at the time because i was more interested in you if i thought even for a split second that you werent perfect in my eyes or absolutely amazing i would not be writing this so i discreetly kept it up over the months loving you when you faced hardships i stood by your side and held your chin up spiritually i slept beside of you i dreamt of you im being so honest and so sincere that ive got tears in my eyes its very difficult for an introvert to be able to open up to feel so comfortable to not care about the consequences i trust you i believe in you i think youve got a lot to offer and its more than okay to be scared were all scared im scared but its better to experience and take risks with a chance of getting hurt disappointed than to not experience at all you say the most beautiful things without realizing it you say you have a darkness we all do we all do but i love you and im stern about the fact that loving someone is loving all of them
4237689 noboru and i stopped talking my heart is broken so i need to be away ps im on 8 medicines now isnt that just great a different psychiatrist showed me my hospital discharge sheet it read bipolar i was confused he talked to me read my journal and diagnosed me schizoaffective so now im on 3 kinds of antipsychotics an antidepressant a mood stabilizer calcium pills that are supposed to help me quit drinking i havent drank since sept 4 klonopin and sleeping medicine my life rules

4237706 feelings arent like a light switch you cant just shut them off and on
4237707 im feeling very tired the first time around i could put my feet up and relax this time i have a baby to run after and carry
4237708 being the richest man in the cemetery doesnt matter to me going to bed at night saying weve done something wonderful thats what matters to me
4237709 im not really over her yet we still hang she was just out with me a couple days ago and we were having a great time shes really got it i think shes great
4237710 the reason for destruction of all my relationships is that im passionate about being on the road and making music
4237711 i have great relationships but the women i date dont realize that i spend between 6 and 8 months of my life on the road touring or traveling or seeing family with my daughters
4237712 wait till they travel on a bus and are living in and out of a suitcase under the bay of the hotel
4237713 you know theyre going to show up here with 14 suitcases when you can fit about one i have two pairs of jeans you learn to live like that its a whole different life
4237714 i tell them look were dating theres no white picket fence its not like all of a sudden the shows over and the next day were married and that kind of thing
4237715 whoever he decides to pick from season 3 is going to have to accept that as well because she comes with it
4237716 e exasperarea de care avem nevoie pentru a nu disparea din istorie intr un nor de praf auriu cu un alai de lautari alaturi
4237717 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
4237718 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
4237719 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
4237720 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
4237721 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
4237722 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
4237723 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
4237724 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
4237725 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
4237726 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
4237727 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
4237728 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
4237729 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
4237730 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
4237731 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
4237732 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
4237733 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
4237734 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
4237735 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
4237736 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
4237737 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
4237738 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
4237739 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
4237740 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
4237741 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
4237742 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
4237743 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
4237744 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
4237745 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
4237746 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
4237747 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
4237748 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
4237749 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
4237750 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
4237751 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homophobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
4237752 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
4237753 my life is pretty much packed into my racquet bag
4237754 maybe indeed what president bush said was based on earlier information and later the situation changed and the speech did not

4237766 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010

4237785 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
4237786 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4237787 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4237788 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4237789 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4237790 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4237791 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4237792 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4237793 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4237794 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4237795 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4237796 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4237797 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4237798 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4237799 activision blizzard is committed to making the best games possible and has elected at this time to reduce the number of titles that radical is developing from four games to two

4237805 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
4237806 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4237807 weve had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems
4237808 when you come home from work everything drains away from you because its so quiet and peaceful
4237809 now we are going to have to listen to those windmills whoosh whoosh whoosh
4237810 when new courses are approved the english text has to be prepared at the same time
4237811 the french version of the third textbook was still unavailable during the summer
4237812 we didnt want to announce anything until we knew we could do it
4237813 you look at the english market in quebec for an ontario and b c publisher its not worth their time
4237814 wir verstehen den gerechten zorn den jeder anst ndige mensch in diesen tagen versp rt und trauern zusammen mit euch der toten und verdammen die georgische f hrung die auf niedertr chtigste und t ckischste weise die gewalt einer t dlichen waffe auf die schlafende stadt zchinwali niederlie wenn wir fr her noch die hoffnung hegten die br derlichen v lker ossetiens und abchasiens berzeugen zu k nnen in einem einheitlichen staat zu leben so verstehen wir jetzt genau dass das unm glich ist
4237815 die zeit alle wunden heilen wird und die v lker georgiens ossetiens abchasiens und russlands als gute nachbarn leben werden
4237816 i said do you want me to lie to new management
4237817 i suggest to you it was a pep talk and thats exactly what it was it was a discussion to encourage you and tell you youd never be fired and you had a place at livent
4237818 to think hed have anything to do with q2 as executive vice president of canadian operations was brain dead wasnt it
4237819 i suggest to you that you never sent it up to myron and you have no idea what happened with the schedule
4237820 gord and maria would not deal with it and he moved it up to myron
4237821 other than the fact i send the schedule upstairs that was the extent of my knowledge of how it got dealt with
4237822 i suggest to you that you quite wrongly suggested that mr gottlieb had anything to do with the explanation to the auditors it was out of his scope
4237823 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4237824 i know my music inspires people but you can always do more

4237833 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4237834 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4237835 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4237836 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4237837 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4237838 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4237839 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4237840 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4237841 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4237842 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4237843 our sales force is working on a large number of clearly identified projects which highlights the interest of potential customers in our solutions
4237844 we intend to be prudent during these uncertain economic times but we remain highly motivated to continue our strong growth and become the world leader in digital publishing solutions
4237845 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4237846 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools

4237873 theyre deciding on paternity leave but nobody in australia really knows what effect it may have if dads stay home with their children
4237874 we need to bring fathers into the discussion but the research isnt there
4237875 the chances are that we are using a lot of energy and taxpayers money throwing money at problems without being able to address them effectively
4237876 we know that fathers have an effect on literacy and breastfeeding rates but usually the lactation consultants only talk to the mums
4237877 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship to motherhood
4237878 the debate has been largely framed from the mothers perspective either from a traditional standpoint that its womens work or from a feminist standpoint that its definitely womens work
4237879 the whole area of male role models fatherhood male involvement in childrearing has never been sufficiently investigated and needs attention
4237880 gender roles are changing and couples with children are having to navigate and negotiate that
4237881 would you like to use a gift or merchandise card or apply a coupon
4237882 this report is rubbish from start to finish i think the author himself said it might be a bit barmy it is barmy i gather hes off to australia the sooner he gets on the ship the better
4237883 this report is rubbish from start to finish i think the author himself said it might be a bit barmy it is barmy i gather hes off to australia
4237884 i think he barry showed in the second minute what he can do and thats what the celebration was about we love gareth we want him to stay and hopefully he does
4237885 we just try to get on with it if gareths there im happy if hes not there one day i will be disappointed but good luck to him
4237886 its good obviously its my first game back and i wasnt even expected to be training until next week so ive done well to come in
4237887 they didnt really make it easy for us by any means these games can be hard when you dont really know much about the opposition
4237888 economic conditions were difficult in much of the developed world and third quarter revenues came in at the low end of our expectations but we were able to quickly adapt to the changing economic environment and our adjusted net income came in just above the high end of our expectations
4237889 we anticipate tough conditions in much of the developed world and slowing though still robust growth in developing asian markets
4237890 ah foi bom te ver aqui voc n o o cara da inform ica

4237898 go therefore into every nation teaching them to observe what i have commanded
4237899 the roads in illinois will be a safer place and immigrants can drive to church to work and take their children to school legally and without fear
4237900 why are you talking about a driving privilege for folks who cant register to vote
4237901 lets just knock down the borders and give everybody a certificate and say hey thanks for being here
4237902 i think that is always a possibility but i dont think as a practical matter that will happen
4237903 they are here illegally they broke the laws they dont deserve to drive
4237904 how in the world can we expect our laws to be enforced across the board if we keep handing out freebies this is a freebie
4237905 9 11 01 is still very fresh in my mind
4237906 the roads in illinois arent as safe as they could be
4237907 in my opinion this bill does not add to the problem it takes steps to correct the problem
4237908 i ask you today dont forget where you come from its from the families of immigrants
4237909 this country was built on the blood sweat and tears of immigrants who came to this country looking for opportunity
4237910 time warners short sighted decision to abandon netscape shows technology decisions are long term ones and companies that want to create value in that market need to look beyond quarter to quarter earnings

4237912 there was a possibility to run much faster but the pace in the first half was very slow the pacemakers were not so good so i am ok i was fine and i was good on the last lap
4237913 i think kipchoge and sihine they didnt do a good job
4237914 i have not done speed work and they should have run much faster i dont understand why they were waiting for me to make a move i am coming from the marathon i think they should have gone faster than me of course i prepared very seriously for the race to qualify for the olympics what can i say i am ok
4237915 he can run a lot faster it was very warm about 25 degrees and windy i think haile can run 26 30 or 26 40
4237916 now it looks like i have a ticket for bejing
4237917 but it depends on my federation my federation they could say no
4237918 what they told me was maybe there is a better athlete
4237919 the 10 000m is not an easy event beijing will be hard
4237920 we will see the 10 000m of course is a big event at the olympics it is possible for me to run like 26 35 or something like that
4237921 i have to find a place to prepare for the beijing olympics that has similar weather to beijing
4237922 i am looking i havent found a place yet i dont know where i will go

4237925 the second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed but this as has been seen means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress this is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government
4237926 the bill of rights was almost entirely a declaration of individual rights and the second amendments inclusion therein strongly indicates that it too was intended to protect individual liberty
4237927 we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4237928 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4237929 the planet is fine the people are f ed the planetll shake us off like a bad case of fleas
4237930 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4237931 our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think suffering follows an evil thought as the wheels of a cart follow the oxen that draws it our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think joy follows a pure thought like a shadow that never leaves

4237933 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not

4237940 what differentiates abortion after prenatal diagnosis and abortions for sex selection from all other abortions is that abortion is a response to characteristics of the fetus and would be child and not to the situation of the woman
4237941 expresses negative or discriminatory attitudes not merely about a disabling trait but about those who carry it
4237942 a single trait stands in for the whole the trait obliterates the whole the tests send the message that theres no need to find out about the rest
4237943 expressive externalities that the ada could have generated with respect to the practice of disability selective abortion
4237944 the adas affirmation of social equality and disability rights discourages disability selective abortion by tempering negative attitudes toward people with disabilities according to this hypothesis the ada by barring employment discrimination and assuring access to public serivces and accommodations conveyed to parents the promise that prospective children with disabilities could lead happy and productive lives
4237945 the ada by requiring sometimes onerous workplace adjustments for persons with disabilities led to a media backlash driven by commercial employers on this account disapproving stories about people with disabilities covered widely by print and television sources combined with detailed news reports on selective abortion procedures to convince parents that children with disabilities would not be accepted into the world as social equals
4237946 two well known disabilities for which prospective parents do not routinely screen
4237947 so what you can email into a lotus notes database
4237948 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat

4237950 the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years
4237951 they didnt have to we all knew we had serious problems especially at dinner time we were on the verge of hunger so i went to work
4237952 i rode my bike nine miles there and back every day
4237953 in the winter i hitch hiked there was no bus service
4237954 they had to cut back and the bottom fell out of everything
4237955 we had no money thats a horrible situation to be in
4237956 you havent seen boredom until somebody hands you a jug of water and a hoe at 8 a m and has you work all day in a 40 acre field of potatoes i didnt like it i did it to survive
4237957 i kept 5 for myself and sent 40 to my family
4237958 i loved lockport high school even in my short time there i left with a lot of skills i could type make a mechanical drawing write and spell and they made me love to read
4237959 hes done a lot for a man without formal training in an age when everyone feels they need to be certified before doing anything its nice to look at someone like dad who just figured it out and did it
4237960 we want to help doctors be healthy and enjoy their career in medicine
4237961 the healthy practices podcast is one of the many forward thinking tools and services that the cma offers physicians to help them thrive in the ever changing world of medicine
4237962 physicians often do not consider their own health a priority
4237963 but it is the foundation for providing good health care to their patients i am very pleased to be part of this progressive online program that provides practical and essential information to help physicians better manage their own health and wellness
4237964 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4237965 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4237966 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4237967 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4237968 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4237969 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4237973 doujon zammits tale shocked us all both for the brutal and unfair manner of his loss but also for the generosity subsequently displayed by his father despite his heavy pain
4237974 the donation of doujons organs is a shining example not only for greeks but for australian citizens as well
4237975 the coastguard has been suspended and his dismissal from the special forces has been ordered
4237976 ive been driving it good the last couple of weeks but today i hit it all over the joint
4237977 when i hit the fairway i hit it close and thats where my birdies came from this is a course where you can get it on the green from not hitting the fairway
4237978 it doesnt matter how good you hit it youve got to hole the odd 10 footer to keep your momentum going and i just didnt hole any of them its not like i missed one or two i missed all of them
4237979 the key for me is getting it in the fairway off the tee
4237980 it doesnt matter how much you work at changing your swing it seems you want to go back to your old stuff its been a pretty big change for me trying to get some different things firing at different times
4237981 mr talansky will not come to israel he is ready to cooperate the israeli and american governments could eventually find a solution
4237982 there is a criminal investigation in the united states by the civil grand jury investigation on mr talanskys activities linked to the olmert affair
4237983 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4237984 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4237985 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy
4237986 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4237987 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4237988 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro
4237989 since then the greenback has improved by 6 9 percent

4238021 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4238022 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4238023 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
4238024 accordingly a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with known criminals
4238025 i have been told and i accept that a body of intelligence has been obtained throughout the general course of purana investigations which impacts directly upon the integrity of the racing industry in this state
4238026 many of the bookmakers who engaged in betting activity with suspicious persons were motivated by the opportunity to make substantial profits in particular where the betting client was prepared to make extravagant bets yet appeared to have limited betting success
4238027 money laundering is probably the main type of offence we find in the racing industry
4238028 its really important for the industry to be clean and be perceived to be clean

4238041 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4238072 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4238073 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4238074 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4238075 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4238076 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4238077 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars
4238078 in any geographic area its a natural phenomenon for oil to peak at some point
4238079 the peak oil theory looks at the u s experience and believes the world will peak also
4238080 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it
4238081 i dont believe in the cataclysm if you have a sharp drop in production and prices increase you will get major substitutions in the demand for oil
4238082 the problem with the transportation sector is that oil supplies 97 percent of its energy and theres no viable substitute unless the price of oil gets high enough its knocking at that door now and were starting to see tangible indicators of a switch
4238083 americans are competing with asia and the rest of the world not just for fuel but for materials and food as well thats the world were in
4238084 as was the case with the u s oil peak we wont actually know until it is in our rearview mirror

4238089 the wire has never received an emmy nomination for drama series a crime almost as heinous as the ones that were perpetrated each week on this gritty baltimore cop show
4238090 the wire the complete fifth season 60 a dvd that preserves all 10 episodes in the finale of this hbo classic
4238091 the wire deserves the nobel prize for literature even david simon co creator of the series bemoans the lack of awards during the commentary track that accompanies the final episode which incidentally did receive an emmy nomination for its writing
4238092 the wire the last word focuses specifically on the industry giving several real editors and reporters including klein jacob weisberg of slate and steve luxenberg of the washington post the chance to offer their opinions on the state of the media today its not a pretty picture
4238093 the wire odyssey is semi entertaining and the six commentary tracks are informative especially to marylanders who get a kick out of all the shout outs to the real baltimore personalities and places that pop up in the episodes
4238094 the wire is used to wanting more as satisfying as this last season was we still want more mcnulty more daniels and more multi faceted stories from that rough very real city and of course more emmy nominations

4238101 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4238102 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4238103 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4238104 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4238105 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4238106 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4238107 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4238108 on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security

4238115 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4238116 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control

4238264 some will be against this and some will be for it
4238265 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
4238266 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
4238267 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

4238286 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4238287 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4238302 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4238303 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4238304 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4238308 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4238309 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4238321 it doesnt matter how good you hit it youve got to hole the odd 10 footer to keep your momentum going and i just didnt hole any of them its not like i missed one or two i missed all of them
4238322 the key for me is getting it in the fairway off the tee
4238323 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4238324 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4238325 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4238329 i like it when robots do the djing at kure not college kids
4238330 on my way home i was digging the college radio kure 88 5 fm to be exact iowa state universitys college radio station has always been pretty decent but ive never really committed completely mostly because i switch to a cd or my ipod out of embarrassment for the dj on the radio they talk too long about nothing just to hear the sound of their own voice or blurt out some inside joke only their roommate will understand thats not all of them no and even if it was theres also the issue of musical taste
4238331 man the bot was kicking so much ass i thought it had to be a real dj but lo and behold it was the bot
4238332 why not let the humans pick the songs and the robots do the talking they are much better at it plus save your human talents for things like talk shows band interviews special editions and the very highest quality specialty shows college radio is a great thing not enough people use or know about it used to be a bastion of college antics today it just seems forgotten branch out college radio take risks think of it kures new slogan picked by humans spun by robots
4238333 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses

4238428 they showed no remorse for their crime and they are dangerous to the community
4238429 there were well over a dozen attempts for them to come out
4238430 they didnt care about move getting out of that house
4238431 the importance of all life human life animal life plant life thats coordinated to work together to keep life going there is nothing more important than that
4238432 but those who run this system have spit on life they dont see life as important at all their belief is obviously opposed to life and thats why were in conflict with the system this systems belief is money and status and they put money and status over life
4238433 we would expose them for being against life being liars and misleading people
4238434 there was no let up we have been through all types of dissonance by the system
4238435 it was the day that was coordinated for us to make the public aware of all that move had been through at the hands of the system
4238436 they said were going to make widows of your wives and i hope youre paid up on your insurance they made good on their word with the killing of ramp and injuring several others
4238437 it was to show people that these cop are cowards and punks
4238438 when they feel like they can come up on you and youre defenseless and they got weapons they will attack you like the cowards that they are but when they feel like youre in a position to defend yourself they dont mess with you
4238439 the blockade was to keep them from entering or exiting
4238440 we had warrants for some of the members some of the people did leave saying they didnt want any part of it it was a peaceful way for them to exit the house
4238441 our children were crying the dogs were barking the neighbors were alarmed bright lights were glaring into our home the sound of cops marching down the street 600 strong with heavy artillery threatened us to come out of our home under the guise that they had warrants for the arrest of people who werent even in the house it was all a set up just to have an excuse to attack us they drilled holes into our home so they could have better access to kill us they had the crane and bulldozer tearing down our house literally while we were in there
4238442 we didnt want any confrontation george fencl the top peacemaker of the police department was there
4238443 police were seen on national television putting weapons into the house to set us up
4238444 lynne abraham as usual dismissed it and tried to put blame on us they came to our homes to kill us they will use all manner of tactics even if it means to lose one of their own
4238445 how in gods name can anybody shoot a person in the back of the head when hes facing you
4238446 when it came time to review james ramps autopsy the prosecutor wilhelm knaur penciled in from left to right to change the way the bullet entered
4238447 the judge malmed allowed it because of his arrogance hatred and racism toward the move organization he said we shot him as a family so well be sentenced as a family
4238448 if they thought for one second that move people killed james ramp on aug 8 1978 they would have preserved every bit of evidence to prove it in court
4238449 they destroyed the scene of the crime which is a crime to destroy evidence the house became a murder scene which is more reason why youre supposed to secure it and not allow anything to be done to it they demolished it
4238450 any bullet that theyre saying came from move hitting ramp would have to be on an upward angle
4238451 move people were in a basement ramp was on street level theyre lying they know move didnt kill that cop
4238452 it was really sad that people werent more outraged about the parole denials
4238453 i thought it would spark an uproar what kind of society releases thousands of rapists and child molesters into society while vilifying and spitefully keeping men and women in prison for decades
4238454 i spent a lot of time visiting them in jail
4238455 i was able to see the way they were presenting things they were making things up to conform to martyrdom move says ramp was shot by other officers what about the other officers who were shot when you look at it in totality the defense of the move 9 falls apart
4238456 they spent the better part of their adult lives incarcerated and there was insufficient evidence to convict them at trial the real issue is do they pose a threat to the community now and i dont think they do that needs to be the focus of the parole board
4238457 its not true that they killed a cop but how many people have these cops killed when they talk about gun control and talk about guns in the hands of the people they aint talking about controlling the guns these cops have people really need to focus on where the real threat is move aint no threat we aint murderers but these cops are
4238458 where does the parole board get off demanding that somebody say theyre guilty especially when for 30 years now they have told you they are innocent
4238459 why should we show remorse for something we didnt do
4238460 what did we do we were inside our home in our basement i had my breastfeeding baby in my arms life is our belief we dont believe in killing in any form including cops
4238461 we give thanks to john africa that we have been able to withstand the stress
4238462 nothing they do has the effect on us they want it to one of the things that keeps us going is were not criminals we truly are political prisoners
4238463 they never presented any evidence about them being shot the only evidence they used to convict us is were move members are we on trial for being move or killing a cop
4238464 it was an example of what the american justice system is like
4238465 its not about justice its not about fair aug 8 was strictly about getting rid of the move organization
4238466 when we walked to the parole board hearing the first thing i saw was hate in their eyes
4238467 i went in there just as strong and militant as i was 30 years ago im just in the worst situation possible they got me locked up in an 8 by 11 foot cage but when i think about my family and my children i always get filled with hope
4238468 as people begin to take interest the more pressure the system will begin to feel
4238469 the pressure caused by people realizing the injustices is whats going to release us

4238508 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4238509 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4238510 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4238511 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4238512 i dont think the trend of today rounds of 5 under or 4 under are going to continue the rest of the week
4238513 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4238514 the foreclosure boom has been going on for years now its at crisis level depression era level

4238526 the answer was clear al franken will stand up for womens health care

4238545 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
4238546 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
4238547 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
4238548 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
4238549 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
4238550 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
4238551 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
4238552 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that

4238556 our first quarter fiscal 2009 financial performance declined year over year largely because of the interest rate climate a factor impacting our entire industry
4238557 we increased the provision for loan losses this quarter as our non performing loans increased led by our multifamily and commercial loans categories
4238558 we have made significant progress with our plans to improve efficiency beginning this fall we will begin to offer residential loan products through a third party provider phh mortgage corporation via our branches the internet and our call center in addition we will make application to our regulator at the end of this month to consolidate two of carvers retail branches into a single location if approved we will complete this step at the end of the calendar year we will continue to pursue additional strategic initiatives to improve return on equity

4238561 the fact remains that there are iphone 3g customers in the netherlands and in other countries who believe that the user experience on this device is not enough
4238562 here in switzerland we have very mature 3g networks with excellent coverage yet side by side in the same office on the same network the iphone 3g has no 3g service while all other 3g phones have maximum signal and happily place and receive calls and dont drop any
4238563 it could be the chipset it could be how theyve implemented it there could be a lot of things
4238564 phone code is probably the most difficult to do per line of code of any code that i can think of almost everybody who has built an operating system for mobile phones it has taken them a number of years to mature it its just a process everybody has to go through
4238565 in terms of radio reception ive noticed that the iphone 3g will take longer than normal time to re associate itself and in some cases where i know theres a signal it just wont find it in some cases it has weaker reception than with other phones

4238691 as the world reaches a threshold with modern science and its failures to provide for a relaxed functional state of mind people are turning to old and ancient methods to achieve that paradigm until now nobody created a scientific meditation that held solid ground reflecting its mechanism and therapeutic effects
4238692 in this age of technology humans are likely to be challenged by the very advancement they desire such as autonomy of computers to achieve certain solutions which some people will find hard to accept and deal with which in turn will be detrimental to self esteem and confidence

4238694 personally i think norton is one of the most annoying programs ever created and its so hard to deal with
4238695 windows live onecare seemed to be over engineered and it created serious problems for us it seemed to randomly change the network settings on certain pcs without our knowledge and other so called brand name products were just as bad
4238696 our pcs are used for point of sale pos customer support and accounting so its vital that theyre fully protected pretty much every aspect of this business is dependent on our computers being up and running at all times a virus infection would effectively shut down the business
4238697 with a relatively small number of pcs hard costs are not a big issue for us
4238698 but soft costs like my time are extremely important so we really wanted to find an anti virus solution that would provide solid protection without needing a lot of administrative attention
4238699 through word of mouth i heard that some other small businesses were running avg and were very pleased with it
4238700 i decided to give it a try and contacted walling data online to talk about the product whether it would meet our needs and what pricing and licensing options wed be looking at

4238702 so i placed the order they helped us to deploy the software and it was all very quick and easy
4238703 i have had to take advantage of the free support a few times for minor things
4238704 walling data helped us to diagnose and fix the problems right then and there it was nice to be able to pick up the phone to solve an it problem on the spot especially considering the kind of time constraints i usually have
4238705 because we dont have a dedicated it department to handle software problems i was very happy to discover how easy avg was to manage
4238706 we have also found that avg doesnt have any impact on pc performance most of the time you dont even know its there and the price is fantastic
4238707 we were looking for something simple and unobtrusive that would keep our pcs secure without getting in our way and we found it in avg

4238710 how do you get workers to do the right things and do them correctly

4238714 the great thing is its not rocket science it simply leverages natural laws and human tendencies to reach people on the inside where it counts
4238715 its great when one single government program can address three major national problems
4238716 that we only had 115 miles per hour winds trees were down power lines were down and a lot of minimal to moderate roof damage was suffered but we werent wiped out like the gulf coast during katrina
4238717 the problem of job loss expensive insurance and natural disasters is affecting many areas of our country

4238719 this one can help many americans even taxpayers who end up paying for disaster relief as well as provide positive effects on the economy by putting hundreds of thousands of americans back to work
4238720 i am in favor of a national health program that guarantees that no american is denied needed care the disparity in our health care system is looking more like that in a third world country every day

4238790 many companies purchase several cases at a time we were aiming at this market but were not focused on it at this stage so to see this area take of is positive companies are ordering wine for their staff as well as to send to customers it makes a great gift we have also seen many restaurants and bars approach us to purchase bulk amounts of stock they have recognised the savings they can make on great wine without having to rely on wine auctions

4238814 back in 2002 mr ian smiley and i went to china with a bottle of home brewed and distilled moonshine at a local government welcome banquet we opened the bottle and passed the liquor around everyone liked the taste of it
4238815 it is almost like chinese traditional bai jiu white liquor but smoother and with a hint of sweetness immediately the head of the county mr jianguo han and mr guangqian hu wanted us to establish a distillery in their county they offered us tax incentives land usage license assistance right at the dinner table they made us an offer we simply could not refuse
4238816 liquor is a high tax revenue product for local provincial and the state government therefore they want the distillery
4238817 mr hu immediately pointed out that there is no chinese made whiskey on the market and all the imported whiskey aged in oak barrels has a strong oak taste which is very hard for chinese people to swallow he obviously recognized the high potential for moonshine whiskey in chinese market
4238818 china is a people country which means that the rules and regulations are often bent if the merit is evident the local government is willing to alter any regulations to push the project
4238819 my wife doesnt like the idea of producing moonshine and i am not a drinker
4238820 but mr han patiently pointed out to me that the moonshine project as the first whiskey distillery in china would bring not only employment to the local people but also boost the name recognition of his county and build its image attracting even more investment
4238821 if we can share 1 of the chinese liquor market we would be able to employ hundreds of people as well as spending millions of dollars at the local markets this would help local people tremendously since china is consuming about 4 9 billion liters 1 3 billion gallons of bai jiu white liquor a year
4238822 before the end of the year you will be able to bring a bottle of famous moonshine whiskey from china made from an appalachian recipe and distilled by a state of the art german distillery more than legally

4238847 we knew we had a business model that would work well but we never dreamed things would take off as quickly as they did things were changing so fast and we had to adapt constantly to keep up with the changes we just werent as prepared as we should have been
4238848 many people would have given up when faced with the same challenges we faced but that simply wasnt something we would consider we worked too hard to build 1800skyride it would have been even harder to give up on it than it would have been to just face the challenges and solve the problems
4238849 were better than we were a year ago and we will be even better a year from now
4238850 we still run across customers who have read about some of our former problems and this makes it more challenging to develop trust with the customer those situations just make it all the more rewarding when the customer is ultimately happy of course there are always some people that believe everything they read online and wont give me a chance to help them because they ran across complaints from other customers mixed in with exaggerated claims about how bad we were it is that little bit of truth about customer service problems from the past mixed in with the rumors that really make it challenging to restore a customers faith sometimes those are also some of the best calls though when you resolve it the customer is so happy and grateful i love those calls
4238851 management has really tightened up on procedures but most of us here at 1800skyride understand that this is the best thing for our customers everyone wants to be proud of the company they work for so the strict rules we have here to enforce good customer service just help create something we can all be proud of great customer service is not easy to provide but it is the most important thing im glad 1800skyride recognizes this and places such a priority on including ambitious customer service goals in the plans for growth
4238852 when we begin a reputation management project we keep that case secret these other companies that talk about contacting web sites with legal notices and asking them to remove content are putting their clients at risk if someone has an article on a web site that is deemed negative press and a reputation management company writes the site owner a letter asking them to remove the story the site owner is more than likely going to blog about the first amendment injustice thus creating more negative press on the web for the client that is why we work in the shadows
4238853 if you have a beehive hanging on your door step and you take a stick then knock it down you are going to have a lot of angry bees swarming around but if you apply a layer of smoke around the beehive the problem can be peacefully remedied if you contact a blog owner or site owner you are asking for a lot of angry bees swarming the web to spread your bad news
4238854 the collaborative problem solving cps model as applied to challenging kids sets forth two major tenets first that these challenges are best understood as the byproduct of lagging cognitive skills rather than for example as attention seeking manipulation limit testing or signs of poor motivation and second that these challenges are best addressed by teaching children the skills they lack rather than through reward and punishment programs and intensive imposition of adult will
4238855 while challenging kids let us know theyre struggling in some fairly common ways screaming swearing defying hitting spitting throwing things breaking things crying withdrawing and so forth they are quite unique as individuals when it comes to the mix of lagging cognitive skills that set the stage for these behaviors this means that prior to focusing on the teaching of cognitive skills one must first identify those skills that are lagging in each individual child or adolescent the teaching of these skills may be accomplished in a variety of ways but primarily through helping challenging children and their adult caretakers learn to resolve disagreements and disputes in a collaborative mutually satisfactory manner
4238856 cps can be applied to interactions between classmates siblings couples parents and teachers employees and supervisors and nations all people benefit from learning how to identify and articulate their concerns hear the concerns of others and take each others concerns into account in working toward mutually satisfactory solutions
4238857 cps promises to be extremely effective in helping us to deal with some of the thorniest real life issues faced by many if not most typical families not just those with explosive kids so we have begun to integrate these techniques into many of our recommendations and therapies
4238858 its hard to imagine anyone getting their day off to a good start when they have to wake up to the hideous sound of an alarm
4238859 and then all most people have to look forward to is commuting to a job that they probably dont like or arent satisfied with ill take being woken by my daughter over that any day no question
4238860 in the past things like my mindset and thoughts were just never even a blip on my radar

4238863 when our economy is taking such a hit why wouldnt you want to be involved in an industry that is flourishing
4238864 there are a lot of really unhappy people in the world who just want more out of life we not only offer products that can help them get there but we can also teach them the same marketing system that we have used to gain our freedom which can then facilitate dramatic changes in their lives its a no brainer
4238865 its a shame it really is just recently i saw several of my former coworkers lose their jobs to an outsourcing initiative if you follow the news it seems like there is a similar story every day
4238866 that is major reason why i made the decision to learn how to make money rather than how to earn it i didnt want my livelihood to be at the mercy of someone elses whim besides it is much more fun to get paid what im worth rather than what my employer thought my job was worth my days of trading time for money are long gone
4238867 people know whats going on they know that no matter how good they are the fact remains that their jobs are expendable
4238868 there is no more safety in corporate america and unfortunately career stability is a thing of the past offering a person the ability to take control of their success by providing them with a proven system that includes ongoing training and mentoring by self made millionaires is just something that most people want
4238869 it is great where else can you start a legitimate business have it up and running in a matter of days and have the ability to be profitable and recover all of your upfront costs within the first few months
4238870 i didnt want to wait that long to see a profit and i certainly didnt want to trade one job for another
4238871 it is great to have the ability to not only the help empower others so that they can change their lives but to also be able to lead them and teach them the same system that has allowed me to free myself
4238872 there is nothing better than giving someone the key to unlock their potential we give ordinary people the ability to achieve extraordinary things

4238904 its simple really we want to protect our clients and keep the value in our value selections
4238905 punters deserve to know why you have selected a horse why a horse is over the odds or why a favourite is a risk then they can factor in their own judgment can obtain a feel for each race and find runners that are well over their true odds of winning

4239192 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4239193 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4239194 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4239195 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4239196 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4239197 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4239198 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh

4239258 dinamo joaca in stil italian batem cu 1 0 si luam trei puncte care i problema
4239259 avand in vedere si valoarea echipei cu care am jucat rezultatului cred ca e unul bun ne da mari sperante pentru retur dar au fost momente cand am avut jocul in mana si puteam scoate un rezultat si mai bun am inceput jocul bine dar am facut greseli si le am permis adversarilor sa marcheze eu m am asteptat sa facem in continuare un joc cat mai ofensiv dupa golul doi sa nu le dam ocazia turcilor sa se dezmeticeasca
4239260 strategia era ca pe final sa i surprindem prin viteza si prospetime avand in vedere ca turcii nu stau inca bine la capitolul pregatire fizica niciodata nu am vrut sa ne inchidem si sa jucam ofensiv galatasaray a jucat foarte bine cand noi am gresit si am pierdut mingi in jumatatea adversa de acolo ei au plecat pe contraatac
4239261 ne gandeam la introducerea lui neaga stancu sau tiago din pacate s au ivit probleme medicale la golanski si a trebuit sa mi schimb strategia de mutari stiam de ovidiu petre ca nu poate duce un meci intreg si in locul lui ar fi trebuit sa l introduc pe tiago am hotarat introducerea lui ghionea pentru ca apareau foarte multe centrari de pe benzi si sorin are un joc de cap foarte bun nu am vrut sa ne inchidem sau sa ne baricadam prin aceasta mutare
4239262 in retur vom juca sa inscriem nu la 0 0 vom facea exact ceea ce trebuie pentru a ne indeplini obiectivul cand vin asemenea meciuri jucatoriis e mobilizeaza exemplar
4239263 acustica stadionului ali sami yen este una foarte buna dar sunt sigur ca atmosfera din ghencea va cel putin la fel de incendiara infernul din istanbul se va muta in ghencea indiferent de ce se intampla mi as dori ca publicul sa fie 90 de minute alaturi de echipa si sa o impinga de la spate
4239264 din punct de vedere tactic si al efortului depus pe teren merita apreciat in momentul in care se va adapta complet veti vedea ca este un jucator de care steaua va avea nevoie este un jucator harnic si sunt sigur ca va aduce un aport pozitiv in jocul nostru
4239265 este un atacant de mare calitate stie jocul tactic si tehnic iar solutiile pe care le alege sunt destul de bune cand vom reusi sa aducem mai multe mingi in fata portii si sa l punem in valoare atunci el va avea mai multe realizari
4239266 in jurul lui banel s a creat o atmosfera neprielnica care il afecteaza tactic a jucat foarte bine s a achitat de sarcini efort a depus ocazii a avut gol a dat ce sa i mai cerem lui banel sunt foarte multumit de banel la jocul de ieri lumea s a obisnuit atat de mult cu jocul lui banel incat acum vrea altceva
4239267 accidentarea de la iasi il va tine departe vreo doua trei saptamani nu va juca in returul din ghencea cand am aflat verdictul l am scos de pe lista uefa si l am adaugat pe ochirosii
4239268 dupa meciul de la vaslui si cel cu brasov am avut o discutie mai lunga cu zapata mi se parea ca nu e in apele lui am crezut ca are probleme personale despre care nu ne a spus mi a zis ca nu este nimic si important este ca si a revenit
4239269 am discutat cu el si i am explicat ca trebuie sa evolueze la fel si acasa si in deplasare in deplasare e mai pe varfuri ca balerina in ghencea am vazut un dayro intr o verva deosebita la iasi si la valsui mai balerina aseara a facut un joc foarte bun are calitati tehnice dar trebuie sa inteleaga ca fortbalul nu se joaca pe loc si ca trebuie sa faca si eforturi fizice nu poate sa faca doar faza de atac
4239270 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4239271 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4239272 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4239316 the value these business owners will receive for all of their hard work and investment is highly dependent upon how they approach and execute the sale process
4239317 failure to plan for this most important event can result in under selling your business or worse yet liquidation at a fraction of the going concern value
4239318 sadly many business owners do no planning or wait until they are burned out bored or in poor health and then hope for an employee or buyer to approach them they sell from the weakest position
4239319 but if these same owners had run their businesses year in and year out as if they were going to sell them they would be building value over time and positioning themselves to get the maximum value at whatever time the sale occurs lifes unexpected events can change an owners timing in an instant
4239320 due to confidentiality concerns owners instinctively feel that they should wait for that one right buyer to come to them you can run all the formulas and models you like but at the end of the day a business is worth what a buyer is willing to pay if you only have one buyer with no competition how do you know that he she is the one that will pay the most for your business
4239321 we have taken some of the processes that we use over and over in business sale transactions and made them available to business owners on an a la carte basis
4239322 what we see more and more frequently with the baby boomers is that they are thinking ahead they want to maximize enjoyment of life after business but they dont know how to prepare and are afraid to get advice for confidentiality reasons
4239323 business sales are heavily influenced by the last 3 to 5 year history the ideal time to begin planning is about 5 years out
4239324 its an exciting time for these baby boomer business owners
4239325 they have worked their entire lives to build these businesses and now its time for them to reap the benefits the exit planning process can re energize and refocus an owner as well as lead to a much more financially secure retirement

4239341 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4239342 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4239343 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4239344 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4239345 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4239346 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
4239347 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments

4239349 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team im inspired by other great athletes on the tennis team and in every team from swimming track and field everyone thats inspired me got me through this win

4239357 ive been unbelievably impressed at how hes handled that for four straight years that every time he goes on the court hes battling history hes not just facing an opponent that has absolutely nothing to lose hes facing pete sampras borg the records of so many before him i honestly dont know how he dealt with it for so long i think almost anyone in the world would crack under that pressure and he never has
4239358 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4239359 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago

4239361 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time

4239386 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author

4239388 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4239390 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4239391 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4239392 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4239393 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4239394 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4239395 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4239396 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4239397 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4239398 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4239399 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history

4239464 ordinarily a parent is both the legal and biological parent of a child
4239465 but there are many circumstances when this is not the case in the eyes of the law
4239466 this most obvious time is when an adult adopts a child who is not the biological parent
4239467 this is when a parent voluntarily gives up his or her right to a third party in an adoption or custody proceeding
4239468 if an adult identifies himself or herself as the parent of a minor child even though he or she is neither the legal nor the biological parent but the child believes him or her to be the parent bonding as such then the court will treat that adult as the legal or de facto parent meaning

4239480 our teacher recommended us to take this class because it will help our english
4239481 i like telling my story and my son loves my story
4239482 i like very much art because for me its therapy i need it
4239483 i would never have done it if i hadnt been here
4239484 i think the beauty of it and the fun of it is that you the viewer get to decide which is the beginning of the story and which is the end of the story there are only two frames but is this person opening the fist to reveal something to you or are they closing it and concealing it from you
4239485 in other words its very ambiguous on purpose and i like that part of it
4239486 i dont tell people what the message is or if theres a message but theres something there
4239487 i like things that arent what they appear to be things that are incongruous
4239488 you have to think about the photographs you can just look at them and say its a picture of a man big deal but generally theres something else so if you stop and study it and look at it you may see something beyond just the graphic image in front of you
4239489 combines two photographic images into a single frame which shift from one to another as you pass by creating the illusion of movement or change
4239490 ive wondered why arent i just taking regular pictures theres always a threat of this being a gimmick too but i wanted to deliver and share something a little more meaningful
4239491 pinhole is the simplest most primitive method of photography theres no nikon name its not digital its just capturing an image and yet pauls work tells a story too
4239492 a great benefit is that pinhole cameras dont have viewfinders so you aim the camera you have to let go of a lot of stuff and just take your chances
4239493 his gimmick is a pinhole camera and my gimmick is movable changing stuff but theyre not really gimmicks theyre techniques and without content theyre nothing
4239494 well friday is forecast to be the worst weather this week so you should be able to get in okay yesterday monday was a bit rainy and we didnt fill up until 7 30am
4239495 when a body is dredged from the san francisco bay the battles sleep deprivation diaper blowouts and breastfeeding mishaps to muddle through her own investigation mommy style
4239496 going back to the male teachers and the cheerleaders in booty shorts why should
4239497 was government relations with respect to patient care health promotion health policy
4239498 kernel of an idea grew into yes i really think i want to do this
4239499 about the job what it was like the good the bad and the ugly and i did say to the premier that i would like to run in may 2009 if there was an opportunity for me
4239500 i was totally out of it i had work lined up some really interesting things i was going to do i would have gotten more involved in the party and i would have done a whole lot of things but instead i did surgery chemo and radiation
4239501 the landscape had changed people were in ridings the liberals have to plan for the next election thats what they must do to have the best possible team so i found out there was an opportunity in vancouver fairview where there was a nomination there was one person running for that nomination but it wasnt by any means over and as i said not only is it eight blocks from where we live but its also the riding where the bcma is so thats where my work has been in vancouver and thats where all my places are its the neighbourhood we shop in eat go to the dentist doctor my church all those things are in the riding and its a lovely diverse beautiful place to live
4239502 my top area of interest is education and i think some people were surprised to hear that im always going to have been a doctor with 23 years of being a doctor so its not like i would suddenly lose interest in health
4239503 they could have had a good education from the beginning and im talking about literacy issues im talking about opportunities for early education as well as post secondary training
4239504 i think theres already really great direction now and i couldnt pretend to understand all the liberal policy or be articulate on all the liberal policy now i know there are a number of intiatives underway and i know literacy is one of the things that has great value put on it and efforts are being made to improving it because we still have a problem with that but what i would do if i was elected and i get to be a liberal mla i would be asked to do what im asked to do and i would do it so regardless of where my interest lies im going to have to become more familiar with all liberal policies much more in depth than i am now and then do what im asked to do and what im asked to do might be to go and be the best mla you can for vancouver fairview and thats what ill do i think the premier looks at the skill set of everyone that he has in caucus and uses those skills to the best of their ability and i think when you say youre going to sign on you dont decide heres what i want to do i mean you can express and i have already expressed to him this is what interests me the most but he might pick me to do something different and i bet you ill find it fascinating
4239505 closing the door to exploring new options for meeting some of those many shocking unmet needs
4239506 i felt that if we couldnt as physicians have a dialogue about healthcare and the healthcare systems where could you i think my concern at the time was that the debate was kind of being shutdown in the way that i think its often shutdown in the public as well where people use certain phrases just to cut off conversation
4239507 i do believe in a strong publicly funded healthcare system i do absolutely and i cant imagine a scenario where that would change ive just been a patient in that system and i know that in certain parts of the world people like me would end up being bankrupt but in canada when you have an illness like i had the system takes care of you
4239508 lo que hice fue motivado por el amor a mi patria y por la convicci n que la historia demuestra que es la nica opci n que le queda al pueblo cubano para evitar la muerte de inocentes personas y de la destrucci n que traen aparejadas las acciones terroristas que se cometen contra mi pa s
4239509 la fiscalia y as lo ha pedido que debo pasar el resto de mi vida en una c rcel
4239510 solo lamento no tener mas que una vida para entregar a mi patria
4239511 si por evitar la muerte de seres humanos inocentes si por defender a nuestros dos pa ses del terrorismo y evitar una invasi n in til a cuba es por lo que se me condena hoy pues bienvenida sea
4239512 ha sido este por encima de todo un juicio pol tico
4239513 he vivido al deber jure mis armas y ni una vez el sol doblo las cuestas sin que mi lidia y mi victoria viere
4239514 quisiera creer que usted entender el que yo no tenga razones para el arrepentimiento pero siempre sentir la obligaci n de pedir justicia para mis compa eros acusados de cr menes que no cometieron y condenados sobre la base de los prejuicios nosotros seguiremos apelando a estos valores y a la vocaci n por la verdad del pueblo norteamericano con toda la paciencia la fe y el coraje que nos puede infundir el crimen de ser dignos
4239515 our established service management tool already offers strong call logging serialisation and registration
4239516 combining sales history with a service record of emergency call outs and scheduled preventative maintenance for example
4239517 however in response to a growing service market looking to meet the needs of an increasingly demanding customer base we can now offer a more complete and proactive service management solution http www lakeview co uk accounting software linked directly to the businesss existing erp system for the first time therefore smes have access to an affordable service support capability which forms part of a fully integrated enterprise wide solution
4239518 these improvements are especially valuable for businesses managing a high level of calls and with a large number of different products customers and sites
4239519 in the past it was almost impossible to establish service based kpis equivalent to those already well established in sales logistics or the supply chain for example
4239520 in response our goal is to provide comprehensive real time management information enabling service directors and managers make informed decisions dependent on the size value and profitability of each individual client
4239521 helping people relocate their homes and offices across the country is a challenging logistical problem
4239522 and because of this it can be easy to lose track of the human dimension its equally important that we be available to answer customers questions and effectively resolve their complaints our new customer relations initiatives will make usa express moving as much a leader in customer care as we are in the moving business itself
4239523 we recognize that moving can be an incredibly stressful project
4239524 and at usa express moving were doing everything we can to make it simple and stress free we recognize that needs vary from a small business moving to a brand new office with minimal downtime to a family moving heirloom furnishings to a new home but the need for prompt responses to customer queries instant access to information and consistent service from top notch people is a constant when they move our customers know we can get their possessions where they need to be starting now they will have that same level of confidence in their ability to find out information from us on the status of their move the timing of delivery or any other pertinent information usa express moving has a great record of taking on tough new projects and were excited about the chance to make our customer experience even better
4239525 a 99 customer satisfaction rate is great but that other 1 can define how people think of your service
4239526 clearly the uup would rather keep on good terms with their new found friends than defend the orange institution from such scandalous attacks
4239527 mr elliott and his party would do well to tell us if they agree with comments such as this
4239528 also frankly im bored with the holier than thou orange order must never be criticised stance taken by so many unionists out there
4239529 clear their feelings regarding the orange institution and indeed ulster protestant culture clearly orangemen wont be welcome in a merged uup tory party
4239530 our focus is on the development of normal politics in this part of the uk we believe that people in northern ireland are concerned about the whole range of bread and butter issues some of which stormont are failing to address and others which labour are failing to address at westminster
4239531 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order
4239532 it had been erected by local republicans in memory of the hunger strikers and was located on waste ground
4239533 but it now has uvf painted over it in two places and the 10 crosses have been painted red white and blue
4239534 even those for hunger strikers which do not have planning permission

4239538 the chaos theory tells us that chaotic systems are systems that look random but arent
4239539 business operations fundamentally prove this theory the chaos theory suggests that a butterfly flapping its wings in brazil could cause a tornado in texas known as the butterfly effect likewise in business an individuals actions can impact the performance of the entire business both in good and bad ways
4239540 we believe that the oneplace chaos management solution is poised to revolutionize the project management and collaboration space
4239541 teams can prove it to themselves when they sign up for 30 chaos free days via unlimited access to oneplace at

4239556 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4239557 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4239558 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4239559 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4239560 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4239561 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4239562 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4239563 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4239564 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4239565 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4239566 just so you all know we did set a record
4239567 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4239568 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4239569 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4239570 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4239571 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4239572 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4239573 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4239574 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4239575 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4239576 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4239577 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4239578 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4239579 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

4239600 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4239601 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4239602 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4239603 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4239604 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4239605 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4239606 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4239607 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4239608 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

4239613 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4239614 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4239615 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4239616 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4239617 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4239618 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4239619 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4239620 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4239621 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4239622 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4239623 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4239624 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4239625 when ben silverman came in he loved the idea of celebrity apprentice he loved it right from the beginning so i would say it was a combination of ben and producer mark burnett and myself as an idea

4239632 be careful about reading health books you may die of a misprint
4239633 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4239634 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4239635 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4239636 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4239637 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

4239639 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4239640 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4239641 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4239642 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4239643 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4239644 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4239645 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4239646 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4239647 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4239648 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4239649 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4239650 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4239651 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4239652 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4239653 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change

4239662 greater clevelanders need real solutions to rising energy prices it should surprise no one that congressman kucinich and his colleagues have earned a single digit approval rating given their failure to address the high costs of putting gas in our cars and food on our families tables
4239663 while congress has departed on a five week vacation without providing relief to americas energy challenges i have outlined a substantive plan to address these issues and to help get the northeast ohio economy moving again
4239664 altering our driving styles and raising our taxes are not real solutions americas energy challenges
4239665 it is well past time for our nation to take charge of this issue and get on the road toward energy independence using the classic strengths of american manufacturing technology and innovation
4239666 the investigation into the double murders of benjamin and catherine mullany has been ongoing

4239675 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4239676 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4239687 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4239688 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4239689 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4239690 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4239691 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4239692 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4239693 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4239694 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4239695 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4239696 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4239697 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4239698 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4239699 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4239700 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4239701 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4239702 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4239703 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
4239704 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms
4239705 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions
4239706 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4239707 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4239708 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4239709 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4239710 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4239711 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4239712 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4239713 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4239714 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4239715 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4239716 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4239717 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4239718 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4239719 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4239720 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4239721 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4239722 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4239723 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4239724 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4239725 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4239726 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4239727 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4239728 these are all small things and they all add up
4239729 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

4239735 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4239736 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4239737 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4239738 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4239739 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4239740 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4239741 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4239742 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4239743 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4239744 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4239745 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4239746 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4239747 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4239748 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4239749 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4239750 both my daughter and i had been using the lip balm for two weeks faithfully

4239752 i am extremely pleased that christine has joined math solutions her extensive background in education and technology provides the vision and expertise to lead math solutions to our next phase of growth in professional development and publishing most importantly for us christine is a natural fit in our company culture and understands the importance of improving the teaching and learning of mathematics in our schools
4239753 my entire career has been focused on education because i believe it is a human right for all children to be educated and educated well through education a child has the freedom to create a life of economic prosperity and success i also believe it is through the influence of great teachers and creative learning environments that education flourishes math solutions is a great place to expand that spark between the teacher and the student to generate true learning

4239760 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4239761 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4239762 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4239763 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4239764 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4239765 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4239766 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4239767 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4239768 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4239769 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4239770 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4239771 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4239772 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4239773 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4239774 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4239775 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4239776 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4239777 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4239778 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4239779 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4239780 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4239781 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4239782 decades of fire suppression that allowed unsafe fuel loads to accumulate severe bark beetle infestations that are rapidly decimating trees and ever expanding human settlements in and near forests the result is increasing vulnerability to major fires
4239783 its something that needs to be considered in greenhouse gas emissions inventory as we go forward
4239784 unfortunately many of our policy makers dont seem to have taken that message to heart
4239785 we need to be looking at new policies that look to reduce the human footprint in forest landscapes
4239786 its not just california thats experiencing these problems its throughout the western united states
4239787 take steps to reduce global warming pollution from todays levels by at least 2 percent each year and by 20 percent by 2020 science tells us that this is the only way to hold warming to no more than 2 degrees fahrenheit in the next century
4239788 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4239789 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4239790 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4239791 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4239792 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4239793 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4239794 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4239795 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4239796 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4239797 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4239798 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4239799 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4239800 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4239801 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4239802 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4239803 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4239804 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4239805 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4239806 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4239807 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4239808 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4239809 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4239810 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4239811 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4239812 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4239813 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4239814 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4239815 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4239816 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4239817 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4239818 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4239819 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4239820 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4239821 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4239822 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4239823 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4239824 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4239825 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4239826 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4239827 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4239828 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4239829 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4239830 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4239831 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4239832 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4239833 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4239834 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4239835 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4239836 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4239837 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4239838 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4239839 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4239840 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4239841 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4239842 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4239843 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4239844 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4239845 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4239846 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4239847 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4239848 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4239849 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4239850 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4239851 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4239852 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4239853 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4239854 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4239855 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4239856 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4239857 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4239858 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4239859 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4239860 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4239861 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4239862 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4239863 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4239864 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4239865 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4239866 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4239867 we developed an xk with the chassis we fancied as our everyday driver
4239868 a bit more focused than our typical customer would usually want but still comfortable and safe in all road conditions including the wet
4239869 linda bollea to get 40 000 a month in alimony
4239870 while these accounts hold the hulksters money terry bollea doesnt control them instead theyre in the hands of his close friend and business partner eric bischoff
4239871 the more you upload hot new files the more exposure you will give your banners and ads
4239872 the liberty straw poll has been made possible though an accumulation of pro liberty grassroots efforts that utilize key internet technologies including online radio e commerce and web based social networking tools
4239873 our team doesnt take in any of the straw poll donations we are all unpaid grassroots activists with a love of individual freedom who each brings a different skill to the table to help make the project successful
4239874 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4239875 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4239876 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4239877 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4239878 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4239879 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4239880 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4239881 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4239882 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4239883 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4239884 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4239885 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4239886 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4239887 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4239888 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4239889 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4239890 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4239891 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4239892 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4239893 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4239894 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4239895 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4239896 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4239897 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4239898 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4239899 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4239900 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4239901 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4239902 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4239903 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4239904 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4239905 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4239906 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4239907 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4239908 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4239909 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4239910 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4239911 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4239912 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4239913 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4239914 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4239915 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4239916 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4239917 it could be a bit of a knock on the clean government issue in alaska she backed
4239918 right now in alaska all you have to do is say the word investigation and people are going to be running away
4239919 i would be very surprised if sarah palin didnt become a larger figure within national politics and i would be very surprised if she wasnt a part of a mccain administration
4239920 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt why is this guy still representing the department
4239921 from that point on ive had a concern this person could fly off the handle and do something terrible to the governor to her family or to the public
4239922 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
4239923 when i first started teaching in the early 80s parents thought i was magical by teaching their little six year olds spanish
4239924 todays savvy parents now look to me as the solution for bringing spanish into their home and their daily routine
4239925 we have the ability to provide parents homeschooling families and educators with a fun very affordable solution for implementing spanish
4239926 we have used the boca beth program for four years our students love the videos the cds coloring books and of course the maracas and puppets
4239927 our students have learned immensely from the program while our teachers feel it has been very helpful in their classes
4239928 with the school year starting now is the time to focus on helping kids learn a second language
4239929 the editorial positioning of these shows is so on target for
4239930 as for the nature of the conversations on buddhist geeks i see them like this imagine talking with an admirable inspirational teacher author or practitioner maybe over coffee or tea at some point in the conversation you naturally hit upon some amazing insights i think we try to capture that feeling in what we do we try to be very practical and yet personable in our interviews which i think is a distinguishing characteristic
4239931 three decades of management gurus have finally institutionalized innovation teamwork lifetime learning and missions that matter conscious business is the result
4239932 in an age of social networks and information overload every stakeholder has the potential to make or break the reputation of every business the businesses that succeed are now the businesses that serve
4239933 through the new man podcast weve learned that relationships improve careers improve and general well being improves dramatically for those men who are willing to be honest with themselves and quit settling for less than their potential and the exploration makes for a fun and entertaining listen too
4239934 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4239935 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4239936 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4239937 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4239938 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4239939 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4239940 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4239941 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4239942 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4239943 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4239944 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4239945 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4239946 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4239947 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4239948 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4239949 this property has been acquired for the ohare modernization program
4239950 is it frustrating that the clock now appears to be in the 11th hour absolutely
4239951 theyre literally ripping the social fabric out of this community
4239952 but someone cant tell you to leave this is america
4239953 this is about a national aviation process a bigger picture and the only way to solve the problem of delays and congestion is to build the full project
4239954 weve been very sensitive of the fact were displacing people
4239955 weve gone above and beyond to be customer friendly when weve impacted peoples lives
4239956 i think theres a sense of inevitability favoring the city
4239957 it seems more of a question of when the project will be finished rather than if

4239960 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4239961 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4239962 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4239963 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4239964 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4239965 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4239966 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4239967 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4239968 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4239969 this conduct is indeed more proximate to the creation of illegal copying than say operating an isp or opening a copy shop nonetheless we do not think it sufficiently proximate to the copying to displace the customers as the person who makes the copies
4239970 i brought two bags from home but there was a third that i left behind in this new country apart from the struggles that made me a stranger were your needs of the ones who bid me goodbye those i left behind among the papers i collected you had put a small bag of sweets i left behind there were divisions at home there were other possibilities there were communities in my town there were communities where i came i found a job called it a struggle for survival everything else i left behind i didnt want to forget my traditions the tradition of forgetting i left behind bags passport my shoes crossed the yellow lines something was left behind here i am a sum of different parts travel agents everywhere are selling ads for the parts that were left behind

4239978 as for us we need to prove ourselves as a duo but we do pose a threat on paper so well see
4239979 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4239980 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4239981 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4239982 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4239983 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4239984 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4239985 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4239986 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4239987 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4239988 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4239989 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4239990 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4239991 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4239992 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4239993 strong academic skills by requiring students to follow a very demanding global curriculum
