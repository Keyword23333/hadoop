7840004 a panel is going to kl tomorrow aug 27 to discuss this earlier in a visit to kl on august 18 special adviser to malaysias prime minister datu othman abd bin razak and i talked about it
7840005 we have requested both sides the philippine government and the milf to extend the term of the imt
7840006 this week is crucial we are worried about the conflict getting worse
7840007 we are worried that if the imt pulls out because then the peace process may collapse
7840008 what the afp did was a legitimate action its law enforcement
7840009 but we cannot restrain them if they are being attacked by government troops using indiscriminate air strikes from bomber planes fighter planes
7840010 appeal for peace emergency preparedness and response in the wake of the escalating conflict in mindanao
7840011 we are seriously considering going to court to stop the implementation of the mandatory tests the tests are clearly discriminatory against departing domestic workers
7840012 isnt it the height of lunacy that not one of the three officials have done anything about reports that innocent filipino citizens are being forced by their own embassy officials to accept crimes they did not commit just so they can escape abusive employers and go home
7840013 and to the disclosures of accused ofws being forced to plead insanity as the only legal defense offered by our embassy officials conejos has the temerity to brandish highly questionable data about maids on death row and submit psychiatric testing as the solution what a loony solution
7840014 this government would rather have our bagong bayanis as sacrificial lambs rather than risk their cheap labor export industry and the billions of dollars in remittance it churns out to save the economy
7840015 the psych test is indicative of what chair conejos will bring to the upcoming gfmd on october the government will merely pay lip service to protecting and empowering migrants
7840016 thus their psychiatric problems are largely environmentally induced not necessarily organic
7840017 we simply do not have the competence what will happen is that untrained personnel of diagnostic centers will end up administering and interpreting the test results thus the tests wont be effective
7840018 the ponente just gives a copy of the decision to the other members of the division if they agree with the decision they just sign the ponencia
7840019 it will be the first time that i will see that transcript
7840020 justice roxas said it is a transcript then he said that it was only a summary of the points you talked about on july 14 then you say that it is only an impression of your meeting which is which
7840021 they were only changing the date because he wanted to cover his reyess tracks

7840024 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7840025 low serum cholesterol is commonly observed in individuals with ill health e g cancer patients and those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as smoking and heavy drinking
7840026 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7840027 bei olympia trifft sich die jugend der welt zu freundschaftlichem wettbewerb
7840028 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7840029 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7840030 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7840031 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
7840032 open and frequent communication between parents and school staff is a key ingredient to keeping food allergic students out of harm it takes a partnership to establish effective avoidance strategies and emergency plans
7840033 parents should be aware of expiration dates and keep in contact with their allergist to insure that all medication especially self injectable epinephrine is replaced prior to expiration
7840034 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7840035 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7840036 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7840037 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7840038 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7840039 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7840040 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7840041 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7840042 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7840043 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from secondhand tobacco smoke
7840044 at the end of the day people who use incense casually i dont think thats a cause for major concern but those cultures which embrace incense as part of their daily lifestyles have to consider this has a real potential risk for cancer
7840045 a major factor has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
7840046 as you get more and more visual data the quantity become quality and as you get amazing amounts of data it starts to tell you things you didnt know before

7840051 given the regions dependence on airlift the most daunting issues facing the caribbean hotel industry are the rising cost of airfares and the announced cutbacks in air service
7840052 due mostly to the rising cost of fuel four of the five leading air carriers to the caribbean have announced cutbacks in service puerto rico and the dominican republic could see as many as 26 percent fewer flights in december of 2008 compared to december 2007
7840053 the caribbean has always been attractive to price sensitive travelers if airfares continue to rise hotels may have to reduce their room rates in an effort to maintain the caribbeans position as an affordable destination
7840054 right now and for the past few months everybody has been traveling which has been surprising to me
7840055 i think the high level of travel is due in part to the high population of jamaicans in cayman for the summer months many children have been going back and forth from there and international students also have been going there to get their visas
7840056 i thought before going to europe with all that is going on in the world that a lot of people wouldnt be traveling to europe this year but i was wrong it seems like people are setting aside funds to have a vacation and take time away from their everyday lives
7840057 despite the strength of the market we have seen shifts in the cruise industry that have been influenced by the rising cost of fuel cruises to more remote ports in the southern caribbean such as aruba are being cut from itineraries due to the length of the trip and fuel required to get there
7840058 there are theories about hormonal differences but none has been proved
7840059 its been documented in several studies that men are at increased risk of recurrence
7840060 this needs to be validated in a second study which we are currently planning
7840061 the study will take about two years to recruit patients and will have a one year follow up so results are expected in three years
7840062 one would be happy to be able to recommend stopping
7840063 the current recommendation is to remain on long term therapy but many patients elect not to do it
7840064 oftentimes patients choose not to take an anticoagulant blood thinner
7840065 so a physician might feel more comfortable to allow women with one or fewer of these risk factors to discontinue the medication
7840066 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7840067 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans

7840071 until people get sick they dont usually know its there
7840072 we think its the most underdiagnosed disease in the country
7840073 about 150 000 can expect to get sick some very much so
7840074 most people maintain just the right amount of iron in their bodies
7840075 it takes a while for even an astute physician to detect
7840076 its interesting how different the presentation is from patient to patient its such a jumble and thats what puts a burden on the general practitioner
7840077 were tying to get an iron test put in there so we can get at iron loading
7840078 ninety percent of the iron absorbed will go to the liver
7840079 if a person comes in and cant open their fist thats referred to as iron fist
7840080 heres a person who was able to tuck away the iron without it causing destruction of the organs
7840081 and yet there are other people who cant handle it
7840082 when you take blood out of the body iron stored in body tissue is used to make new blood
7840083 most people only are allowed to give blood once every seven weeks
7840084 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
7840085 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7840086 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
7840087 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7840088 often patients think psoriasis is just a rash but it is a systemic inflammatory disease with far reaching affects
7840089 patients should be aware of that and understand that controlling that systemic inflammation can help with other diseases
7840090 it really has made life much more tolerable for patients
7840091 theyre similar to chemicals or compounds we already have in our system they help lessen immune responses they help soak up or diminish the extra inflammatory compounds
7840092 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants
7840093 longer pollen seasons greater exposure and increased disease burden for late summer weeds such as ragweed
7840094 turtling was very difficult work but many caymanian families survived because of it my father travelled to the coast of nicaragua twice a month they worked according to the weather of course in those days there was no weather bureau or government storm warnings they used the sky as their weather service they were smart intelligent people and they could learn a great deal just watching the skies these are skills that are lost today
7840095 my mother was a housewife who had to look after five children by herself but being a housewife in those days had a far different meaning than it does today there were no washing machines of course my mother used a wooden washboard to scrub clothing by hand it was hard physical work we were poor but all of us were always in clean clothing
7840096 most of this grew in south sound so my mother and her friends would leave west bay at 2 00 am and get to south sound by 7 00 am there were no cars and no buses so she walked all the way when she got back in the afternoon we kids would help her lay the thatch out in the sun to dry it then we would weave it into everything from ropes and nets to hammocks it was very strong and would last almost forever by soaking it in salt water it became ever stronger so it was very popular with fishermen we sold it for cash money to jamaica
7840097 there was not much scrap wood to collect so my mother would use a heavy axe to chop up old tree stumps when i was 12 i used to help her do this and that is one reason why i am so tough today
7840098 except for when i caught pneumonia at age four ive never seen the inside of a hospital and rarely see a doctor the people of our generation all had to work hard every day so this tough nature is common with people of my age
7840099 the mosquitoes were so thick that the only way we could get to school was to carry small smoke pots which consisted of scraps of burning wood
7840100 for some animals it was just terrible the mosquitoes would cover their nose and mouths and they could hardly breathe some would even be smothered
7840101 mainly we just walked through the fields and along what we called cliff paths
7840102 one reason that cayman people speak fast is that we all love to talk we like to tell our stories and if you dont talk fast someone else will try to get their stories in ahead of yours
7840103 we all loved one another but we all would compete to tell our stories yes we were poor but we did the best with what we had
7840104 just a few weeks ago a police car was reversing and he was not looking where he was going and so he nearly hit me
7840105 i was very wrathful which is normally not like me but i was vexed and told him to be more careful in future asked if she wears a helmet she laughs and says no i dont wear a helmet but i do have a nice cap

7840109 all democrats salute sen hillary clinton for her excellent campaign our party and our country are strengthened by her candidacy
7840110 should obama go on to win colorado it would almost force mccain to run the table with the remaining battleground states or lose the election
7840111 i enjoy going diving fishing and spend time at the beach
7840112 to turn our backs on that and say well wed rather do things the old way its kind of like when they came out with penicillin to say well you know that sounds very nice but i think well stick with the leeches
7840113 the lofty goal is that every child in south carolina will get the best treatment period
7840114 so we can get there one day what this means though when youre using something this specific and that has this much evidence behind it is that youre going to reduce the length of time in treatment and youre going to increase the benefit
7840115 so we can talk about lower costs more cost effective care higher recovery rates so hopefully less starting and stopping starting and stopping maybe fewer behavioral problems that kind of thing can really spiral out of control if somethings not treated or if youre just getting minimal treatment
7840116 i knew a lot already about the individual pieces but to have a whole model thats a step by step program that you can look through and brings everything you already knew all together in something coherent its really helpful
7840117 he came upon a beautiful escarpment of coloured rocks something he hadnt seen before and went over to have a look maybe strayed off the track a bit and some huge lizards came out
7840118 wild animals had attacked him and he was covered in wounds
7840119 flies had bitten him he ended up with maggots in his wounds which is a good thing people are saying but they ended up laying eggs in the good layers of the skin as well
7840120 he has several medical problems all interacting with each other and has a long way to go
7840121 both he and lynne are very happy with the care he is receiving and the australian embassy has been very supportive
7840122 its better news today because its been a couple of terrible days
7840123 if what is in my head is in my heart and is what i speak then i am on the right path
7840124 waar het om gaat is dat we zoveel mogelijk informatie behouden voor de wijkbureaus die er misschien later wat aan hebben dat proces kan nog beter en daar gaan we voor zorgen
7840125 denk bij die inschattingen aan mensen die bellen over overlast of aan dat telefoontje over die gele scooter die steeds bij een beller door de wijk rijdt verduidelijkt zandbergen
7840126 het kan ook zijn dat je ineens een reeks ongeruste ouderen aan de lijn krijgt blijkt een paar dagen later dat er oplichters aan het werk zijn
7840127 dan hebben we het over zon 40 000 telefoontjes per maand waarvan 80 procent binnen 20 seconden moet zijn opgenomen en dat aantal groeit snel soms gaat dat prima maar er zijn ook piekmomenten waarop je dat niet haalt

7840133 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
7840134 it is apparent that euro dollar is becoming more sensitive to downside surprises in eurozone economic data than us negative surprises
7840135 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7840136 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7840137 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7840138 i personally believe the euro is more negatively affected than other currencies by a deepening row between russia and western countries over georgia

7840216 i explained that i was that close in the polls and that had we had some money at least to do more advertisement to get the message out there that it might have made a difference
7840217 i was there to tell the truth about what happened with the money and the fact that it came and went and it was no benefit to my campaign
7840218 i watched a lot of the olympics especially the swimming events theyre amazing we stayed up late every night to watch michael phelps get his eight gold medals

7840220 my timings in practice have been pretty good and i feel that im ready to compete
7840221 i have trained very hard and i hope it will pay off
7840222 i think the most success ill have is in the 50 m freestyle and the 100 m breaststroke those are my two best events
7840223 i really want to medal my mom and dad think that i have a very good chance of doing that in the 50 m freestyle and if i can push myself hard over the next few weeks i think i can make it happen the most important thing for me though is to get some personal best times and if that turns into a medal then thats fantastic
7840224 i really want to thank my parents for all their support over the years
7840225 i also want to thank my sister and all my friends for understanding when i couldnt hang out with them or talk with them for a while because of my training i also want to thank everyone from stephenville and around the province for their support and i want to thank god for getting me this far and helping me through my entire life
7840226 we see this display as a great opportunity to educate the people about these fish
7840227 they are a species of special concern to us one of the reasons is because they are non migratory this means that if the fish we have in this area were killed that would be it no other fish would migrate to this area to replace them
7840228 we have ten known locations of these fish across newfoundland but they do exist in the united states as well
7840229 these fish are usually found in what is called brackish water which is a combination of both salt and fresh water
7840230 in protecting these fish we are helping our ecosystem to achieve a certain level of biodiversity
7840231 before anything bad happens to this fish we want to find out more about it
7840232 we found lots of information that we never thought we would come across
7840233 some elders remember winters where the snow was piled so high you could actually sit down on the tops of telephone poles they believe that global warming has drastically changed that
7840234 one of the major problems the elders discussed was how technology has caused the closeness of the community to drift away
7840235 people arent as involved with each other as they once were because everything that needed to be done such as paying bills could be done directly from home with the internet however whenever someone was in need the community would still come together to help them
7840236 this whole project was founded on people really putting time in even when they were busy
7840237 if we cant take 1 500 here to fix up a ballpark wall or 500 there to buy some uniforms for a ball team in need then we better just stick to what were good at spending lots of taxpayer money on fribulu friluvi fru on nothin
7840238 i know a lot of people are maybe going to want to lynch me
7840239 but its like this if we accept this money where does it stop we might get addicted to it like were already hooked on taxpayer green stuff then where will we be when were out of office and nobodys giving us money for nothing so we better just stick with spending taxpayer money like were already doing this bernstein bear fellow needs to give that money someplace it would be useful like to our pension fund
7840240 but if we dont take this offer and keep paying for tests here and tests there arent we just paying peter to rob paul
7840241 do you want to be seen taking free money on a syndicated investigative program that kind of frightens me
7840242 some men were afraid to cross the delaware river with general washington at valley forge
7840243 oo oo im afraid commissioner defreese oo oo somebody might see me take the free money commissioner defreese well i guess some knox county commissioners are just girly men fine do it your way just remember you havent heard the last of me ill be back
7840244 id just like to say that im not the smartest person in the room but i know how to make money and its not with nobody robbing me and ill stand by that
7840245 does a butterflys wings beating in china cause a tornado in kansas
7840246 ive heard they say theyre all about chaos theory but it sound more like existentialism to me
7840247 when you have a group called knox chaos theory they need to be both chaotic and theoretical
7840248 ill agree that theyre pretty chaotic but theyre not theoretical they are very real i even pinched the petition drive member to make sure
7840249 i may have been for accepting free money to not waste taxpayer money at the greenwaste site
7840250 but before i was for accepting free money to avoid wasting taxpayer money i was for wasting taxpayer money to validate these signatures and the existence of that butterfly so i was for wasting taxpayer money before i was against it
7840251 were advising returnees through the local media to watch out for unexploded ordnance and to stay away from villages not yet cleared of mines and declared safe by the authorities
7840252 when is simple old me ever going to wear something so elegant
7840253 its a darn scarf i am never going to wear a scarf why couldnt she bring me some wine

7840257 you have some positive things going on the dollar strengthening is putting pressure on crude oil and thats helping some underlying support to the market after yesterdays sharp sell off
7840258 clearly the new home sales important for the economic outlook consumer confidence could also be key if we can see some better than expected numbers here maybe we can build on the gains spurred by the weaker oil price

7840266 heres a guy who was very quick on the political trigger by joining bloombergs coalition of gun grabbing municipal chief executives
7840267 but he really misfired when he violated his bond agreement and crossed the border into canada last month without telling the court in advance the behavior that got him into this legal quagmire suggests that kilpatrick considers himself above the law
7840268 new yorks mayor is lucky hes not facing charges for that vigilante gun shop sting operation he mounted two years ago because it interfered with legitimate federal investigations did kilpatrick think that he would also avoid trouble even though he lied under oath about a relationship he had with his former chief of staff
7840269 is hardly the face id want representing any group of mayors if i were michael bloomberg
7840270 mayors against illegal guns has been campaigning against a constitutionally protected fundamental civil right under the guise of crime control
7840271 claiming some kind of moral high ground in the process yet one of their key members is now under indictment for perjury misconduct and obstruction of justice and hes been jailed for violating provisions of his bond agreement
7840272 ive waited 66 years to see this come to illinois
7840273 if an assailant is bent on picking out a victim and the victim happens to be permitted to carry a concealed weapon and introduces it early enough it prevents a crime without a bullet being fired
7840274 and motor vehicles kill more people in a single year than handguns
7840275 and there are liability issues and many of these same issues will arise if legislation is enacted for concealed carry
7840276 good people make bad choices and the first time it happens and im telling you it will the law will be under scrutiny this is the ground level of something that will be talked about and scrutinized for years to come
7840277 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
7840278 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
7840279 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
7840280 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
7840281 you might like to have a gun in your car because you come home on an 11 30 p m flight
7840282 my goal was to grab onto his wrists and hold on

7840286 dont vote for my husband because im fawning over him and singing his praises vote for him because im a strong and a smart woman who didnt hitch her wagon to an idiot wholl waste my time and yours by betraying our dreams and trust hes going to accomplish real change because ive linked my life to his and had children with him and put aside my career for him and i wasnt raised to give my life up for just any fool

7840314 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7840315 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7840316 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7840317 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7840327 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7840328 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

7840391 while walking along a beach an elderly gentleman saw someone in the distance leaning down picking something up and throwing it into the ocean
7840392 good morning may i ask what it is that you are doing
7840393 i must ask then why are you throwing starfish into the ocean

7840400 ungeachtet des umstandes dass der bildungsmonitor 2008 eine positive entwicklung in unserem land konstatiert hinterfragen wir die wissenschaftliche wertigkeit dieser j hrlich vorgelegten studie
7840401 die aussagekraft von schlicht addierten statistischen daten und platzziffern als gradmesser f r die bildungsqualit t eines landes ist mehr als fragw rdig

7840409 in northern europe fairy lore fairies value blond hair in humans blond babies are more likely to be stolen and replaced with changelings and young blonde women are more likely to be lured away to the land of the fairies
7840410 some research suggests that fair hair being characteristic of young babies evokes parent like feelings of affection and protection in others
7840411 two notable sex icons of twentieth century america who helped popularize the blond image were jean harlow and marilyn monroe

7840413 we are gathered here in denver for a very clear and simple purpose
7840414 and that is to come out of this convention energized and excited and ready to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
7840415 we were not all on the same side as democrats
7840416 but we are now we are united and we are together and we are determined
7840417 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions

7840420 giving back 400 acres is dropping the project i cannot afford to do that
7840421 we will start a state wide agitation now against the project unless the land is returned to the farmers
7840422 i am trying my best i still believe i can convince the opposition i believe we should reach a consensus
7840423 i hope the car will come out of the plant in october
7840424 axon is a global leader in its field we believe there is room for a counter bid closer to 700 pence a share
7840425 we regard morse as the most likely company to benefit from the read through from the axon bid with its diagonal sap consultancy being the most obvious attraction

7840437 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
7840438 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
7840439 i spent the whole summer working on my fitness my strength and my game and took that into pre season so i felt ready to play
7840440 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance
7840441 now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
7840442 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player even so i didnt feel as though i was at my total best against west ham

7840446 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
7840447 as a result the elite end of the sport in this country was in a terrible state
7840448 you could argue that the head coachs job is to win the world cup we want martin johnson to win the next world cup so does he
7840449 but if as head coach you divorce yourself from the rest of the business structure which is what happened before and after the 2003 world cup you leave a massive void
7840450 english rugby was like a giant oil tanker going in the wrong direction and beginning to leak i said at my interview that it could take three years to stop the leakage and turn the ship round
7840451 i make no apology for being completely ruthless in my approach over the last two three four years we have witnessed some england performances which were not what you would expect from a group of players representing the biggest union in the world
7840452 english rugby has had its moments of true glory but for consistent results new zealand are always there year in year out we should be there with them
7840453 it would be nonsense to say three years out from the next world cup that we are going to win it but we have the high quality players coming through to know that we will at least go close

7840529 energy storage and powers caes technology is poised to become an important part of the dispatch stack that can address the intermittency of renewables and reduce on peak power costs
7840530 our company examined the technology for its own use and decided that the potential was great enough that we wanted a larger role in helping to make compressed air energy storage a technology that is broadly embraced by the electricity sector we believe this technology is an important component of a broad effort to combat climate change an effort that must include increased conservation expanded renewable energy and new clean central power
7840531 pseg has the expertise and financial resources to bring this technology out of the development stage and into the deployment stage we have learned a lot since building the mcintosh plant in alabama and i believe the time is right technically environmentally and economically for a large scale deployment of es amp ps caes technology
7840532 the technology has evolved to the point where it can be critical to helping this nation meet its growing energy needs while helping decrease carbon emissions from the electricity sector
7840533 we see strong market potential for caes in the traditional power industry as well as for the growing renewable energy industry
7840534 energy storage is the missing piece of the puzzle for a green affordable and reliable electric grid for the 21st century caes units can manage wind output to create a highly valuable firm dispatchable product even independent of wind it can be a cost effective intermediate generation source for energy arbitrage capacity and ancillary services i am very excited to launch this initiative with dr nakhamkin and look forward to working with him as we grow this business
7840535 clearly compressed air energy storage has significant potential as a near term viable large scale energy storage technology
7840536 as we see greater and more widespread integration of intermittent generation such as wind gain acceptance storage technologies like caes will become even more vital we look forward to working with pseg and other industry players in helping to accelerate the development and deployment of caes plant technology with both above ground and underground reservoirs for the storage of compressed air as an essential next step in advancing a cleaner and more environmentally sound energy future

7840547 our disappointing earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were primarily the result of lower than anticipated sales and the higher merchandise markdowns required to drive sales and lower the chicos brand inventory levels closer to current sales trends accordingly we achieved a 13 per square foot reduction for the chicos brand as we transitioned from the spring merchandising season to the fall merchandising season
7840548 the retail environment continues to be challenging as customers remain increasingly cautious in their spending across the entire retail sector especially in the missy category while we anticipate consolidated comparable store sales for the fall season to remain negative we expect to see an improvement in trend and continue to believe we will be profitable in the second half
7840549 although our second quarter results are disappointing we are encouraged by our initial reads on our fall offerings also we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet with cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 278 million and no debt further we remain focused on reducing expenses and managing lower inventory levels without affecting our ability to serve our customers we are also limiting capital expenditures to those that are necessary to sustain the business while targeting an acceptable return on where we choose to invest

7840595 but mistakes happen when youre doing substitutions then the kitchen has to remake it then if we do the substitution and then they dont like it weve got to make them something else
7840596 we serve a lot of people every day if every person made a special request it would be too difficult
7840597 then you get into the issue of what is the difference between a right substitution and a wrong substitution
7840598 we try to nip this in the bud by including information on the menu seafood pasta is not served with parmigiano because the cheese will destroy the delicate taste of the fish
7840599 a lot of other restaurants do what the customer wants
7840600 theyre jeopardizing their whole menu to give the customer what they want but what youre cooking its your heritage we started off small and now that weve grown the new customers dont understand what were doing
7840601 these recipes are traditional its how i was taught to cook i used to make the pizza i worked 10 years in the kitchen when we first opened even if you put another guy on the line substitutions can throw off the whole kitchen
7840602 we never had butter from day one we might have butter in the pastry kitchen but we dont cook with butter its not traditional weve always used olive oil which is better for you

7840656 we played some excellent football its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7840657 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7840658 as the us refused to carry out the agreement a grave obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula has been created
7840659 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7840660 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it did in iraq as it pleased
7840661 when the six party talks have degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7840662 verification is a duty to be carried out by every party that should come at the last stage of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7840663 has been pressing us to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please
7840664 in breach of our sovereignty and which subsequently caused us to leave the nuclear non proliferation treaty
7840665 the us is making a robber like demand that it will carry out unilateral inspections of us
7840666 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7840667 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7840668 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7840669 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7840670 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7840671 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges

7840694 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7840695 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7840696 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7840697 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7840698 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7840699 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7840700 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7840701 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7840702 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7840703 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7840704 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7840705 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7840706 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7840707 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7840708 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7840709 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7840714 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7840715 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7840716 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7840717 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7840718 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7840719 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7840720 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7840721 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7840722 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7840723 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7840724 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7840725 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7840726 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7840727 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7840728 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7840729 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7840730 our country we believe is the greatest county in the world and its given us so many great opportunities and its just this sense of pride that you have that you say you know what our country is the best
7840731 is it still cool to talk about fighting for the red white and blue

7840733 in perioada 1 mai 1 iunie 2008 a crescut notabil numarul turistilor sositi pe litoral trend ce va fi urmat si in septembrie astfel estimam ca vom inregistra o crestere a numarului de turisti la capete de sezon cu 25 30 fata de anul trecut
7840734 comparativ cu anii trecuti in 2008 mult mai multe hoteluri de pe litoral isi vor inchide usile la 1 octombrie in conditiile in care pana acum o faceau la 15 septembrie sau pana la data aceea
7840735 in aceste conditii ar fi necesar ca autoritatile locale sa oblige agentii economici sa isi inceapa activitatea de la startul oficial al sezonului si sa si incheie activitatea odata cu hotelurile
7840736 der gesundheitsfonds muss nachgebessert werden da f hrt kein weg dran vorbei wir haben entdeckt dass zurzeit schwammige angaben zu diagnosen m glich sind nach den derzeitigen richtlinien ist dies auch rechtlich machbar und den rzten ist hier berhaupt kein vorwurf zu machen
7840737 aber das kostet alle kassen im n chsten jahr unter morbi rsa gesichtspunkten echtes geld denn dieser sieht eine zuteilung an finanzmitteln nur f r bestimmte und eindeutig benannte erkrankungsbilder vor die aktuelle lage zeigt aber dass wir unter den derzeitigen umst nden keinen cent aus dem rsa topf sehen w rden

7840754 youre talking about people who have trained for years almost every day and made huge sacrifices in their relationships career all of it said charlie brown a sports psychologist and for some of them once they have this huge intense experience its a very fragile situation afterwards psychologists have conducted a string of studies of olympians transition to working life researchers found that only 17 percent made the transition to the workplace without significant emotional distress including substance abuse and depression
7840755 one of the great things about being forced to go to church services is that wed sing all these big songs thats partly why im obsessed with getting everyone to sing along at our shows it makes me feel like im a part of something
7840756 as to the question when human life begins the answer to which is above mr obamas pay grade oh lets go on a little tear you know why they call it birth control because its meant to stop a birth from happening nine months later we know when life begins everyone who ever bought a pack of condoms knows when life begins
7840757 many scientists and philosophers are convinced that free will doesnt exist at all should we worry if people come to believe that they dont have free will what will the consequences be for moral responsibility
7840758 those first days of a new school year i looked forward to wearing my new school outfit meeting new friends and new teachers but the most meaningful and surely the most memorable moments were when i hurried to the breakfast table to see what my father had written to me that morning i keep these letters in a special binder and read them every year about this time have since passed this tradition on to my own children the words are different as i have all boys but the love pride and well wishes for the coming year are the same tonight i have placed three letters by three cereal bowls at our breakfast table

7840789 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7840790 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7840791 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again

7840804 i pulled myself up by my own bootstraps and so can they
7840805 this was exemplified to me a few months ago while in a store
7840806 excuse me he wants to be homeless no one wants to be homeless even though it may appear that way we need to look at experiences such as physical abuse and emotional trauma the man may have encountered that have resulted in his long term homelessness
7840807 while wed like to think that a meal a few bible verses and a place to stay can provide a quick fix for the issue of poverty and homelessness for the most part its not as easy as that
7840808 over the years ive seen much material which attributes homelessness almost purely to a lack of affordable housing while that may be the issue in some cases it is far from universally true
7840809 all well do is take people with seriously debilitating issues
7840810 and give them a place to stay without dealing with the problems that caused their homelessness in the first place
7840811 it is found in a jesus based position and a realization that the lord has called us to be the visible representation of his love here on earth our culture is changed one heart at a time not with the changing of presidents and political parties
7840812 more specifically the solution for our nations burgeoning homeless population is for the homeless to have all of the help and professional services they need but cemented together by a relationship with jesus he is the only one who can give us the ability to successfully face life and navigate the myriad of problems and hurts which we all experience every day

7840839 i am really thrilled with how the 2009 youth kit turned out
7840840 it was a privilege to work with david nasser marcus goodloe and sean mcdowell we tried some new and innovative things that i believe will make a significant impact in the lives of students who are trying to make their faith an integral part of their life
7840841 there was no indication on the ground that there was such an alliance but i am puzzled by the mysterious silence of the npa on the atrocities committed by the milf
7840842 i think a statement from the npa that they do not agree with the massacre of the civilians and the killings of children would help greatly in reassuring us that they are not in cahoots with this milf criminal elements
7840843 four people are dead alright and we are investigating this attack
7840844 but they kept silent for on the way they had argued with dialegomai one another about who was the greatest
7840845 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7840846 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7840847 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7840848 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7840849 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7840850 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7840851 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7840852 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7840853 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7840854 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7840855 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7840856 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7840857 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7840858 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7840859 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7840860 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7840861 who are open to doing something on the production side
7840862 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7840863 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7840864 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7840865 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7840866 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7840867 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7840868 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7840869 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7840870 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7840871 and god i really think they needed to meet me as much as i needed to meet them
7840872 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7840873 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7840874 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7840875 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7840876 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7840877 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7840878 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7840879 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7840880 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7840881 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7840882 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7840883 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7840884 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7840885 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7840886 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7840887 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7840888 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7840889 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7840890 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7840891 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7840930 the tragic shooting of the toddler highlights once again the terrible consequences of the boys toys culture surrounding airgun ownership
7840931 this culture results in easy access casual regard and non accountability because airguns are not treated as real weapons they are not thought worthy of registration or regulation
7840932 they are not taken seriously the adults who own these guns are rarely held to account there is no law requiring them to store their weapons safely nor is there any record of ownership
7840933 the government cannot hide behind recent changes in legislation which failed to take the airgun problem seriously enough and make owners responsible for storing their weapons safely
7840934 airguns and their owners could be registered and they should be

7840955 these statements are far from the truth in fact agriculture in punjab has grown manifold the government has been helpful and the farmers enterprising every year the agricultural output is increasing of late we have been diversifying agriculture growing vegetables and other crops

7840987 in short i think we agree for the most part alan but saying the nt church did not do it is for me a thin argument
7840988 i cannot find an example in scripture of one believer being covenanted with another believer every christian is in covenant with god and because of the new covenant we have responsibilities some of which describe how we should relate to other believers
7840989 yet in scripture being covenanted with another believer is never even mentioned

7841046 when we updated our website and our online channel platforms last year as part of the process of making dubai bank a fully ethical and institution it became clear that we needed to increase the levels of security we offered our clients to protect both them and ourselves from the risks and threats associated with password and id theft we spent much time researching the possibilities and decided to deploy a two factor authentication solution to our corporate customers as a first step
7841047 having made the decision to use 2fa we conducted an extensive review of all the solutions on the market looking at the price performance product quality and security aspects of the market leaders in the end the cryptocard solution proved to be the logical choice for us
7841048 we found the cryptocard 2fa system to be the most flexible and suited to our purpose
7841049 rapid integration with our microsoft based infrastructure and our existing banking applications and the ability to scale right up to a million users were also key factors in our decision
7841050 we are really pleased to be working with dubai bank to secure access to their on line banking systems it is yet another example of how important the internet is to trading and how 2fa reduces the risks for both the bank and its customers
7841051 not only does this relationship increase our footprint in the middle east but it once again proves that our flexibility and the quality of our product provide the best solution for banks looking for the highest levels of security and best possible total cost of ownership

7841083 which one of your great grandchildren do you want to give this to
7841084 she feels that what was the happiest day of her life has been tarnished and doesnt understand how after everything she has done for them
7841085 but quite frankly she is also a little bewildered by all of this and was totally unaware about the extent of their grievances liz feels she made every effort to be a part of their extended family and fit in
7841086 she doesnt think that they have taken into consideration how much planning went into the wedding celebrations she was under a lot of pressure and was very very stressed and perhaps they misinterpreted this for rudeness
7841087 now liz has even offered to reimburse the nayars if they feel theyre out of pocket and hopes that this will be the end of the matter
7841088 yet as far as she is concerned that is it she never wants to see aruns father or step mother again
7841089 i think this elaborate indian event was elizabeths theatrical dream it was certainly not a serious attempt to honour our customs
7841090 in the end it was just nonsense the magazine wanted a great show so they could justify the big fee they were charged i think it was blatant and cynical commercialism
7841091 i once thought liz was a lovely unspoiled woman but now i see that she is a very hard person
7841092 it was important for her to get celebrity faces there thats what the hello deal was about she was fulfilling her contractual obligation
7841093 i never realised how desperate she is for fame and attention my wife and i were publicly humiliated and treated like social outcasts for the sake of a 2 million magazine deal
7841094 when i am forced to go to india i wear a face mask when i shower and i roll around naked on sheets fashioned of boots anti bacterial wipes its heavenly
7841095 liz and arun have treated us very shabbily my heart is heavy with pain
7841096 we were pushed into the background like poor relations this has broken my heart
7841097 i have decided to cut all ties with my sons i feel that liz and arun behaved shamefully and placed more importance on showing off than their own family
7841098 you have shown disrespect to me and my family plus my dear friends who have been with me since your birth

7841115 i feel like its a must win series i dont necessarily feel like we have to sweep them but i feel like we have to win the series

7841180 actually akala ko nga next month pa pero biglang lumabas na nga raw like sa yes magazine september 2008 issue pero yung tvc yata hindi pa i think isa yun sa dapat na abangan nila kasi maganda yung concept ng commercial we have to look for the next ponds girl were in search for two women and ide date namin sila
7841181 yung mga ganoong incident pero ngayon lang talaga kami nagkasama for one project
7841182 maganda nga ngayon kasi nagkakaroon ng fusion ng two different networks much more that he piolo has already established his name his career his personality so noong sinabi nila sa akin na ill be working with him para sa akin isang magandang opportunity siya so without hesitation talaga i was excited about the project
7841183 well it is on the producers perception yun ang tingin ng mga kliyente dahil siguro nakikita nilang swak kami doon sa hinahanap nilang image ng produkto siyempre ayaw ko rin namang sabihin on top or hottest siguro its just good to say that we just fit doon sa hinahanap nilang qualities
7841184 siyempre kapag nasa set kami ng dyesebel ikinukuwento niya direk joyce sa amin si piolo alam nyo yung immediately meron na kaming common tao na kilala na parehong malapit sa amin although mas malapit talaga siya piolo kay direk joyce dahil best friend sila
7841185 thank you po sa lahat ng bumati after nilang mapanood yung mmk episode na iyon nag text din po sina ms linggit tan mama bear at iba pa po at sinabi nilang magaling ang pagkakaganap ko and im happy sa mga papuri nila
7841186 sa totoo lang po halos manhid na ang buo kong katawan dahil sa pagod noong taping paano tatlong oras lang ako nakatulog sa sasakyan patungo sa mga taping ng dalawang tv program ko
7841187 feeling ko talaga tuyung tuyo na ako halos hindi na ako makaiyak dahil sa pagod e kaya nga para makaiyak lang ako ng maayos sinuntok ko yung cart ng popcorn talagang nasaktan ako at dumugo ang kamay ko nang makita yun ni direk jeffrey jeturian nasabi niya o take na
7841188 yung tatlong take nga po ng sampal sa akin ni tita dexter doria halos hindi ko nararamdaman dahil sa manhid na ang katawan ko kaya natuwa sa akin yung staff ng
7841189 kaya hindi ko talaga makakalimutan iyong cake dahil first time na nabigyan ako ng cake na hindi ko naman birthday e
7841190 maganda raw po ang acting ko pasado raw sa panlasa niya although nahihiya ako kaya inililipat lipat ko yung tv dahil baka kulang pa yung acting ko e at saka yung role ko kasi gro medyo daring kaya nahihiya ako kay dennis
7841191 siya po ang nauna palagi nga po siyang may interview linggu linggo sa tv pati sa dyaryo kaya huwag po siyang mag comment na ako ang nauna pakiusap lang tantanan na niya ako kung iyon ang gusto niyang mangyari talaga
7841192 mabuti nga at hindi na ito sinabi pa ni cristine sa publiko ayaw na kasi niyang palakihin pa ang insidente si carlene lang naman kasi ang gustung gustong maki ride on sa publicity kina dennis at cristine e
7841193 sa tigin po ba ninyo iboboto ko siya sa tingin nyo lang po kasi sa tingin ko ano e joke lang po ha ha ha ha
7841194 hindi naman siguro ako dapat maapektuhan doon e so okey lang sa ibang party na lang ako pupunta ha ha ha ha
7841195 ewan ko ba bahala na lang siyang magsalita ng kung anu ano riyan hindi ako apektado sa kanya basta sa amin ni dennis walang problema at ayoko namang magmakapal ng mukha na pupunta roon kung may mga taong ayaw akong papuntahin
7841196 he is believed to have been snatching bags for four to five years our investigators had been calling him the chameleon as he changed clothes or wore camouflage outfits to merge into the background
7841197 by the time we radioed in that the culprit was wearing black clothes he was wearing white or red
7841198 personally i believe in karma kaya nga you have to be careful sa kahit ano ang gagawin mo sa mga tao because youll never know when karma will hit you hindi ko alam kung karma nga yun pero kung karma nga yun e di karma but yun pa rin yun e he needed that to realize things and learn
7841199 alam mo naniniwala ako na kung anuman ang dinadaanan o pinagdadaanan ng isang tao its for him just like ive said he needed that its a humbling experience and its a reality check hindi ko sinasabi na he deserves it but he needed that to realize a lot of things
7841200 different forms different problems pero same emotions kung anuman ang pinagdaanan niya maybe patas ng pinagdaanan ko god kasi he just moves in different ways he shows himself in different ways different situations it doesnt mean problem its just an obstacle that you really have to go through he bernard needed that to become who he is right now im sure his family is proud of him
7841201 kung nagtatrabaho man siyang mabuti ngayon dapat lang naman because parents should do that for their kids i think thats the rightful thing to do on both our sides because kung anuman ang pinagdanan mo sa past sa parents mo sa life mo dapat hindi ganun ang ibibigay natin sa anak natin
7841202 sa ngayon hindi pa siya nagbibigay ng financial support but you know he gives mga diapers milk supplies and it helps yung support financially kasi i dont ask and i will never ask
7841203 mababait sila mahal na mahal ko yung family ni bernard sincerely dumadalaw kami you really have to put aside para sa anak ko
7841204 talaga hindi ko alam ang tungkol diyan but thats good sana siya na lang ang mag file

7841218 what can i say we are so glad to be here we are so happy to be here to be able to stand with you against the occupation we have longed for so many many months to arrive and now its like a dream for us to meet you
7841219 better it could be a boy than to suffer like me
7841220 i hate girls if this is the condition in such intellectual group then what to think others
7841221 anzam gulishtan karne ke jab ek hin ullu kafi tha anzam gulishtan kya hoga jab har shakh pe ullu baitha hai
7841222 you write something about terrorism and the next thing you know your name is on a list and from there to guantanamo bay its just a short trip the good news is that you will be wearing an orange jumpsuit
7841223 i have looked into the scriptures of all the religions i have looked into the ideological literature of all the political parties and i am amazed they go on piling up lies upon lies and the whole of humanity is asleep not only does nobody object but nobody even suspects
7841224 our war on terror begins with al qaeda but it does not end there it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated
7841225 now the world war has become almost impossible otherwise there would have been no terrorism enough time has passed since the second world war the third world war should have happened near about 1960 it has not happened this has been the routine for the whole of history and man is programmed for it terrorism is going to become bigger and bigger because the third world war is almost impossible and the stupid politicians have no other alternative terrorism simply means that what was being done on a social scale now has to be done individually it will grow it can only be prevented if we change the very base of human understanding which is a himalayan task more so because these same people whom you want to change will fight you they wont allow you to change them easily
7841226 you cant be free unless absolutely whatsoever happens spontaneously in you is allowed and accepted man has been programmed you have been given blueprints what to be how to be what is acceptable and what is not acceptable and those programs have been put so deep down in your being that you have become unconscious of them it appears as if you are acting out of freedom you have been tremendously deceived even when you think you are acting out of freedom even when you think you are acting out of your own conscience you are not the society is controlling you in a very subtle way the moment the child is born the society starts programming the child the society treats you like a computer it goes on feeding and programming you by the time you become a little alert you are already programmed you are already a christian or a hindu or a jain you are already fixed you are no more liquid you are no more flowing and you will function out of this fixity out of this obsession that the society has put inside you it is like an electrode put inside your brain you will not know anything about it but it will control you thats what conscience is
7841227 thats why i go on destroying your conditionings my whole effort is to deprogram you and make you clean as clean as pure as innocent as you were when you were born you were not born a christian you were not born jewish you were born just an innocent potentiality of growth which has been stopped by the vested interests and those vested interests are still in power they are doing their best to destroy any possibility for human evolution my people have to fight for their own sake and for the sake of humanity first become enlightened and then spread your light to anybody who is interested everybody is interested who would not like to become more conscious more alive more loving more compassionate just models are needed people are needed who can create a tremendous urge in others that they can also have the same joy the same dance the same song and the same fragrance the politicians and the priests are still not on their deathbed we will have to put them on their deathbed they will resist but what to do either they have to become part of an evolutionary process or they have to disappear from the earth
7841228 without freedom you cannot rejoice you live in fear not in joy if we can clean the basement of the human minds unconscious and thats what my work is it can be cleaned away the terrorism is not in the bombs in your hands the terrorism is in your unconscious otherwise this state of affairs is going to grow more bitter and it seems all kinds of blind people have bombs in their hands and are throwing them at random the third world war would have relieved people for ten or fifteen years but the third world war cannot happen because if it happens it wont relieve people it will only destroy people so individual violence will increase it is increasing and all your governments and all your religions will go on perpetuating the old strategies without understanding the new situation the new situation is that every human being needs to go through therapies needs to understand his unconscious intentions needs to go through meditations so that he can calm down become cool and look towards the world with a new perspective of silence
7841229 terrorism is not in the bombs in your hand terrorism is in your unconscious
7841230 what happens with your sex energy depends on how you use it what it can become does not depend on it alone but on your understanding and on how you live your life have you not observed that it becomes brahmacharya the state of celibacy when it is transformed bramhacharya is not hostile to passion brahmacharya is the purification the transcendence the sublimation of passion in the same way the energy that manifests itself in violence becomes peace serenity and tranquility it is only a question of transformation the energy that manifests itself in violence becomes peace serenity and tranquility it is only a question of transformation
7841231 as you become more and more meditative your energies become non aggressive your violence disappears love arises
7841232 everything is deeply related with everything else that happens the event of terrorism is certainly related with what is happening in the society the society is falling apart its old order discipline morality religion everything has been found to be wrongly based it has lost its power over peoples conscience
7841233 terrorism simply symbolizes that to destroy human beings does not matter that there is nothing in human beings which is indestructible that it is all matter and you cannot kill matter you can only change its form once man is taken to be only a combination of matter and no place is given for a spiritual being inside him then to kill becomes just play
7841234 and all those terrorists are coming from these poor countries with the same weapons that have been sold to their countries and they have a strange protection you cannot use nuclear weapons against them you cannot throw atom bombs at them they can throw bombs at you and you are suddenly impotent
7841235 man accumulates so much anger so much rage so much violence that nothing short of a war will give him release so war after war there is a gap of only ten to fifteen years that gap is a kind of relaxation but again you start accumulating because the same psychology is working the same jealousy the same violence
7841236 every man is living in a disagreement with himself so whenever he can find a chance for a beautiful cause freedom democracy socialism any beautiful word can become an umbrella to hide his ugly unconscious which simply wants to destroy and enjoys destruction now the world war has become almost impossible otherwise there would have been no terrorism
7841237 slow down be in the moment and dont get too far ahead of yourself
7841238 and you cannot condemn the man for killing a stranger because he is not a thief he did not take anything from him he is not an enemy he did not even see who was the man he was killing he was simply bored with life and he wanted to do something that made him feel significant important he is happy that all the newspapers have his photo if they had published his photo before he would not have killed but they waited until he kills they will not publish his photo and he wanted to be a celebrity just ordinary human desires and he was ready to pay with his life to become at least for one day known to the whole world recognized by everybody until we change the basic grounds of humanity terrorism is going to become more and more a normal everyday affair it will happen in the airplanes it will happen in the buses it will start happening in the cars it will start happening to strangers somebody will suddenly come and shoot you not that you have done anything to him but just the hunter is back the hunter was satisfied in the war now the war has stopped and perhaps there is no possibility for it the hunter is back now we cannot fight collectively each individual has to do something to release his own steam
7841239 my understanding is that the way he has lived man needs every ten to twelve years a war he accumulates so much anger so much rage so much violence that nothing short of a war will give him release so war after war there is a gap of only ten to fifteen years that gap is a kind of relaxation but again you start accumulating because the same psychology is working the same jealousy the same violence and man is basically a hunter he is not by nature vegetarian first he became a hunter and for thousands of years he was just a meat eater and cannibalism was prevalent everywhere to eat human beings caught from the opposing tribe you were fighting with was perfectly ethical all that is carried in the unconscious of humanity religions have imposed things on man very superficially his unconscious is not in agreement every man is living in a disagreement with himself so whenever he can find a chance for a beautiful cause freedom democracy socialism any beautiful word can become an umbrella to hide his ugly unconscious which simply wants to destroy and enjoys destruction it can only be prevented if we change the very base of human understanding which is a himalayan task because these same people whom you want to change will fight you they whod allow you to change them easily in fact they love bloodshed they dont have the courage to say so
7841240 governments are to save people from terrorism are here governments are supplying money and arms and food to terrorists
7841241 one has to understand that everything is relative not ultimate hence what appears to be good to one person may look evil to another and there is no contradiction both may be right what is good depends on your preconceived ideas so does evil the british government thinks my entry even for an overnight stay in england is not conducive to the public good the same government is ready to allow american bombers missiles to use their bases to destroy a small country like libya and to the government this seems to be conducive to public good there is no inconsistency in their eyes their society their culture their religion their country has to be saved at any cost because they think they stand for good although the british government has tortured humanity more than any other government in the world for three hundred years it has been the greatest terrorist possible it killed millions of people around the world to create the greatest empire of history this government is absolutely in tune with the american imperialistic ideology out of necessity it has been compelled to give freedom to the countries of its empire but not willingly and joyously those countries had to fight for almost one century without any arms they were butchered without any consideration of human values
7841242 adolf hitler writes in his autobiography that unless you create hostility amongst your neighbor nations you can never become strong keep always people afraid that the enemy is going soon soon you will be destroyed that fear will keep them strong and ready to order and surrender and trust and believe anything the leader says
7841243 in the east particularly death is respected more than life and the east has lived long to come to this conclusion in the west life is more respected than death hence so much tension so much worry and so much anguish so much madness why if you respect life more you will be afraid of death and then death will look antagonistic the enemy and if death is the enemy you will remain tense your whole life because death can happen any moment you dont accept it you reject it but you cannot destroy it death cannot be destroyed you can reject it you can deny it you can be afraid scared but it is there just at the corner always with you like a shadow you will be trembling your whole life and you are trembling and in the fear in all fears if searched deeply you will find the fear of death whenever you are afraid something has given you an indication of death if your bank goes bankrupt and you are filled with fear and trembling anxiety that too is anxiety about death because your bank balance was nothing but a security against death now you are more open vulnerable now who will protect you if death knocks at the door if you become ill if you become old then who is going to take care of you the guarantee was there in the bank and the bank has gone bankrupt you cling to prestige power position because when you have a position you are so significant that you are more protected by people when you are not in power you become so impotent that nobody bothers in any way who you are when you are in power you have friends family followers when you are not in power everybody leaves there was a protection somebody was there to care now nobody cares whatsoever you are afraid of if you search deeply you will always find the shadow of death somewhere you cling to a husband you are afraid he may leave or you cling to a wife afraid she may leave you what is the fear is it really the fear of a divorce or is it a fear of death it is a fear of death because in divorce you become alone the other gives a protection a feeling that you are not alone somebody else is with you in moments when somebody else will be needed you will have somebody to look to but the wife has left or the husband has left and now you are left alone a stranger who will protect you who will care for you when you are ill

7841255 in the case of the constitutional court we have to add three to the number and submit that to the president out of which he will choose one
7841256 for that you need a larger number than in the case of the high court we didnt receive sufficient numbers
7841257 the article as you are reading it to me is not correct
7841258 what i was informed was that the list was insufficient
7841259 its not something im that happy about but its good to break it
7841260 it only really dawned on me at the end of the test thats why i had goosebumps for the last few minutes of the game when we realised that we had won it it was a special feeling
7841261 thats something we avoided talking about this time and i think it worked
7841262 we didnt mention once about how difficult it is to play here every other time ive come over here weve said how hard it is and that not many teams win here but this time we just focused on our own preparation now we are already discussing winning two in a row here well move straight on to that task this week

7841265 it was a tough call to make between derick chiliboy and bandise but derick is our first choice hooker and since he has recovered from his hamstring injury he is back in the starting xv with bandise on the bench
7841266 chiliboy will definitely stay in our system and he will be involved in our next match but he has identified a few aspects of his game that he would like to work on we all know he is not yet at his absolute best after his long lay off but he is prepared to put in the hard yards in order to maximise his full potential
7841267 pedrie has played at lock in the past and provides adequate back up for us we know we are a bit thin at lock but it will be a great test for our depth

7841272 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7841273 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really it was because no one bothered to follow him
7841274 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it

7841318 as i said in two eve of polling ceramahs last night there is no doubt of datuk seri anwar ibrahim being re elected as mp for permatang pauh and his return to parliament after an absence of a decade
7841319 on top of the visible presence of policemen at polling centres special action force and commando 69 personnel will be mobilised around the constituency
7841320 we are entering parliament with a clear agenda and they should wake up with the stark realities of the day

7841326 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class
7841327 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and its impact on small cars
7841328 lots of families are looking to make the switch to small cars and its noteworthy that the toyota corolla and toyota yaris two of the top smallest cars in our ranking and highly respected both carry rebates that demonstrates once again how important it is for buyers to do their homework you never know where the deals might be especially in this buyers market
7841329 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals lists for months
7841330 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year
7841331 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 dollars to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
7841332 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
7841333 i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
7841334 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
7841335 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market

7841343 i notice that there are a lot of people here
7841344 this is my second time of coming here i was here in the morning and was asked to come back in the evening now i am here
7841345 i think that because big brother africa is showing everybody wants to make sure that their systems have the programme
7841346 so people resorted to coming physically to the multichoice office i for one responded i for one sent my smart card twice and was not connected
7841347 unfortunately a lot people did not get the message or did not pay attention or respond until big brother africa started yesterday sunday
7841348 for some reasons nigerians dont do things on time and usually people leave their subscriptions dormant until there is a major event like the world cup champions leagues or even the premiership
7841349 i think that to solve this problem multichoice should open more outlets everyone in abuja coming to one office has become cumbersome
7841350 it has come to a point where parents have to ensure children below 18 do not watch the programme
7841351 the other challenge which i dont know how this is going to change things is viewing the programme in public places from what i understand public establishments are supposed to have different subscription from private places
7841352 but people dont always indicate whether they are using their decoders in public places
7841353 another thing is that people rushing to renew their subscriptions of course shows that people want to watch this programme not because they want to indulge in depravity and it does not mean that if a lot of people want to watch what is bad what is bad becomes the norm or the standard

7841355 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7841356 members of the agency are clearly on heightened alert based upon the security thats involved with a convention the size of the one that is occurring in denver behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
7841357 i cannot talk about the federal implications associated with this case
7841358 however the fact that we are able to draw a nexis between this suspect and these other parties were extremely happy
7841359 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7841392 whatever the record was it didnt matter i was biting at the bit every sunday it was killing me that i couldnt be there

7841394 of course between me and the other firemen playing ball all those years the bodys getting worn down but the heart is still ticking and ive still got that passion ive still got that burning desire
7841395 when a touchdown is scored thats obvious so many other times you have to pick and choose you dont want to tick people off during the game
7841396 and the defensive chants are the hardest to come by youve got to get people up from sitting on their butts its a homefield edge the players feed off that
7841397 watching brett favre that close he just zips the ball
7841398 other guys throw a pass that wont be that tight a spiral it happens but it seems like every single pass with him its a tight spiral if you wanted to teach a kid how to throw a ball that would be the guy to show him and take the gray hair away and that guy is awesome shape tremendous shape
7841399 but you know whats more refreshing than anything with favre im just amazed at his humbleness a guy with all those accolades at that level for so long a time to be as humble and grounded as he is we went from a guy like chad pennington who just represented the organization so well to another guy whos on the same level even a better more accomplished guy

7841423 der zugang zu sportst tten muss zudem unb rokratisch und kostenlos sein
7841424 die vp ist daf r verantwortlich dass der turnunterricht in den vergangenen jahren drastisch gek rzt worden ist jetzt scheinheilig gute ratschl ge zu geben ist verzichtbar vielmehr sollte bundesminister hahn sicherstellen dass der turnunterricht in schulen wieder forciert wird turnunterricht muss so gestaltet werden dass er auch sportlich wenig begabten kindern spa macht
7841425 die krausen inhaltlichen forderungen der volkspartei sollen offensichtlich durch die vereinnahmung des guten rufs der unabh ngigen richterschaft verschleiert werden

7841435 es hat sich seit jahren abgezeichnet dass viele kinder einen sprachf rderbedarf haben
7841436 der hohe anteil an f rderbedarf ist ein resultat der verfehlten wiener integrationspolitik
7841437 es ist uns daher wichtig dass alle kinder mit f rderbedarf auf einem vollwertigen kindergartenplatz optimal auf die schule vorbereitet werden
7841438 getto sprachkurse wie sie die stadt wien f r kinder die keinen kindergartenplatz haben anbietet werden einen ungen genden f rdererfolg bringen und daher lehnen wir sie ab
7841439 obwohl die ma nahmen der sprachfr hf rderung vor einem jahr beschlossen wurden hat die stadt wien zu wenig unternommen

7841452 during the credit crunch timeshare represents increasingly good holiday value and although many brits may be forced to cut back group rci members can rest assured that they have budgeted in advance for a well earned holiday in addition our members can choose breaks from a wide portfolio of holiday properties such as lakeside retreats in finland a spa hotel in the uk or perhaps a beach resort in florida

7841583 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7841584 a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7841585 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7841586 we dont want to let carlisle come here and beat us
7841587 its all about momentum and continuing to win games and hopefully we will do that
7841588 but im really enjoying playing in the middle hopefully i can now start adding some goals its about time because ive only scored about a dozen in my career so far
7841589 the expectation is that qpr will turn us over with the millionaire squad theyve got
7841590 they will be a very good side but it might be a good time to catch them at the start of the season when they might not have fully gelled together
7841591 we can just go there and enjoy ourselves and if we get something out of it thats brilliant we can use it as a test for where we are as a squad these are the teams we want to be playing thats the league the team and the fans want to be in
7841592 we will probably have our backs to the wall at times in the game but its going to be a good challenge its something the lads should be looking forward to and relishing
7841593 i dont think qpr will go thinking its a stroll in the park there is a giant killing aspect with us being in a different league but we are probably closer to them than most people would give us credit for
7841594 i didnt have that much to do but what i did i was quite pleased with
7841595 i would have preferred a clean sheet last week at home but im happy with how things went and how the team played
7841596 i thought we defended really well particularly in the second half when it was backs to the wall
7841597 we werent as clinical with our chances as we have been in the previous games but as a defensive unit we can be happy with a clean sheet our second in four games
7841598 once you start getting to the last 15 20 minutes if you cant nick it the important thing is not to lose it
7841599 weve had a difficult start to the season with so many away games and to still be unbeaten gives us a great unity and something we can build on
7841600 people have to be a little bit patient its a new face and the goalkeeper is a big part of the defensive unit
7841601 for the defenders its a big change from having keiren for the last four years but we are getting better with every game were cutting out the mistakes and learning each others strengths and weaknesses
7841602 ive said before that moving clubs is a bit like changing schools
7841603 but im getting used to it the lads and the staff have been brilliant and having timmo goalkeeping coach dave timmins around is giving me the chance to improve every day and every game thats what i want
7841604 we think very highly of gary at the football club
7841605 he is learning from people like michael bridges and scott dobie who have been around seen it and done it
7841606 gary is getting better all the time and at some stage is going to force his way through that group he is not far away from doing that
7841607 im aware weve got to look after him but at the same time hes champing at the bit and telling me he wants to play
7841608 richard isnt far away but it might be too much for him getting a start
7841609 centre half is a big position he might be ok for half an hour but probably not to start
7841610 if some of the lads need a breather and others need an opportunity ill happily do that
7841611 but make no mistake i want to win this game im not treating the game lightly the guys who will come in are first team people i have said from day one that we will need the full squad this season and you will see evidence of that tonight
7841612 they had used the wrong name on the document so i insisted that they correct the name before they could take her away i reminded them that they had to bring her home within the stipulated 12 hours
7841613 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
7841614 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day
7841615 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process

7841619 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7841620 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7841621 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7841622 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7841623 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7841624 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7841625 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7841626 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7841627 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7841628 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7841629 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7841630 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7841631 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7841632 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7841633 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7841634 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7841635 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7841636 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7841637 the iraqi people the resistance and oil versus american bases
7841638 i couldnt believe it in front of me were reams of extremely confidential information about thousands and thousands of people
7841639 the oil price fall came in handy as funds and investors decided to cover short positions in the index futures and financial counters rather than roll them over

7841651 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7841652 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7841653 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7841654 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7841717 the fact is we have achieved an amazing success simply convening this meeting

7841724 its not all doom and gloom across the entire real estate sector
7841725 while certain segments within specific areas in south africa have experienced a fall in prices there is reason to believe that trading conditions will become bullish in the short term
7841726 the industry is going through what economists call a correction in the marketplace
7841727 this simply means that house pricing in the middle segment of the market in particular is far more realistic than 18 months ago
7841728 saptg data paints an accurate picture of what is happening nationally regionally and all the way down to street level
7841729 the lower economic end of the market is actually experiencing growth in both value and volume of sales similarly there has also been a healthy increase in the value of sales at the very top end of the market whilst this has been tempered by a decrease in volume in most areas
7841730 if we compare the first seven months of 2007 with the same period this year our data indicates that the suburb has experienced excellent growth
7841731 excluding transfers valued at r100 000 or below which may typically include rdp housing and deceased estates the volume of transfers is up from 517 last year to 548 this year
7841732 the data clearly shows that this large suburb hasnt been hit by the real estate recession
7841733 the johannesburg suburbs of sandown and bryanston epitomise the situation
7841734 sandown has seen average transfer values increase by 17 2 percent while the volume of sales has dropped by 28 percent similarly average values have increased by a vigorous 31 2 percent in bryanston even though the suburb has experienced a 10 5 percent drop in the volume of sales
7841735 one property in sandurst was bought for r17 25 million in 2005 and sold for r59 million just a few months ago
7841736 what is true is that there are areas in the country where prices have fallen by 30 to 40 percent and even more
7841737 but the fall in property value has been largely confined to the middle sector of the residential market
7841738 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban

7841742 there is a growing consensus in government that those who run websites and blogs should be held accountable and this means that laws should be used to take action against those who defame and spread disinformation
7841743 if not we are going to have a situation where everyone will be free to make all sorts of allegations with no downside at all there is a fear that the trust level with bn would be very low if nothing is done said a senior government official familiar with details of the meeting

7841761 for myself for my glory i endowed you with gifts and ennobled you with faculties and clothed you with powers second only to my own i sent you into the world to expend those gifts and to employ those faculties and to exert those powers for my glory and with a view to the enjoyment of me forever but you buried those gifts you abused those faculties you wasted those powers and you lived to yourself and not unto me and now to yourself and in everlasting banishment from my presence you shall continue to live through eternity

7841778 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7841779 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7841780 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7841781 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7841782 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7841783 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7841784 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7841785 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7841786 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7841787 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7841788 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7841789 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes

7841941 this the ndc finds difficult to accept hence their determination to result to tribal politics
7841942 you showed them in 2000 and 2004 that tribal politics has no room in modern day ghana and i know you will do the same this year too

7841952 2000 the we didnt have people like that to support us but the npp won the election so we are going to win the forthcoming december elections with or without them we are happy to see them in our party and we welcome them we know their presence in the party will help the party to get more votes but our campaign structure does not depend on them

7842050 na decis o de 1980 eu perdi a final com o internacional e assim foi bom eu ter a oportunidade de lutar novamente por esse t tulo que o mais importante da am rica do sul quanto oportunidade de entrar para a hist ria foi muito legal isso o t tulo corou um trabalho que foi lembrado tamb m porque foi no ano do centen rio
7842051 foi uma honra muito grande fazer parte deste t tulo t o importante para a hist ria de um clube que eu gosto muito n o f cil pois poucos treinadores conquistaram isso me deixa muito feliz um trof u que as pessoas n o v o esquecer assim como o sul americano de 48 que lembrado at hoje acredito que daqui a 50 anos as pessoas ir o falar
7842052 esse t tulo enriquece o curr culo e prova a compet ncia do treinador em rela o aos clubes esse com certeza foi o melhor grupo de trabalhei
7842053 esse time foi formado a longo prazo come ou em 1997 no ano da conquista do campeonato brasileiro por esse motivo era entrosado e tinha um senso coletivo muito grande

7842062 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy
7842063 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7842064 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7842065 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7842066 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7842067 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate
7842068 this was a very good tournament for us to participate in against some very good high class opposition in particular argentina
7842069 it was a good test and we found that we can compete with these teams to a certain level especially in terms of defence and organisation but we need to do more work on playing with the ball
7842070 this international experience will be of great benefit to us as we head towards the afc championships
7842071 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the u s dollar
7842072 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7842073 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
7842074 it would be easily understandable if someone became so annoyed at all these false notions that for the rest of his life he despised and mocked all talk about being but in this way he would be deprived of the truth of existence and would suffer a great loss
7842075 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
7842076 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
7842077 i spent the whole summer working on my fitness my strength and my game and took that into pre season so i felt ready to play
7842078 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance
7842079 now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
7842080 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player even so i didnt feel as though i was at my total best against west ham
7842081 ive been in the public eye for my entire life people know me from full house people know me as a fashion icon people know me as one of those twins my whole childhood is on full house and a lot of memories are on set growing up on television and with the media its easier to deal with because you grow up with it i was never thrown into the process which i can imagine would be very difficult
7842082 jen didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine

7842096 the chapels feel they have been rushed into this action by the fast pace at which these changes are being introduced
7842097 there is also anger at the unprofessional way staff were informed of this re application element of the package
7842098 we oppose any situation where someone is only given the chance to stay on with the company at a lower salary this is a situation likely to most hit loyal and long serving employees on modest salaries
7842099 we do not believe our readers will be best served by reduced numbers of journalists expected to take on extra work which will inevitably leave them less time for news gathering and investigation

7842107 waar het charisma van de geest ontbreekt dreigt het ambt te verworden tot een job een baantje
7842108 de ambten staan in het teken van de opbouw van de gemeente wat benzine voor een auto is zijn de ambten voor de gemeente maar de ambten zijn geen doel in zichzelf ambtsdragers zijn de pezen die verbinding leggen en aan het lichaam vastheid geven
7842109 de gereformeerde ambtstraditie heeft twee polemische spitsen gericht op de rooms katholieke hi rarchie en de ambtsopvatting van dopersen en vrije groepen calvijn negeert de gaven niet maar betrekt die sterk op de ambten de gaven gaan aan de ambten vooraf maken die mogelijk
7842110 prof dr c graafland heeft laten zien dat calvijn in vrijheid met de schriftgegevens omging uit de veelheid van teksten komen de herder de regering en de verzorging van de armen naar voren calvijn las de schrift in de context van zijn tijd en dat is een interessant gegeven moeten we ook vandaag niet letten op wat deze tijd nodig heeft
7842111 dat kan in elke tijd een eigen concretisering krijgen maar dat houdt niet in dat iedereen er het zijne uitkiest zoals in een supermarkt wat de schrift over structuur en orde leert is altijd betrokken op de doorwerking van het heil in christus in de opbouw van het geloof van de gemeente
7842112 de concentratie op het woord is bijbels toch vinden we de spilfunctie van de predikant niet terug in het nieuwe testament in de gereformeerde traditie is sprake van een zekere verruiming ten opzicht van het nieuwe testament tegelijk is er een zekere verenging ik denk aan de figuur van de profeet de evangelist
7842113 en hoe zit het met de gave van profetie is de sacramentsbediening alleen voorbehouden aan predikanten of zouden ze zich in deze tijd niet veel meer moeten beperken tot hun wezenlijke taak de woordverkondiging

7842117 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7842118 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7842119 we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin cut offs themselves as they are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where they are growing healthily again
7842120 its amazing how cost saving projects move to the front of the line when these companies come under commodity cost pressures

7842172 when the smoke clears now it appears we may start to shift to the central question of the meaning of marxist communism to what degree do we want to elect obama and give the radical left coalition a mandate for communism to proceed in the united states after millions of lives were given in the 20th century precisely to rid the world of it

7842174 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine

7842182 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7842183 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7842184 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children

7842216 the official artists do amuse the court of critics experts and social followers in a way they are more conservative and patronizing than the official artists of the late 19c take lichtenstein for example who was pushed to paint blown up versions of comic strips when in 1960 one of his sons pointed to a mickey mouse comic book ad said i bet you cant paint as good as that he painted an outsized picture of donald duck in 1962 he caused a sensation in the art world with his cartoon based show at the castelli gallery in new york in november 1963 lichtenstein said my work is different from comic strips but i wouldnt call it a transformation what i do is form whereas the comic strip is not formed in the sense im using the word the comics have shapes but there has been no effort to make them intensely unified 19 this may sound surprisingly pretentious from the mouth of the leading pop artist but lichtenstein after all for a good part of his life was a university professor of art on the other hand copying comic strips made him rich and famous this process had to turn however on one shared assumption that lichtenstein was an artist while the cartoonists were not

7842300 bank holiday weekends are always busy for us now but combined with people having their salaries paid going into the weekend makes it even busier
7842301 sunday night of a bank holiday weekend is always as busy as the friday and saturday nights
7842302 also bank holidays are often associated with an increase in domestic violence as well we see assaults and so forth increase

7842539 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7842540 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7842541 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this

7842553 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7842565 now is not the time to discuss the referees injuries absences
7842566 this is not the time to speak of officiating but i think with the fiba rules we would have won that is why we are a little annoyed because we were right there at the finish line and we have just missed out
7842567 the recommendations by the fiba technical commission and the decisions taken by the central board were strived by the attempt to further unify all existing game rules and
7842568 winning olympic gold in beijing depended partly on team usas ability to cope with the unfamiliar geometry of the international game a trapezoidal lane a shallow 3 point arc and a contorted array of driving lanes but in two years the trapezoid will be dead the arc will be a little deeper and the international game will be a bit closer in style to the n b a s
7842569 its also probably an endorsement of our game and our rules
7842570 that is not the way the fiba board who made the decision actually felt about it
7842571 the board felt thats no longer now an exceptional shot

7842997 at the beginning i could not tell what it was i had never seen anything like it before
7842998 so i decided to put my mask on and put my face over into the water
7842999 right after this i explained to my guests that it looked like a white whale shark and we were going to all jump in the water and try to follow it
7843000 i told everyone to keep a distance and not disturb it so we all jumped in the water and followed it for five minutes
7843001 i kept up swimming with it and i got very close even the eye was white

7843241 when we updated our website and our online channel platforms last year as part of the process of making dubai bank a fully ethical and institution it became clear that we needed to increase the levels of security we offered our clients to protect both them and ourselves from the risks and threats associated with password and id theft we spent much time researching the possibilities and decided to deploy a two factor authentication solution to our corporate customers as a first step
7843242 having made the decision to use 2fa we conducted an extensive review of all the solutions on the market looking at the price performance product quality and security aspects of the market leaders in the end the cryptocard solution proved to be the logical choice for us
7843243 we found the cryptocard 2fa system to be the most flexible and suited to our purpose
7843244 rapid integration with our microsoft based infrastructure and our existing banking applications and the ability to scale right up to a million users were also key factors in our decision
7843245 we are really pleased to be working with dubai bank to secure access to their on line banking systems it is yet another example of how important the internet is to trading and how 2fa reduces the risks for both the bank and its customers
7843246 not only does this relationship increase our footprint in the middle east but it once again proves that our flexibility and the quality of our product provide the best solution for banks looking for the highest levels of security and best possible total cost of ownership

7843713 am avut ocazia sa i vad stilul de conducere de aproape in septembrie 1999
7843714 i n cele 20 de minute de mers cu masina pana in oras m a chestionat cu privire la atitudinile romanilor despre statutul unor lideri guvernamentali si despre culisele politicii externe romanesti in privinta lui slobodan milosevici care se afla inca la putere in iugoslavia
7843715 isi aminteste rosapepe si face o observatie fiindca biden ii cunostea pe toti liderii marcanti inca dinaintea indepartarii dictatorului nicolae ceausescu in 1989 intrebarile lui au fost foarte dificile
7843716 intreba despre fiecare in parte din moment ce ii cunostea personal si pe acestia
7843717 in majoritatea intalnirilor liderii romani reiterau interesul lor profund pentru aderarea la nato la un dejun la mine acasa cu liderii partidelor de opozitie unul dintre ei a spus ca aderarea la nato este importanta pentru tara lor pentru un motiv pe care nu il mai auzisem inainte
7843718 acel domn a vorbit gresit si ca romanii aveau relatii bune cu minoritatea maghiara
7843719 si aveau dreptate cand partidul de opozitie a ajuns la putere un an mai tarziu partidul minoritatii maghiare a sustinut noul guvern in 2004 romania a aderat la nato cu sustinerea dlui biden
7843720 de ce este tipul asta atat de suparat arata asa cum ma simteam eu cand am prezidat pentru ultima data comisia juridica
7843721 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7843722 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7843723 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7843724 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7843725 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7843726 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7843727 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7843728 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded
7843729 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with seven to eight houses having been destroyed with serious damage to many others
7843730 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7843731 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7843732 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7843733 repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7843734 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7843767 i believe that in this case it sure would seem to me that the most critical thing to do would have been to inform the public at first time in the morning to ensure that people were aware of this

7843770 the men approached the deputy wanting to know what was going on and did so in an aggressive verbal manner
7843771 there were about seven of them who walked towards him and the deputy fearing for his safety unsheathed his weapon and as soon as he did so it was over

7843778 costas himself pulled no punches in delivering controversial pieces himself and his interview with george w bush was surprisingly eye opening i dont think anyone else has gotten more out of the leader of the free world in eight years
7843779 solidified himself as the second voice of the nba after marv albert
7843780 had a chance to cement his voice in history by correctly putting kobes four point play on saturday nightin the annals of legendary announcing sound bites instead hed rather go with the status quo and sit on his voice box put me in that moment and i would have kicked it good and hood like andres cantor does it every single time someone scores a goal
7843781 i know mike breen and doug collins are the american broadcasters but the players shaking their hands after the game totally unprofessional on breen and collins part
7843782 because they are american announcers and so dadgummit theyre a part of this redemption too
7843783 they are tied a perplexed al trautwig said when the scoreboard showed that despite the even score he was listed as the winner trautwig has been the lead gymnastics announcer since the tiebreaking mechanism was installed for the 2000 olympics and he still doesnt know it exists
7843784 tim daggett and bela karolyi lost credibility with their continued whining over how the american women had been slighted by the less experienced judges
7843785 the broadcast team of daggett elfi schlegel and play by play man al trautwig was nearly nauseating in their heavy bias in favor of american shawn johnson even after fellow american nastia liukin took gold in the womens all around
7843786 lots of times when daggett is talking you dont just want to mute the tv you want to break the speakers
7843787 i truly enjoyed the excitement of bela karolyi and the heartfelt love for his sport
7843788 a man with passion bravely speaking truth to power what better host could meet the press ask for
7843789 i could only understand about a third of what karolyi was saying but even that third was more entertaining than anything the three announcers nbc had doing gymnastics ever said

7843796 hop on board the controversy train with his usual recklessness on monday night marveling with boldon over bolts performance then playing the scold unprompted
7843797 yes there were some who sided with costas and boldon but the overwhelming bulk of the responses were vehemently pro bolt

7843801 had a chance to cement his voice in history by correctly putting kobes four point play on saturday nightin the annals of legendary announcing sound bites instead hed rather go with the status quo and sit on his voice box put me in that moment and i would have kicked it good and hood like andres cantor does it every single time someone scores a goal
7843802 i know mike breen and doug collins are the american broadcasters but the players shaking their hands after the game totally unprofessional on breen and collins part
7843803 because they are american announcers and so dadgummit theyre a part of this redemption too
7843804 they are tied a perplexed al trautwig said when the scoreboard showed that despite the even score he was listed as the winner trautwig has been the lead gymnastics announcer since the tiebreaking mechanism was installed for the 2000 olympics and he still doesnt know it exists
7843805 tim daggett and bela karolyi lost credibility with their continued whining over how the american women had been slighted by the less experienced judges
7843806 the broadcast team of daggett elfi schlegel and play by play man al trautwig was nearly nauseating in their heavy bias in favor of american shawn johnson even after fellow american nastia liukin took gold in the womens all around
7843807 lots of times when daggett is talking you dont just want to mute the tv you want to break the speakers
7843808 i truly enjoyed the excitement of bela karolyi and the heartfelt love for his sport
7843809 a man with passion bravely speaking truth to power what better host could meet the press ask for
7843810 i could only understand about a third of what karolyi was saying but even that third was more entertaining than anything the three announcers nbc had doing gymnastics ever said
7843811 avoided the histrionics that have characterized some of their past swimming calls they balanced emotion during the 4x100 medley relay with clearly spoken narration and analysis without losing lucidity
7843812 hicks went appropriately bonkers at each phelps victory and ably rooted for foreign world record holders when the american in the race didnt have a shot i particularly enjoyed how hicks would speed up his commentary each time the leader neared the wall urging them on
7843813 someone upstairs needed to give swimming analyst rowdy gaines a stern memo reading youre the analyst not the play by play man
7843814 one of nbcs best analysts a blend of athletic smarts charisma precise analysis and brashness
7843815 hammond is a pros pro whose voice and delivery never change regardless who is winning or losing boldon never once tried to make an excuse for the disappointing u s track team
7843816 backed down to admit that he did not know usain that well and that he had misread his celebration
7843817 hop on board the controversy train with his usual recklessness on monday night marveling with boldon over bolts performance then playing the scold unprompted
7843818 yes there were some who sided with costas and boldon but the overwhelming bulk of the responses were vehemently pro bolt
7843819 se trata de un proyecto de unos 140 000 d lares para la construcci n de un muro de gaviones dep sito de asfalto y pintar los encintados

7843821 the challenge isnt to figure out how to write i realized but why
7843822 gentleman to share and relate with my choices in life both past and present
7843823 they basically just needed a little updated information on our operations here
7843824 i think in finding out how much we actually do and how little it costs the taxpayers a year less than 6 each they just decided it was worth keeping
7843825 were not going to cure cancer but were going to help somebody cure cancer
7843826 grid computing allows scientists to test more hypotheses which allows them to discover more stuff this will increase the rate of scientific discovery
7843827 were hearing that the generation retiring in the next few years often arent interested in completely stopping their work lives
7843828 although they may no longer wish to work full time year round they might consider
7843829 there are many ways we can help retirees remain part of the university honor their contributions and use their wisdom to advance others
7843830 people often devote a huge portion of their lives to the university and it seems only right that we give them something back
7843831 i am very proud that binghamton university has once again being recognized by u s news amp world report as one of americas best universities
7843832 binghamton consistently ranks among the elite public institutions due to its excellent reputation among peer institutions and the quality of its students faculty and staff we work very hard to be an exceptional university and these rankings validate those efforts
7843833 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
7843834 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
7843835 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
7843836 our study may show that the world bank and imf can improve the human rights practices of developing countries if they choose to do so another possibility is that democratization was the unintended consequence of structural adjustment policies because the policies stimulated social movements to resist them those social movements or resistance may have been the basis of or at least contributed to the further development of democracy in authoritarian or nascent democratic regimes
7843837 they are interested in bejing opera and very excited everything is fresh in each class
7843838 because its a different culture the students dont know so much about bejing opera
7843839 theres a need to explain the conventions of the opera
7843840 lets welcome out olympic sportsmen in all the country lets hail their dignity and their merit lets do for them all what we can
7843841 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
7843842 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome

7843846 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
7843847 this entire disfranchisement of one half the people of this country their social and religious degradation
7843848 der viel beschriebene boom oder hype der gegenwartskunst ist genauso wie dessen nun vielfach diagnostiziertes ende nicht unser problem nat rlich sind die m rkte breiter geworden asien indien und russland sind neue produktionsorte aber auch k nftige absatzm rkte f r westliche wie internationale kunst relevante kunst jedoch w chst nicht auf b umen und anspruchsvolle und zuweilen auch sperrige positionen zu entdecken und zu verkaufen war nie einfach und geht nicht von selbst es geht um die inhalte darum die beste kunst zu zeigen und sein publikum dauerhaft zu erziehen und zu gewinnen die fragen nach boom und spekulationsblasen berlasse ich gerne denen die das investment und die spekulationsblasen im kunstbereich suchen
7843849 der sogenannte kunstboom hat durchaus auch seine positiven seiten noch nie wurde so viel geld f r k nstlerf rderung und stipendien ausgegeben noch nie kamen mehr besucher in die museen und ausstellungsh user und selten wurde ber zeitgen ssische kunst auf so breiter ebene diskutiert kunstmessen kommen und gehen die erfolgreichen werden bleiben solche entwicklungen sind ganz nat rlich und finden in regelm igen abst nden immer wieder statt das letzte mal wurde das ende des kunstbooms anfang der neunziger jahre ausgerufen das ende der kunst hat es allerdings nicht bedeutet
7843850 der kunstboom ist nicht vorbei im gegenteil die bedeutung von kunst als gradmesser f r zeitgen ssische lebensverh ltnisse wird in den kommenden jahren noch zunehmen was sich ndert ist die infrastruktur des marktes und noch mehr des kunstsystems europa und die usa sind nicht mehr die alleinigen player china indien russland der arabische und afrikanische raum sind dazugekommen die regeln des spiels ver ndern sich kunst kommt nicht mehr prim r aus den g8 staaten l nder mit niedrigem bip afrika lateinamerika asien sind nicht mehr objekte sthetischer ausbeutung picassos negerplastik sondern brechen als produzenten sthetischer haltung und praxis die kunstdominanz des westens auf das recht zu erz hlen ist mehr als nur ein sprachlicher akt hat der kulturtheoretiker homi bhabha einmal geschrieben und das ist das wichtigste resultat des kunstbooms der letzten jahre
7843851 ahora saben por qu se lo ped tanta veces aunque ella dec a que no
7843852 legato dude hoezo laat betalen voor alles het enige waarvoor microsoft ons voor laat betalen en daar kan ik op zeggen mooie zaak ik heb geen zin om uren naar zeurende kleuters of etterende tieners te luisteren als ze moeten betalen om online te gamen dan houd het snel op voor die pubers laat die maar lekker alleen of met vrienden bij hun thuis spelen
7843853 ik hoop dat al die zwervers die een 60 gb ps3 hebben zich genaaid voelen
7843854 als ik ps2 games op een ps2 moet spelen waarom is het dan zo dat die controller niet of nouwelijks aangepast is om ps2 games te kunnen spelen natuurlijk had sony het nooit gedaan met de eerdere versies van de ps3 zou ik het ook niet zo irritant gevonden hebben als nu het is dat er toffe spellen op de ps3 uitkomen maar eigenlijk zou ik niet geassocieerd willen worden met zon kutbedrijf als sony ze zijn maar een haar beter dan micro oft dat iedereen overal voor laat betalen
7843855 slecht nieuws dan gaan ze dus voorlopig lekker door met 5 gb installeren per game
7843856 ik dacht eerst boeie 40gb is prima maar elke updates installaties etc dan is ie zo vol
7843857 wow ps3 met 160 gb wordt van mij wou gisteren een halen maar ik was te laat maar een vraag hoeveel stuks van die ps3 met 160gb komt er dan in nl net als een standaard ps3 of maar een paar
7843858 hallo koop gewoon de 40gb versie deze zal wel snel iets goedkoper worden en bouw zelf een hdd in van 250gb kosten 79 00 snap niet dat sony de ps3 niet ook zonder hdd verkoopt er kom zeker weten nooit meer een backwards compatiblile versie om de reden dat het veelste veel gekl i geeft voor sony als je ps2 wilt spelen koop dan een ps2 groetjes j n
7843859 ik koop pas een ps3 als ie backwards compatible is zal waarschijnlijk wel over een aantal modellen zijn als sony vind dat ie bijna klaar is met zn uitmelkerij
7843860 vind het jammer dat ik nu met een 40 gig versie zit opgescheept maar van de andere kant heb je die ruimte helemaal niet nodig zeker als je net zoals ik een mediabox ernaast hebt staan met een hd van een paar honderd gb die hangt via het netwerk ook aan de ps3 en kun je gewoon alles van afspelen mensen die lopen te zeiken over ps2 compatabiliteit moeten gewoon even de specs lezen voordat ze iets kopen
7843861 nope de 160 gb en 80 gb zijn verder gewoon hetzelfde
7843862 nou ik koop gewoon de 80 gb versie twee maanden wachten op de 160 gb versie duurt me te lang en die 80 gb heeft voor mij voldoende shijfruimte en je kan makkelijk zelf een andere hdd in je ps3 stoppen bovendien is die 70 euri content gewoon een marketing truc want wat je er nou precies voor krijgt is ook maar de vraag en is meer een sigaar uit eigen doos van sony
7843863 ik zie door de bomen het bos niet meer of nee is zie door de geheugen de harde schijf niet meer ik wordt gek van sony elke keer maar goed wiillen verkopen kijk naar de wii 512mb en we zeuren bijna nooit over die halve gb geheugen
7843864 ik wou eerst de 80 gb aanschaffen maar nu ik dit hoor word het zeker een 160 gb
7843865 voor 50 euro meer heb je wel voor 70 euro aan dlc en 2x zoveel opslagruimte
7843866 ik hoef neit perse meer opslagruimte ik wil gvd weer backwards compatibility terug al die goede ps2 games spelen sony maakt eht zichzelf weer makkelijk
7843867 wir wollen eine umsatz gr enordnung von deutlich ber 20 mrd euro erreichen und in einem berschaubaren zeitraum ein nachhaltiges ergebnis vor steuern von einer mrd euro erwirtschaften

7843870 this just does not sound like someone taking responsibility for the major part he played in killing these young women
7843871 im not a real activist or very political but i think barack obama is the right person to be president
7843872 they say we can have about 30 people but right now it looks like a dozen or so people are coming
7843873 we can fit about 10 or 15 comfortably in here but weve got more than one tv so we could handle a little more
7843874 my husband is a registered republican and we both support obama
7843875 hes got a lot of positive energy and i believe he has outstanding leadership and organizational qualities
7843876 he has the electoral stature to cope with the economic issues were facing
7843877 he came from nowhere with a less than opportune background and he has proven himself his heart is with people like him who have worked hard to make it
7843878 confirme pascal laurent porte parole de la conf d ration paysanne
7843879 we want to put in seating and games for families first
7843880 we want a place that families can come and sit down to eat keep them in town
7843881 it will be a place where parents can bring their kids on a friday or saturday night
7843882 we would like to maybe put in some rentable rooms for parties and we would love to have some parking
7843883 this is such a nice place with a beautiful school system
7843884 the downtown area is what is really holding west lafayette back from really really looking nice
7843885 we could begin re building downtown one building at a time maybe if i improve my building other businesses will want to come in and improve theirs
7843886 im just wondering what you consider a reasonable amount of time id hate to file a lawsuit to do this
7843887 i just got back in the office but ill contact the attorney today to see what the status is
7843888 it would save a lot if this could be coordinated through one office
7843889 if it is more closely monitored it would mean less of a chance of something happening that would interrupt the consumers utilities
7843890 based on similar plans i think were on the low end of others besides holmes county
7843891 there are many roads that we can take to get to 270
7843892 if mccain does not win florida and ohio he has no chance zero of being the 44th president of the united states
7843893 sen mccain is a man who has been in the senate for more than 20 years and is relatively well known to the american people
7843894 then you have sen obama who is not as well known nationally someone people are still getting to know
7843895 and i think that there is much more room for growth on sen obamas side than on sen mccains if ohio voters are not for sen mccain now its not likely they ever will be
7843896 what bush did in 2004 was max out the republican vote
7843897 the question is can john mccain do the same thing if the answer is no mccains cooked in ohio
7843898 weve seen a massive pick up in enthusiasm and volunteer activity in the past four to six weeks
7843899 he has to get out there in the small towns the suburbs the rural areas and take ted strickland with him
7843900 teds enormously popular he can go all over ohio and say look this fellow is all right
7843901 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7843902 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7843903 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7843904 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7843905 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7843906 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7843907 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7843908 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7843909 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7843910 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7843911 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7843912 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7843913 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7843914 we investigated the association between vitamin use and depression in 3 different ways none of which showed an advantage of b vitamins compared with placebo over 24 months change in beck depression index bdi scores incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms and remission of depression

7843922 the patient concerned had had a metal plate secured by screws inserted overseas which needed to be removed
7843923 during the procedure it became apparent that the type of screw used had a head which is not used in orthopaedic equipment in the uk
7843924 the surgeon had a choice of abandoning the procedure or acquiring a screwdriver
7843925 he made a judgment that it was in the patients best interests to continue with the operation and so asked a colleague to go out and obtain a screwdriver

7843936 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
7843937 the government is not willing to declare a state of emergency because it will damage the atmosphere

7843967 the chronic features of tuberculosis in these patients suggest that extensively drug resistant tuberculosis may be acquired through previous treatments that include second line drugs aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains
7843968 48 per cent of patients with xdr tuberculosis often termed untreatable in press reports responded favourably to treatment
7843969 keshavjee and colleagues have shown that both mdr and xdr tuberculosis can be cured with aggressive treatment with use of the most effective antituberculosis drugs available

7843986 i think we can match them once we are up to scratch on the day i have played in the mls and the difference in the standard of play isnt great we have some good talent in our squad as well and some experience too i believe once we can settle early and work to our plan then a good result is a definite possibility

7843989 axon is a global leader in its field we believe there is room for a counterbid closer to 700 pence a share
7843990 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition
7843991 the offer from infosys represents an attractive cash premium and provides certainty of value today for axon shareholders we are therefore unanimously recommending the offer to shareholders

7843998 we have always said that the indian armed forces will participate in trouble shooting peace making and peace keeping whenever the un asks us to do whereever we have the blue berret as a rallying point

7844209 according to recent records from the maryland state department of taxation and assessments citizens services inc s ability to do business in maryland was forfeited less than 2 months after the 2006 primary
7844210 obviamente respeitamos a decis o do presidente da rep blica mas mantemos a nossa posi o de discord ncia em rela o lei de seguran a interna
7844211 com a nova lei vamos ter um secret rio de estado acima de dois ministros gerar uma hierarquia cheia de ambiguidades e provocar conflitos entre o ministro da justi a e o ministro da administra o interna
7844212 a lei em vez de vir melhorar a coordena o trar mais descoordena es entre as for as e servi os de seguran a
7844213 depois de erros colossais na pol tica de efectivos e com cada lei org nica a gerar problemas esta lei n o vem dar os meios que a pol cia necessita para combater a criminalidade

7844215 tats chlich k nnen nun start ups mit kleinem etat den first mover effekt nutzen und risikolos ein social network oder eine community aufbauen die gro en unternehmen die immer schon etwas tr ger agieren haben dann das nachsehen
7844216 wir haben festgestellt dass auf entscheiderebene ein gewaltiger beratungsbedarf besteht hier helfen keine werbeslogans und lange listen von produktfeatures in erster linie geht es diesen unternehmen um langfristige ziele und die darstellung konkreter nutzen und gefahren nicht um kurzfristige vermarktungsmodelle

7844218 all of this will cause a disruption in the colorado economy that we would feel for the next five years
7844219 thats how long it would take for the voting public to realize the damage and support a campaign to overturn all these amendments
7844220 amendment that would ban mandatory union dues for workers who dont want to contribute to the cost of collective bargaining and other activities
7844221 if 90 percent of the population isnt in a union why are they weighing in on this anyway
7844222 the initiatives put forth by the unions are simply a means of trying to blackmail the voters into not being able to have an up or down vote on right to work
7844223 my hope would be that some resolution could come about thats best for business overall
7844224 the more initiatives the more people are going to choose to vote no on everything
7844225 the health insurance initiative alone will cost an average of 9 000 per employee and people arent going to buy 50 hamburgers and chicken sandwiches to pay for it
7844226 health insurance and lessening the absolute power of employers over workers thats what unions try to bargain for people
7844227 its purpose is to weaken unions and its totally hostile to labor because it makes it harder for unions to represent people
7844228 unions lift everyones wages and an attempt to weaken them should be resisted for that reason alone
7844229 unions are always involved in the rising of the tide and fighting for wages and benefits for all if they have fewer people paying and are less successful in doing that all workers suffer
7844230 i know that i outperform most of my fellow workers

7844503 i can tell you the first time i saw someone die was incredibly painful
7844504 and even now when i watch it in the theaters or if i watch it on a small screen it still affects me deeply
7844505 the strange part about that is almost everyone who made those comments made them before theyd seen a single frame of footage
7844506 i think the film is incredibly sensitive and i think people were quick to judge because its something theyre very afraid of here there was actual footage indisputable evidence that people were climbing over the rail as easy as could be and ending their life at a national monument a place that we treasure and i think thats very scary to people
7844507 any sort of press coverage of this phenomenon here causes people to get ideas
7844508 most suicides are the end product of a long struggle with mental illness
7844509 theyre not the end product of seeing images of people killing themselves we dont show anything that people dont already know the images themselves i dont think are the things that are driving people to the bridge
7844510 all of us came to the same conclusion that we were human beings first and filmmakers second
7844511 and if the opportunity to intervene to try to save someones life came thats the choice that we were going to make
7844512 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7844513 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7844514 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7844515 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
7844516 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7844517 the fact that the president signed the recognition of the independence of both territories is an irreversible act
7844518 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
7844519 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7844520 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7844521 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7844522 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7844523 and i said to myself something is going on here
7844524 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7844525 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7844526 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7844527 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7844528 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7844529 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7844530 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures anymore
7844531 the entire somali coastline is now under control of the islamists
7844532 according to our information the money they make from piracy and ransoms goes to support al shabaab activities onshore
7844533 its crazy we have never seen anything like it in our years of tracking them
7844534 theyve broken all records for piracy in this region and indeed the whole world
7844535 adventure racing is an exciting sport and one of the things we want to do is ensure that younger people are able to compete with some of the older professional athletes who can act as mentors and role models
7844536 the team made a real impression and signalled they will be among the podium finishers in the future
7844537 these are the sort of young athletes we need to see competing regularly
7844538 we certainly expect to see quite a few young people put their hands up and get the opportunity for free entry into this challenging race
7844539 but we are also keen to encourage other people to have a fun adventure race experience we are targeting people who compete in triathlons multisport and short adventure races and those who like to participate in teams
7844540 the new race should appeal to people who currently compete in events like our peak to peak and who are keen to try a new format it allows a group of friends who like the relay format to get together and complete an individual leg each and at the same time get a taste of adventure racing this race doesnt need a support crew which is also a plus
7844541 the course is very exciting this year and is designed not only to test teams but also to allow them to have fun and enjoy the fantastic scenery
7844542 they will need support crews and the fastest team should finish the course in 15 hours and the slowest in 24 hours
7844543 stretching appears to do more than just increase range of motion
7844544 we suspect its activating some of the same things in the cell that exercise activates
7844545 my feeling is you can never go wrong stretching before and after
7844546 stretching a cold muscle i dont think thats a good idea

7844558 the preacher must speak very very clearly so that the listener will leave satisfied and illumined and not dazzled
7844559 the difference between a pastor and an actor is precisely the existential moment the pastor must be poor when he preaches about poverty he must be slandered when he exhorts to endurance in slander while the actor has the task of deceiving by eliminating the existential moment the preacher in fact has the duty in the most profound sense to preach with his own life

7844593 sometimes i find it hard to believe that i played the game professionally for top level sides for 20 years it seems like a lifetime
7844594 it was simply out of the question i spent all my youth with flamengo and practically my entire professional career im eternally grateful for having played a part in the most glorious period of the clubs history
7844595 one of the conditions i insisted upon was that i would be allowed to play in midfield which was my position when i started out in football im not a full back im a midfielder who ended up playing in defence
7844596 i knew that i could play on for longer as a midfielder i really wanted to enjoy that experience and after that id already made up my mind to go back to flamengo to finish my career
7844597 i was the last remaining member of that 1980s generation and so for me it was really special to play a part in winning the brazilian cup in 1990 and particularly the brazilian league title in 1992
7844598 the latter title was probably the trophy that meant the most to me because it helped me say a fond farewell to flamengo
7844599 i think i can only remember scoring one own goal in my career but it was so ridiculous that it should count as several it was in a brazilian league match against sport recife in 1991 they were on the verge of relegation to the second division and needed to win
7844600 i was in middle of the park and without looking up i knocked the ball back to our keeper gilmar but he was on the other side of the box the ball trickled into the net and we could only stand there looking at each other we ended up losing 2 1 how embarrassing
7844601 that said i knew i wasnt going to be a coach i tried my hand at it twice in 1993 94 and later in 1997 but i did it because i love flamengo they asked me to do it and i could never say no to them
7844602 when i used to live in italy i took part in a few tv programs and in brazil i took up the profession for good from the 1998 world cup for me its the perfect progression from a career as a player because i always loved analysing the game
7844603 and i think i managed to learn something in those 20 years out on the pitch

7844613 my husband always said if that plant catches fire you grab your purse and you go
7844614 we knew there was no way to contain the fire and our first purpose would be to protect the exposures of homes and businesses to the south and the homes to the north
7844615 we put a lot of work into the landscaping and my husband and i were married there
7844616 were just so thankful for the firefighters who helped save our home
7844617 both my kids were born here and its upsetting to me but im really just worried about what my tenants are going to do

7844636 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7844637 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil

7844668 there is a lot of bid speculation around this now it started last week when some people were still sceptical but that has changed now
7844669 we believe one possible way of looking at this is that simon propertys stake is not a short term trading transaction and may eventually result in a takeover bid
7844670 neither company however has made comment either way on this we come to this potential conclusion because 1 liberty is one of the most expensive property companies in europe in our view 2 our economists believe that the dollar may rise further against the pound 3 simons management is well regarded by our us colleagues and industry 4 simon property has a strong balance sheet and may see strong value creation opportunities in libertys shopping centre portfolio as it could for example bring in international retailers and shopping centre knowledge 5 libertys portfolio is hard to replicate and simon may see this as the only way to get access to the uk and would be happy to pay a premium for that 6 we believe liberty needs a new strategy and simons move may fit in this
7844671 the groups management appears to be running the business for cash rather than profits which we believe is the correct strategy given awful housing market conditions in the uk

7844684 there is no danger to our farming we are ready to face any challenge government is always ready to help us in any problem the government is like our family we can always approach it and be sure that the response will be positive
7844685 these statements are far from the truth in fact agriculture in punjab has grown manifold the government has been helpful and the farmers enterprising every year the agricultural output is increasing of late we have been diversifying agriculture growing vegetables and other crops
7844686 today the agricultural production has doubled up in comparison to what it was 15 years ago today the farmers are using modern techniques fifteen years ago the production in agriculture was just four to eight quintals per acre today it is 30 to 35 quintals per acre punjab is golden bird in terms of agriculture

7844702 ill think you find that bowlers have been doing things to the ball since cocky was an egg
7844703 one of the reasons why that happens is the legislators always seem to come down on the side of the batsmen
7844704 we saw recently with the ludicrous situation with kevin pietersen changing hands and becoming a left hand batsman they came down on the side of the batsman
7844705 they never seem to come down in favour of the bowlers
7844706 swinging the ball is terribly important to the game of cricket
7844707 it is like leg spin bowling to bowl good leg spin you have to pitch the ball up if you pitch the ball up somebody might whack it for four they might also nick it and get caught at slip
7844708 youve got to do anything you possibly can to keep swing bowling and leg spin bowling in the game of cricket
7844709 the series in 2005 is certainly in my opinion the most memorable test series that ive seen
7844710 so much of that had to do with the fact the ball was swinging if the ball is swinging then the scores arent going to be too big

7844716 the church has always seen the song of solomon as in part an analogy of her own romance with the heavenly bridegroom but this is far from implying that sex is a sacrament nor is this a doctrine of salvation through marriage

7844718 everyone has his or her own idea about respect as a concept so we are opening a dialogue about what that means even more important we are encouraging everyone to strengthen our community by making respect a priority when you give respect you get respect in return respect is mutual and we want to help open these two way lines of communication as a fundamental part of our campus culture
7844719 thank you for writing to inquire about receiving pbs hd in your area im sorry for any frustration this causes you and im happy to respond to your e mail
7844720 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer
7844721 as mentioned in our previous e mail we are launching new satellites to increase the number of hd channels that we are able to offer it is possible that pbs hd may become available at that time however i wouldnt want to speculate on any dates for this or our service provided by other companies
7844722 thank you for your e mail at this time we do not have specific information when the pbs stations will be launched in hd we are currently working on offering more hd channels in the future please log on to our website for more information about new programming and services being added to dish network
7844723 ive been around musicians for years and have always been intrigued by those who were especially gifted

7844725 both divisions have worked closely with each other for years so bringing together these two units will only enhance collaboration and lead to greater opportunities in drug discovery and development
7844726 ive been so impressed with the outpouring of support from people around the world as weve worked to undo the floods damage
7844727 but i must say the fact that you spent so much of your summer doing something good for people hurt by a flood hundreds of miles away from your home makes this an especially precious gift its clear a great deal of love and attention went into making these blankets and on behalf of the university of iowa i want to thank you
7844728 it was remarkable to see the sandbagging efforts and the cleanup process of the many volunteers who helped in the effort
7844729 it is also been remarkable to see the outpouring of generosity by those not affected by the flood thank you on behalf of the student government and the student body for the time and effort you put into making these blankets to aid us during our recovery process

7844740 while only perpetrators can prevent rapes from happening there are many options that students can choose to reduce their individual risk of sexual victimization including the r a d rape aggression defense course personal safety training provided by the university of iowa department of public safety
7844741 an estimated 5 percent of college women experience a completed or attempted rape in a given year
7844742 in a college that has 10 000 female students there would be more than 350 rapes a year according to a survey conducted by the u s department of justice national institute of justice
7844743 most assaults go officially unreported and because victims often do not report most sexual assaults it is difficult to measure the magnitude of this crime
7844744 many women are ashamed or afraid of the reaction they might get from loved ones law enforcement friends or colleagues people still blame the victim or simply refuse to believe them
7844745 only a perpetrator can prevent a sexual assault from happening
7844746 sometimes even if these techniques are followed women and men are sexually assaulted still it is not the victims fault regardless of what they are saying doing eating drinking or when they are walking dancing or asleep
7844747 students engagement in and out of the classroom can have a tremendous impact on their success in and satisfaction with college
7844748 our research here at iowa demonstrates that our students who do get involved in academic and co curricular activities benefit from that involvement in so many ways and are more likely than students who dont get involved to achieve the educational outcomes they and we desire pick one is a way to motivate all our students to have those essential experiences
7844749 this program has tremendous potential to contribute to student success at the university of iowa
7844750 i encourage faculty and staff members to promote student involvement in all their interactions with our first year students

7844905 hier wird aus einigen fonds geld abgezogen und in andere wieder hinein gesteckt so dass sich langsam einige produkte herauskristallisieren
7844906 biotechnologieunternehmen sowie die gesamte pharmabranche trotzen der krise weitestgehend das liegt daran dass der sektor lange zeit ignoriert und untergewichtet wurde weil sich viele investoren vor allem auf finanzwerte und zyklika konzentriert haben die biotech werte erleben daher eine art revival das sich in einer outperformance gegen ber den meisten indizes zeigt

7844937 many growers delay ryegrass control until the spring because they believe it has a protracted emergence pattern and are waiting to spray until it has all emerged
7844938 indeed most emergence takes place in october at or soon after drilling far less occurs in november and december with very little in the spring
7844939 emergence patterns were similar over two years despite seasonal and weed density differences
7844940 with both weeds there will always be a small amount of spring germination but in a well established cereal crop this doesnt create a problem as the resulting plants are less competitive and produce far fewer heads
7844941 you have a better chance of control when the weeds are small in the project we found 70 of ryegrass samples had resistance to at least one herbicide
7844942 we dont know enough about ryegrass resistance to the sulfonylureas but we do know mixtures and sequences should be used and the emphasis should be on a strong pre emergence treatment
7844943 defy has a particular strength on ryegrass theres less need for an autumn follow up spray where a good pre emergence has been used
7844944 if the pre emergence treatment has done a good job theres no need to spray again but we would never advocate starting a ryegrass control programme with a post emergence spray
7844945 its important that growers make use of everything thats available rather than over relying on just one active ingredient
7844946 if youre not intending to do an autumn follow up then its fine to do a spring application of axial the only exception to this is where you have known accase resistance in which case you should switch to a sulfonylurea
7844947 so its another nail in the coffin for the delayed spray
7844948 seeds were shedding a bit later this year which means they could be slightly more dormant and less opportunity to get rid of them pre drilling
7844949 it adds weight to the argument for a strong residual pre emergence treatment

7845033 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7845034 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7845035 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7845036 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible

7845038 the preacher must speak very very clearly so that the listener will leave satisfied and illumined and not dazzled
7845039 the difference between a pastor and an actor is precisely the existential moment the pastor must be poor when he preaches about poverty he must be slandered when he exhorts to endurance in slander while the actor has the task of deceiving by eliminating the existential moment the preacher in fact has the duty in the most profound sense to preach with his own life
7845040 exhorted his friars to use pondered and chaste words in their preaching for the usefulness and edification of the people proclaiming to the faithful the vices and virtues the punishment and glory with a brief speech because on earth the lord spoke brief words

7845042 the idea of public ethics radio is to engage ethicists in discussion of pressing practical dilemmas each program focuses on a particular theme military intervention international trade political corruption and takes as its starting point some more specific issue that is prominent in the public consciousness we see this as an opportunity for intellectually rigorous discussion within a range of topics that can also appeal to listeners who are not academics the first show features thomas pogge yale anu on his proposal to increase access to medicines among the poor well post new ones every few weeks the next one has leif wenar kings college london on the so called resource curse
7845043 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource developments
7845044 we have quite a bit of work to be done to finalize numbers given the early stages that were in today
7845045 the first thing we have to do is get the core team back my hope would be that sometime into the early part of next year well have the full complement of resources
7845046 much of the construction will likely start in the 2013 2014 range so theres a lot of engineering work to be done
7845047 you cant work above 100 per cent capacity theres a significant amount of work here as much as we can handle and more
7845048 weve got the lead time to build the capacity it gives lots of lead time for people to come back and work in the province so we can gear up and well take whatever we can handle
7845049 weve focused on the 8 10 components that really fit our long term strategy and can be built here in our yards and can be moved around effectively
7845050 we think weve structured this in a fashion to get as much work and experience as we can in our available yards and infrastructure as well as protecting the economics of the project
7845051 if were going to be full partners in the industry then you have to behave like partners
7845052 this is not an unusual challenge for the industry but when we have a partner like the province here were comfortable we can work this out
7845053 getting formal agreements done is one step in a long journey
7845054 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada however the government must ensure canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7845055 the economy around here is not build around this contract but it certainly wouldve strengthened our economy going into the next decade or so
7845056 that was everything from the actual announcement to media reaction pieces particularly from people on the street in marystown and community leaders it holds promise for the marystown shipyard peter kiewit offshore facilities for sure
7845057 pko has constructed modules before for the white rose project
7845058 its a natural fit in marystown outside of the fabrication facility in bull arm theres significant commitments for local benefits here and its a good thing if you find yourself in a situation where your yards are fully maximized
7845059 the burin peninsula stands to be one of the brighter spots in the province in regards to what we announced yesterday wednesday and where we go forward in the future
7845060 it speaks to the future of our youth and our grandchildren it speaks quite well
7845061 a big part of this now will hinge on peter kiewit through the bidding process marystown has been mentioned many times by the premier and others in the announcement that theres every hope the bulk of this work that can be done in the province will go to marystown whatever we can handle
7845062 from my perspective marystown is right in the mix to obtain a lot of the work
7845063 anytime you can lever between 20 and 28 billion in tax revenues everyone benefits regardless of where you live in this province that kind of revenue will improve health care social infrastructure education and so on
7845064 no one should say theres no benefits for me because i dont live in mount pearl clarenville etc
7845065 every time bull arm was referenced in the announcement marystown was referenced so these are the two sites for heavy industrial construction the question i have is what percentage of the topsides modules are going to be constructed outside of newfoundland and labrador
7845066 if that super module is bid internationally its highly highly unlikely it can be won provincially
7845067 robinhos cycle in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to a new project
7845068 finally finally russia has acknowledged that we exist and that we have suffered
7845069 i think after russia we will be recognized by for example belgrade for example china and maybe syria and also belarus

7845074 they have no economy whatsoever and they never had any economy
7845075 there is no way it can be a viable entity
7845076 if it were independent it would be a poor rural place its very hard to talk about ossetian independence from russia with a straight face
7845077 i dont think anybody really cares a lot about the south ossetian people
7845078 when youre dating a european woman the slovenly way of dressing will not do but the reality is ive also grown up a lot in the last five years and not getting dressed up is partly teenage rebellion i obviously held on to that for too long but i dont want to get into wearing the uniform of the thirty year old actor either the beanie guy the scarf guy it defeats the purpose of individual expression if i ever have a fashion relapse diane lets me know
7845079 my first cannes experience was my first true fashion moment the tradition is that the director escorts his leading lady up the stairs which left me dateless so my date for the evening became karl lagerfeld theres little canadian me sitting next to karl lagerfeld for four and a half hours it was pretty comical
7845080 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now
7845081 we are excited with the building momentum and look forward to announcing more developments in this important project
7845082 we are a nation rich in spooky sightings and strange phenomena
7845083 the last time we saw such a drop from the u s must have been over 15 years ago

7845169 more like a highway bridge than a dairy farm bridge
7845170 seeing your favourite cows being washed down the river was like losing a pet dog
7845171 i couldnt believe the amount of water that was flowing
7845172 the worst thing was the one staff member to get the cows in this morning was the one with the biggest passion for cows weve ever had here he was stuffed
7845173 we get such a kick out of seeing the work and effort that locals put in
7845174 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours

7845191 were happy for it to be in australia but i think everyone will miss rally new zealand
7845192 its hard to pull such a good rally out of the championship id prefer them both to be in instead of one of them missing out each year but thats the way the rules are
7845193 rally australia has always been a great event too and one of the favourites with the drivers its quite a different rally to new zealand but they are both so good to drive
7845194 i think its the nature of the roads its always good fun to drive its fast and flowing and its usually the fastest guy that wins
7845195 i would rather be fighting for first but its good to be in this position first is a long way away and weve set our goals for third in the championship

7845201 say they refrain from having children but what if they really wanted to you can adopt but knowing that you are able to conceive but shouldnt can be psychologically damaging what if the contraceptives fail you can have an abortion but im sure there is a line somewhere when you are intentionally bringing genetically dysfunctional children to the world and this coming from a pro choice guy it just seems to me there are too many difficulties one must endure to carry on a relationship that satisfies the moral intuition of others but even if they could chances are they wouldnt be having quite a healthy relationship even if we get past the fact that they re brother and sister out of our heads

7845284 ich habe mit senator obama einen menschen getroffen der mich genauso inspiriert wie mein vater es getan hat
7845285 ich wei dass er ein gro artiger pr sident sein wird
7845286 ich kenne noch jemanden der sich von senator obama inspiriert f hlt in meiner familie nennen wir ihn onkel teddy
7845287 er hat das leben f r menschen in diesem land besser gemacht
7845288 er hat es sich nicht nehmen lassen alle seine nichten zum altar zu f hren
7845289 nichts aber auch gar nichts h tte mich davon abhalten k nnen heute hier zu sein ich bin heute hier um amerika zu ndern um seine zukunft zu sichern und um barack obama zum pr sidenten zu machen
7845290 ich verspreche euch dass ich im kommenden januar da sein werde wenn der neue pr sident vereidigt wird
7845291 ich bin heute nacht als ehefrau hierher gekommen die ihren mann liebt und berzeugt ist dass er ein au ergew hnlicher pr sident sein wird
7845292 obwohl er diesen komischen namen hatte merkte ich schnell seine familie war wie meine er stammt aus einer arbeiterfamilie die k mpfen musste die ihren kindern m glichkeiten er ffnete die sie selbst nicht hatte die ihren kindern beibrachte du behandelst andere menschen mit respekt

7845294 ive actually handled one of these and theyre pretty neat especially for opening watch casebacks which is what they were made for
7845295 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7845296 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
7845297 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
7845298 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
7845299 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7845300 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7845301 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7845302 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7845303 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7845304 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7845305 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7845306 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7845307 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7845308 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7845309 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere

7845544 by doing away with the old grading system zc seeks to encourage teamwork rather than individualism and the new system should bring about a unity of purpose that would otherwise not be possible in the old order but players will still be evaluated taking into account their old status with zc as of last season and they will be under contract for the next two years

7845582 yes its true i mentioned before that this was definitely a possibility but i dont believe it is an inevitability but anyway lets define breaking apps that use openclip will no longer be able to copy and paste between applications however applications can still utilize a persistent way to store data inside the application meaning that copy and paste within the app will still work fine and on top of that apps that utilize only one form either copy or paste can disable interface elements when apple axes openclip however even though apple is killing the concept behind the current openclip that doesnt mean we cant change the concept a shared clipboard could be stored in an address book card or even on a remote server those solutions arent as good as the openclip implementation but they arent bad

7845593 i still love my husband and he was good with me
7845594 i discovered that he was fighting the americans recently he told me once that they planted a roadside bomb with a friend and waited for a long time for an american patrol but it was in vain after that they brought a donkey to detonate so civilians wouldnt die
7845595 i was frightened when they put it on my body
7845596 i was worried that it might explode on me they said i wouldnt feel it

7845609 how many secretaries supervisors does it take to change a light bulb in hawkins county
7845610 projected another route to phoenix will be added before long
7845611 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7845612 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7845613 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7845614 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7845615 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7845616 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7845617 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others
7845618 so you need to build a little bridge between the molecules
7845619 at the end of the day csiro is aiming to get biodegradable polymers to perform better than or similar to petrol based products at a competitive cost
7845620 if you can improve the performance of petrochemical derived plastics such as their stiffness and toughness you can reduce wall thickness lowering the amount of plastic used in the manufacture of the product
7845621 there are also energy savings in terms of faster cycle times in the moulding process and transportation installation costs
7845622 conventional flame retardants can reduce mechanical performance and make the material more expensive
7845623 we have shown that on the other hand nano additive based flame retardants can actually improve the mechanical properties of the material without adversely affecting cost
7845624 we need to recognise this problem and search for components we can extract from waste products
7845625 to have a sustainable future in biodegradable polymers we need to source materials from waste products rather than food sources
7845626 in order for companies to adopt biodegradable products the materials have to meet certain international and australian standards csiro has the only facility in australia to do this
7845627 we have just built a state of the art facility to assess biodegradable products against australian and international standards
7845628 csiro is trying to take leadership rather than wait for international developments we need to actively develop capability and technology
7845629 i think if the petrol price remains the way it is then there will be a lot more investment in petrol alternatives
7845630 the market is becoming more receptive to the bioderived and biodegradable plastics as rising oil prices make petroleum based plastics more expensive
7845631 manufacturing industries nowadays are not just looking to materials with a structural purpose but also for functional properties such as fire resistance conductivity or protection from uv degradation
7845632 i will do today what other people wont so that i can have tomorrow what other people wont

7845637 watch out dont do your good deeds publicly to be admired by others for you will lose the reward from your father in heaven
7845638 when you pray dont be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them i tell you the truth that is all the reward they will ever get
7845639 when you pray dont babble on and on as people of other religions do they think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again
7845640 if you forgive those who sin against you your heavenly father will forgive you
7845641 and when you fast dont make it obvious as the hypocrites do for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting i tell you the truth that is the only reward they will ever get

7845647 gt firefighters from the penfield and fairport fire districts participated in a live fire drill at an abandonded home on old penfield road last tuesday
7845648 this is where the more experienced guys will take the new guys and show them things
7845649 the idea here is to train them to put out a fire
7845650 when it does come down to it and its someones house you can take care of it with the least amount of danger to yourselves and the least amount of damage
7845651 the only purpose of the rit crew is to go in and get that firefighter
7845652 weve had people fall through floors and fall through ceilings
7845653 they learn how to make doorways and make corners and see how the fire behaves
7845654 its good when you get a chance to cross train
7845655 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
7845656 de onderzoekers geven wel toe dat ze niet weten of er inderdaad meer inbreuken zijn gepleegd of dat er sneller melding van gemaakt wordt
7845657 feit is dat dit jaar al minstens 22 miljoen consumentengegevens zijn verloren gegaan maar de werkelijke cijfers liggen volgens identity theft resource center veel hoger in 41 procent van de inbreuken werd immers niet gemeld hoeveel consumentenbestanden er waren verdwenen bovendien zijn nog altijd een aantal bedrijven die het gegevensverlies niet melden of er zich zelfs niet van bewust zijn

7845886 natuurlijk het raakt het onderwerp van leven en dood aan en dat ligt voor veel mensen gevoelig ik zit er niet mee ik sta graag in de controverse en de dood zelf heeft me nooit afgeschrikt ik was als kleine jongen al menselijke schedels aan het afkoken en als zeventienjarige werkte ik als hulpverpleger toen heb ik mijn eerste lijken gezien en heb ik geleerd het is iets heel normaals de dood is er voor ons en zal er na ons zijn het leven is een wimperknip in tijd en ruimte
7845887 dat hangt ervan af wat je onder kunst verstaat ik noem het anatomische kunst een esthetisch didactische presentatie van het innerlijke lichaam ik zoek in mijn specimens elegantie en schoonheid maar ik wil mensen ook doen beseffen dat hun lichaam sterfelijk is op de tentoonstelling zie je rooklongen zieke levers lichamen met overgewicht dat doet nadenken
7845888 zandhoven is in trek omdat de omgeving er groen en landelijk is
7845889 en het heeft de reputatie minder duur te zijn dan schilde en brasschaat
7845890 oudere mensen verkopen hun villa en trekken in een comfortabel appartement liefst in dezelfde gemeente en de prijs en de leninglast speelt vaak geen rol
7845891 daar zijn pas een heleboel dure nieuwbouwflats met uitzicht op de schelde gebouwd
7845892 in de rupelstreek zijn wel meer van dat soort dure appartementen aan het water gebouwd hoor in boom bijvoorbeeld maar die staan er nog maar een jaar of vijf die komen pas weer terug in de statistieken als ze opnieuw worden verkocht
7845893 het blijft misschien wel ons kind maar dit vergeven we haar nooit
7845894 we kunnen het gewoon niet geloven die twee dutskes wie kan ze nu zoiets aandoen elke keer als je zulke dingen op het nieuws ziet hoop je dat je zoiets nooit moet meemaken ik hoop dat we dit te boven komen
7845895 vreselijk gehuild heb ik toen ik van dat drama in brussel hoorde daar had een mama vijf kindjes vermoord nu zitten we er zelf midden in onwezenlijk is dit
7845896 ze was altijd heel afwezig vertelde niet veel we wisten dat ze vaak in de problemen zat dat zag je gewoon aan haar gezicht maar iets vertellen dat deed ze nooit ze nam veel medicijnen antidepressiva denk ik allemaal dingen die ze van hem haar echtgenoot marcel red kreeg van in het begin heb ik geweten dat hij voor problemen zou zorgen als dokter heb ik geen kwaad woord over hem maar naar zijn gezin zag hij niet om
7845897 maar het is pas echt fout gelopen toen junior geboren werd twee huilende en ruzi nde kinderen daar kon hij niet tegen een paar maanden geleden is hij thuis weggegaan hij wilde gewoon geen contact meer gaf ook geen geld meer en dat kon chantal niet verkroppen ze heeft dit gedaan om hem te raken daar ben ik zeker van daarom ook dat ze de andere kinderen eerst met een smoes heeft weggestuurd ik vrees dat ze alles gepland had het is niet schoon om te zeggen maar eigenlijk had ze veel meer moeten hebben dan een gebroken heup
7845898 de gemeente had nochtans beloofd dat de opritten af en toe zouden worden vrijgemaakt
7845899 toen ik na de eerste week vroeg om tijdens het weekend weer op mijn oprit te kunnen weigerden de arbeiders mij te helpen het was pas na een telefoontje naar schepen van openbare werken max frans dat er dan toch een bak zand tegen mijn oprit werd gegooid zodat ik met de auto binnen en buiten kon maar het bouwsel was te licht om er met de mobilhome over te rijden ik was al blij dat ik er met mijn gewone wagen over kon
7845900 ik maakte zelf een constructie met planken maar die was uiteraard onvoldoende sterk om een zwerfwagen van 3 ton te dragen
7845901 toen ik vrijdagavond van mijn werk kwam was er geen arbeider meer te bespeuren zodat ik weer voor schut stond intussen had ik al een mail naar het gemeentebestuur gestuurd maar ik ontving geen reactie ik ben van plan zoersel in gebreke stellen voor al de dingen die misliepen ik reken erop dat mijn oprit het laatste weekend van augustus vrij is want ik trek er dan hoe dan ook op uit desnoods schakel ik daarvoor een bouwfirma in die de zaak oplost en de factuur naar de gemeente stuurt

7845926 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7845927 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7845928 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7845929 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using ajax offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7845930 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike
7845931 most people today know the basics about popular software programs like microsoft excel the problem is they still dont understand how to use more advanced functions like how to create a pivottable

7845938 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the two parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7845939 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7845940 id like it to be a little bit more secure in who exactly is going to be doing the punt returning but i think weve made progress in some of the things we are doing
7845941 maybe it hasnt shown up statistically especially in the punt return game but weve made progress up front in our blocking both in kick return and punt return i think we are in a good spot right now we just have to settle on whos going to do it and we still have some options so we just have to play it out this weekend and see how it goes
7845942 so we have options its not like we dont have anyone its just we dont have a single guy right now that we can say will be taking all the reps thats not a bad thing either though weve got plenty of options and were going to use them as we go
7845943 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7845944 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7845945 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7845946 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7845947 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7845948 the quicker the better obviously because then you can start back on the whole recovery thing
7845949 its too bad hes worked very hard and i know being a high profile pick a no 1 pick theres a lot of pressure put on that and expectations of fans its not his fault and hes trying his best to get back and were still counting on him to help us this year
7845950 its a group that has been such a steady group for us over the years and we really havent been healthy since the end of last season
7845951 once again its part of the game i concern myself with injuries more on a personal note than how it affects our team because you have to deal with it and thats what were prepared to do i wouldnt say the injuries are affecting the way we are moving forward but it is a part of our camp right now that is very unfortunate
7845952 eventually we hope that hes the good player we think he is
7845953 he was a good player in college he had some injuries in college and we need to get past that we dont think theres anything fundamentally wrong with him we dont think its a lack of toughness we just think hes just had some bad luck we think hes going to be a good part of a good group
7845954 it stays in the back of my head but i cant dwell on that either
7845955 thats not going to get me anywhere i know what im capable of my no 1 focus right now is to get back out there on the field again and see what happens
7845956 you have to find the people who really care about you and keep your head up and keep working
7845957 they just tell me we believe in you we believe in what you can do thats good to hear that come from people who care about you

7845966 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7845967 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7845968 prime minister fukuda is the type to quietly get things done not the type for flashy performances
7845969 even when we are past 40 they treat women as children using the term girl
7845970 didnt win the battles but they did isolate france in the world and they made de gaulle realise that he had to give up algeria if france was ever to be a great power again
7845971 i realised that it wasnt enough just to study relations between states that international and even non government organisations could be increasingly important so i wanted to study something where the united nations and ngos would be front and centre from the word go
7845972 i wanted to figure out how even at the height of the cold war 50 years ago whether were looking at the spread of transnational jihadist movements or the increasing importance of the international media or the way the un becomes a battleground you could see a lot of the things that people associate with the post cold war world already up and running
7845973 we live in a world where people count other people as a way to understand political change in countries like france islam is already the second largest religion whats that going to mean is france going to be france in the future when the population of france changes so profoundly
7845974 but when having a national identity and having citzenship came instead with a whole set of rights and privileges like receiving social security and free medical care and all the rest it became important to count people not just as people but as citizens and also to begin to exclude certain people who were thought unworthy or incapable of being citizens
7845975 even in prussia in the 1880s people were crossing the border relatively freely in fact the united states was a pioneer in tracking movement across borders and beginning to exclude certain kinds of people from citizenship the first laws to ban asian immigration in the us started in the 1870s
7845976 over time this became a global trend as you would know from australian history australia south africa canada and eventually several states in latin america began to exclude chinese immigrants and the idea was that if you allowed in these people which seemed lesser people and your own citizens had to compete with them for lower wages there would be a race to the bottom where the chinese people who could live on less and reproduce more would come to outnumber everyone else so that was the idea behind what became a world wide movement to contain asians within their own continent
7845977 the eugenicists were prominent among the members of the early immigration control movements especially in the us they tried to export their ideas worldwide they found many people who were willing to work with them you will find there were eugenics movements across south america in india china in japan they werent all the same but there were commonalities among people who believed it would be possible to breed better people
7845978 populations are always out of control if you want to control fertility for instance the only way you can do that with any certainty or predictability is through coercion as china did with the one child policy
7845979 by the end of the 19th century there was a neo malthusian league that had branches across europe these were relatively small organisations but over time some women people like margaret sanger in the us began to think that providing contraception to women would be a way to empower them to give them control over their lives
7845980 signed up in a sense for a whole agenda of not just giving women contraception but also making sure that those who were unfit would be prevented from having children
7845981 typically it was women on public assistance or women who were in institutions but in some cases women who were considered to be anti social women who were of loose morals who on a doctors order or by the ruling of a judge would be subject to compulsory sterilisation
7845982 what us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes said was that just as the state can order compulsory immunisation so too can it order compulsory sterilisation he was actually talking about a family the woman in questions name was carrie buck based on the evidence presented to the court he believed this was a family of imbeciles in fact generations of imbeciles
7845983 well it turned out that they were nothing of the kind at the time people had a very vague sense of what they called feeble mindedness and all sorts of people including carrie buck were swept up people who typically didnt have money or education were sterilised sometimes with no notion of what was happening to them in some cases they were told they were getting an appendectomy so the us pioneered not just control of migration and exclusion of asian immigrants but also the compulsory sterilisation of their own citizens and thats something that became common in many countries across scandanavia in japan and most notoriously in nazi germany
7845984 you know the evidence is that these kinds of programs only have a very marginal impact on the fertility rate if governments want to make it easier for parents to have kids they should do it because its good policy rather than cash most parents would rather have decent maternity and paternity leave and especially access to decent day care and child care options those are the kinds of policies that i think actually do make a difference for parents
7845985 what im afraid of if not in australia then in other countries is that when these kinds of policies dont work as they have not worked in the past that governments will try more coercive policies
7845986 the nazis tried this and so did mussolinis italy stalins ussr and vichy france all of them tried to increase fertility rates by withdrawing access to contraception in france beginning in the 1920s it was illegal to even advocate use of birth control and under vichy women who performed abortions were sent to the guillotine
7845987 what happens when you try to increase fertility rates by withdrawing contraception and access to abortion
7845988 a lot of people die because women in desperate circumstances will get abortions illegally and they will often get unsafe abortions a more recent example is romania under ceau escu where the maternal mortality rate soared when they withdrew access to abortion
7845989 thats why im arguing that if were going to provide access to contraception which we should and if were going to provide access to safe and legal abortion and if were also going to provide access to infertility treatment so parents can have help in having children if they want and need it we should do it because its the right thing to do from a moral point of view not because we think its going to raise or reduce infertility rates
7845990 bedeutung wuppertals und der bergischen region f r das land nordrhein westfalen
7845991 we are very pleased with the outcome of this exploratory study
7845992 we are particularly interested in the responses around skin quality as this is the first time we have assessed the isolagen therapy for these important skin characteristics
7845993 as the principal investigator in the isolagen it r 007 trial i am optimistic about the study results which show improvement in patients facial appearance
7845994 the results suggest that improvements in both skin texture and contour may be achieved following isolagen treatment i believe this outcome is a unique finding in the cosmetic injectable treatment market utilizing the subjects own living cells to provide the basis for improvement
7845995 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7845996 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7845997 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7845998 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7845999 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7846000 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7846001 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7846002 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7846003 unison has a long and happy relationship with south connections who are wonderfully colourful and exhilarating
7846004 notting hill is one big street party where everyone is welcome
7846005 south connections reflect the diversity of people working in todays nhs we welcome the overseas nurses doctors dentists and other health workers without them our national health service would collapse we see day to day the valuable contribution they all make
7846006 last year south connections were crowned best adult historical band winner and with unisons help we hope to repeat that with this years theme aztecs the lost empire
7846007 i am proud to take part and to be one of more than a hundred nhs workers in our group the notting hill carnival shows how people from many different races and backgrounds can come together have fun and celebrate the richness and diversity of our communities
7846008 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
7846009 additionally the challenges of an ageing society means that the government must now grasp the nettle of reform to the social care system with real urgency
7846010 in employment these figures clearly show the economic harm that will be caused to uk plc by continuing to exclude older people from the active workforce
7846011 changes to our population are inevitable over time an ageing society is a fact of life which should be welcomed and embraced not treated with concern these new figures should give everyone pause for thought about our future
7846012 a decision to have breast reconstruction surgery is a decision to have plastic surgery and that ought to be done by a plastic surgeon this is what we train for and do everyday plastic surgeons have pioneered and refined all of the state of the art techniques in breast reconstruction including implant approaches and autologous tissue natural transfers
7846013 asps member surgeons are carrying out the cutting edge research for constant outcomes improvement our members have the foremost training education and experience in breast reconstruction and should be a part of every breast care team
7846014 thats a success and satisfaction rate that should not be compromised
7846015 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally as long as children remain unvaccinated they are at risk it is essential that all children regardless of where they are born have the opportunity to be vaccinated against measles so that they can grow up healthier and without fear of this highly contagious but entirely preventable disease
7846016 the start of the clinical study for pmx 30063 represents a major milestone for polymedix and we believe for the entire medical community
7846017 this novel antibiotic compound signals a fundamental potential breakthrough in treating infectious diseases pmx 30063 is the first and only small molecule defensin mimetic to commence clinical development for the treatment of systemic infections and the first and only such compound whose mechanism of action is intended to directly address the major problem of bacterial drug resistance we are proud to be the first company to bring this completely new type of antibiotic to clinical trials and to address a major clinical need and market opportunity
7846018 the lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response
7846019 these crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a test organisms for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments says ms chung
7846020 they accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants
7846021 parents usually dont understand their role in the course of their childs career development and cross the line between involvement and intervention
7846022 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7846023 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7846024 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7846025 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught
7846026 our new topical spray approach to protecting individuals during seasonal or epidemic flu outbreaks is a radical new paradigm to protect people from these influenza viruses the fact that the anadis antibodies are all natural and topically applied means we may have a very safe and effective new approach to provide immediate protection to all persons and be able to address multiple virus strains we know from current failures in vaccine protection among many persons this past year that indeed novel approaches like this are urgently needed
7846027 this work supports an aggressive commercial strategy expanding our intellectual property position in this unique area our approach shows for the first time a cost effective method of fighting influenza using antibodies we plan to move on our own and with partners to bring this revolutionary product to market
7846028 wed characterize vaxinnates m2e universal influenza vaccine candidate as very promising based upon the immune responses and tolerability we saw in the clinical trial participants
7846029 utmb is committed to further studies of vaxinnates vaccine candidate which has the potential to be a safe highly effective and much needed option to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza a
7846030 were very pleased with the study data which demonstrate that vaxinnates m2e universal flu vaccine candidate is safe and capable of eliciting a more potent immune response by delivering a one two punch that triggers both arms of the bodys immune defense
7846031 furthermore it accomplishes this at doses below a microgram of vaccine antigen and without the use of conventional adjuvants in short this vaccine candidate has passed a critical initial test with data that have exceeded our expectations
7846032 this is a major milestone for kamada there is significant potential for the aerosolized version of aat which is an innovative approach for treatment of chronic inflammatory processes that could potentially prevent degeneration of lung function we believe that pending the successful completion of the trials and registration process this formulation could considerably improve the quality of life and potentially extend the life expectancy of a wide range of cystic fibrosis patients
7846033 we are extremely pleased with this major achievement aerosolized administration of aat for cystic fibrosis holds great potential for the treatment of these severely diseased patients we are eager to pursue the development of this product and demonstrate the benefit for this patient population as well as other respiratory populations
7846034 not only the absence of infirmity and disease but also a state of physical mental and social well being
7846035 in previous clinical studies adentri has exhibited the potential to optimize fluid management without harmful effects on renal function heart failure patients with renal insufficiency are at risk for poor clinical outcomes and are among the most difficult to treat as currently available therapies negatively impact renal function
7846036 we are excited to see adentri enter into phase iii studies as one of biogen idecs lead cardiopulmonary programs
7846037 following lixivaptan adentri marks the second novel compound in biogen idecs cardiopulmonary franchise that is in phase iii clinical trials for heart failure patients we look forward to advancing this and our other programs in the future

7846057 identified fingerprinted interviewed photographed and processed for removal from the u s
7846058 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7846059 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7846060 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7846061 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their co operation and ask that they remain patient we will ensure people are kept updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
7846062 i thought the police would be finished by now but its gone on another week
7846063 i thought they would have arrested the man at the same time

7846066 the dogs just emerged from behind the farmers house we knew straight away that they werent with anyone at the farm because of the state they were in
7846067 it was terrible they were so bad they had no hair and there was blood coming from all over them
7846068 while we were waiting for someone to come we tied the dogs up as we simply couldnt have them running about no one knew what sort of infections they may have
7846069 they were really friendly its sad ive never seen anything like it in my life
7846070 i imagine this would have cost somebody quite a lot of money to treat and thats why the dogs were dumped its highly unlikely they ran away from their owners and ended up on the farm
7846071 the dogs will have been suffering from this skin condition for months though and they will have been in great pain it will also have driven them nuts imagine having things crawling all over you for so long the vet told me it was the worst case he had ever seen
7846072 they are very canny dogs and are certainly not aggressive unfortunately such dogs often have a fighting future as their destiny but there is no evidence of that with this pair
7846073 they dont have scars and they still have their ears which is a very good start
7846074 but could we be on the cusp of an historic back to the city shift the case is building
7846075 check such cities as atlanta and washington he suggests theyre beginning to resemble historic vienna or paris the centuries old pattern in which the people of means chose to live near the vital city centers while the poor were left to live in the less expensive outskirts
7846076 atlanta for example is seeing so many better off whites move in that its decades old status as a predominantly black and low income city may soon be reversed conversely suburban clayton and dekalb counties are already registering black majorities while simultaneously serving as immigrant gateways

7846082 diesels operate more efficiently within the right rev range and fewer revolutions mean less friction so a 2 5 litre diesel engine hammering down the m4 at 4 200rpm is not very efficient when with modification it could be doing it at 1 000rpm diesel engines are torque rich but brake horse power poor
7846083 the most important thing is optimizing the efficiency of an engine in formula one the optimum rev point is 18 000rpm which means that all gear changes occur at this figure with the iceni r it is 3 500rpm and our computer model shows that at 56mph the engine generates 402rpm and that works out at 71 5mpg

7846087 we already had a powerful compensation plan rich with bonuses and onetime commissions now it quickly covers the monthly subscription fees associated with being in business with vmdirect
7846088 with the economy worsening it was important we enhanced our program so our business partners could create a more lucrative multiple stream of income the new enhancements are absolutely brilliant and are already creating a buzz of excitement within our affiliate base not seen before
7846089 we believe a majority of our affiliate base will upgrade as it just makes good economic sense
7846090 for example when one of our affiliates builds an organization of 6 business partners who resell the products and services and has 3 retail customers subscribing to our helloworld or first stream communication tools they earn roughly 18 us dollars per month with the new enhancements this same affiliate will now earn approximately 120 us dollars covering a majority if not all of their monthly fee for their home based business on average now it will only take 5 business partners to cover monthly fees making this perhaps the most lucrative plan in the home based business sector
7846091 they offered us an alternative to costly upgrades of legacy systems instead we invested in feature rich next generation network gear that grows with our needs
7846092 we are delighted to participate in fintels timely network expansion as they play a pivotal role in international telecommunications

7846095 the important thing is to choose an ssl vendor with security in their dna
7846096 security is all we do and with cybercriminals committed to escalating their craft someone has to take security on as a full time job the key is to find an ssl provider that is a security expert but not be forced to pay a premium
7846097 one of the reasons behind the development of the ev ssl standard was to raise the bar for security across the board and boost customer confidence in the online channel
7846098 developing this rigorous standard allowed us to offer the same quality ssl certificate for a more affordable price
7846099 any additional layer of security consumers can sense will provide greater confidence in the organization as well as create greater loyalty with customers that can be lost easily with a few mouse clicks

7846119 im extremely excited to be taking part in the democratic convention and supporting the launch of newsone com
7846120 i hope to set an example to our young people and convey the message that we all have to make it our business to get involved in this years election because this is the time for great changes to be made
7846121 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7846122 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7846123 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7846124 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7846125 im not built for all that i was built to write
7846126 there was an error saving one or more of the attachments pleas check your free disk space and try again
7846127 we always talked about when an opportunity came up would i be interested
7846128 so theres been a cultivation process there i plan on coaching for a while
7846129 the advantages at being at an institution for a long period of time theres so many the most people dont realize
7846130 my strength in coaching has always been the relationship with my players
7846131 im a relationship builder i miss the full time seeing the kids during the day being with them for all the practices seeing them in the off season following them after graduation all the things you do in a correct way to run a program ive missed
7846132 but i look at them instead of stumbling blocks as stepping stones im doing something i love to do and thats priceless
7846133 everybody ive met has been impressive in a small way i think i have a chance to make a difference for the school in its academic mission and its athletic mission
7846134 i take great pride in representing daniel webster but my team will take great pride in representing daniel webster
7846135 my first priority is to the players and to developing that relationship i cant wait until they get on campus
7846136 ive been put in a lot of different positions to coach and i think one of my strengths is i feel i can make more from less
7846137 when president robert myers brought me here he wanted a change in atmosphere in our department
7846138 what can we do to better the programs totally this is just a followup from that
7846139 its not dave faucher being a savior to daniel webster its dave faucher being appreciative to daniel webster thats really the theme
7846140 for tom if we decide to play him then that will be an opportunity for him and if we dont decide to play him or he cant play or whatever it is then it will be an opportunity for someone else
7846141 if certain players dont play then the other players at that position get more of an opportunity to play whatever spot that is
7846142 that is something that matt cassel gutierrez and kevin i think all look for that opportunity to play their position get a chance to perform contribute and show what they can do
7846143 last friday night we saw a little over a half with cassel and less than a half with gutierrez i am sure this week against the giants we will see kevin get a chance to play some and we will figure out what the rest of the playing time is based on everyones availability and so forth
7846144 i thought matt did a good job leading the team with the opportunities he had
7846145 thats my responsibility to try to stay calm and recognize what they are doing and run our offense
7846146 at times we did a decent job at other times we didnt we strung some plays together but the drives still werent perfect there is still a lot of room for improvement we came up short on points so whatever job we did it still wasnt enough
7846147 you always want your leader out there but what if hes not out there week 7
7846148 we are the patriots we have to find a way to win
7846149 it may come out where we may have to be without tom so its up to whoever is in there to execute
7846150 they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7846151 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die
7846152 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7846153 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7846154 well hossa is good for one or two or for setting a couple up
7846155 its going to be me im going to do it
7846156 its up to us to show them that they were wrong
7846157 were looking at sunny and clear for the rest of the week and warm
7846158 its beautiful and its great that im not having allergies
7846159 its tough to work when its hot out though i try to be professional but its harder to lift luggage at the airport when its hot out im lucky i have a car with ac
7846160 but just like the weather woman says be cool california
7846161 typically people get home from school it cools off they come downtown have a bite to eat and hang out at the last market
7846162 it is our understanding that when david vestal came out of the residence he was shot without warning he did not have a shotgun or any other firearm
7846163 we dont think theres going to be any wrongdoing on the part of the officers
7846164 it was by a former lifeguard and fisherman he knows what he saw that is why we are confident it was a great white shark
7846165 i have a lot of kids today i let them go knee deep and let them play with their boogie boards
7846166 they are in cold water hence they feed on seals with all the fat and spit out people
7846167 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7846168 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7846169 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7846170 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7846171 before weaning the mother has the monopoly on providing resources directly to her offspring
7846172 these folks if you cut them loose they wont have things to do during the day
7846173 the money is also going to stay in the community
7846174 employing two dozen people is huge especially in the economic times we are in trying to find jobs for anybody and on top of that someone with a disability
7846175 it would be as devastating as anyone of us to lose their job
7846176 there really are benefits for a community to having a diverse crew workers just to have people who are not like everybody else necessarily
7846177 a lot of people who use the parks have become friends with our workers it is not something you can measure certainly not monetarily
7846178 it is not a public works construction contract so you can evaluate the services it provides you can be subjective
7846179 if this is clearly a council priority you can structure the work strictly to the strengths of the work force
7846180 v lkerrechtlich w rde selbst eine anerkennung s d ossetiens und abchasiens durch russland nichts an der territorialen integrit t georgiens ndern weil diese durch verschiedenste resolutionen des un sicherheitsrates sogar mit russischer unterst tzung immer wieder best tigt wurde
7846181 by being the biggest constituency in the country youths are key stakeholders in issues of national development therefore addressing the needs of young people is meeting the needs of the majority
7846182 by bringing youths from all corners of the country the festival empowers youths in the marginalized parts of our community with opportunities to showcase their talents
7846183 the festival will be an annual vehicle which will promote african art not only in zimbabwe but the rest of africa this cross pollination of african art will enrich the cultures of the participating youths
7846184 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7846185 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7846186 youve got to take it all the good and the bad
7846187 i always had faith what i did last year 2 4 3 29 in 42 appearances with new haven county was pretty good i said im not going to reconstruct my delivery or anything like that im going to stay the same im still confident and even though i did start off bad and was a little worried that i may not be around here too much its all about doing the job i started out bad but i still felt confident despite having the tough times
7846188 it was early on in the season and we started out rough
7846189 we put him in some rough situations early on but he just settled down because he was trying to do too much he pulled me aside one day and we literally played catch for about 40 minutes he started thinking too much and now hes just settled down trusting his stuff
7846190 the only real adjustment i made was to keep the ball down in the zone
7846191 if they elevate it then they can extend and drive it they can really damage you its tough but if i was going to have a respectable season i was going to have to keep the ball down and move it around rely on the ball to sink down and let the fielders do the work
7846192 obviously i feel more comfortable pitching to lefthanders than righties because i have the advantage i think but yeah i feel confident i can get righties out
7846193 when we saw him in spring training righties were like hes got some good stuff he keeps the ball down hes definitely very important to this pitching staff one thing about him hes always ready to go he really didnt care about that era he just wanted to help the team hes one of those guys who said rope im here to pitch man you like that kind of guy
7846194 in a winning situation you want to feel youre trusted and if it comes down to it im going to do the job sometimes it works out sometimes it doesnt its not always going to go your way overall i feel confident that i can do the job and i feel like i can
7846195 it began with me initially because im a huge consumer
7846196 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7846197 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7846198 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7846199 its embedded in our history now its part of our dna you cant take that away
7846200 they would be as successful today as they were in their own era because of their ability to adapt not only to their audiences but to the era they were playing in
7846201 they had a very unique ability to integrate themselves into any audience demographic
7846202 it really helps from on high to have somebody that you revere that you care about and want to hear what theyre saying and doing and what theyre wearing everything
7846203 thats important for us whether its an apparition or not
7846204 people are looking back now because were in a very similar situation to 68 an unpopular war an unpopular president whos waging it serious domestic problems
7846205 people ached to feel noble in 1968 and they ache to feel noble again
7846206 people sense theres a similarity between the two periods and it makes the kennedys more interesting to them
7846207 i dont think the american people know them very well
7846208 they do a lot of good humanitarian work but if i was to have to name them i think i would have a hard time
7846209 it is time again for a new generation of leadership it is time now for barack obama
7846210 i hope we can use this convention to help obamas campaign and his administration understand what millions of women in this country live everyday in terms of a lack of respect
7846211 good ol boy network that is still alive and well in the corporate world and in the political world
7846212 he could have been president if he had picked hillary how stupid can you be it seems like he did it to spite her
7846213 there was no thought that a woman could be an account executive
7846214 i think shes being pressured its disrespectful i think she was robbed
7846215 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7846216 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7846217 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7846218 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7846219 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7846220 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7846221 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7846222 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7846223 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7846224 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7846225 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life
7846226 hes been working all summer hes on the phone all the time
7846227 acknowledges responsibility for most of the mistakes and misjudgments that led to his early departure from the race saying he was cocky immature and naive about the demands of a presidential campaign
7846228 to demonstrate the staying power and the seriousness a lot of you reporters doubted that i have
7846229 they want to see if there is any interest there
7846230 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7846231 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7846232 i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen and itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can in the ways i know how its been making improvement theres no doubt about it
7846233 but its fine you get used to it its just the same as if youve been traded as a player
7846234 its a battle of the minds because i know his habits murray said
7846235 of course however its got to be the right situation i dont want to step into something thats already a bombshell
7846236 ive just got to go day to day right now
7846237 i just wanted to play you know thats what i came here for
7846238 he knows we didnt get him here for nothing we took infield he was out there throwing and said he was ready to play
7846239 we now anticipate that aggrekos performance for the year will exceed current market expectations

7846280 there have been many instances where the staff turned down an appeal and the reinstatement committee reversed it
7846281 while we would have appreciated a staff ruling that would have put him on the field tomorrow we are grateful for the opportunity to be heard on thursday
7846282 they told us that theyd get us a prompt ruling
7846283 what prompt means im not exactly sure they have done what theyve told us theyve been looking at it promptly while ben and i would have hoped for a better ruling from the staff were confident well get a fair and good hearing from the committee

7846296 the commissions obscuration of the ivir studies and its failure to confront the critical arguments made therein seem to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union
7846297 since their completion and publication both studies have attracted considerable attention in scholarly circles and among stakeholders and continue to play an important role in informing the current debate on the future of copyright law and policy in the eu
7846298 it comes therefore as a complete surprise to us to discover that our studies have been almost entirely ignored in the commissions so called forward looking package on intellectual property
7846299 amazingly and quite misleadingly the explanatory memorandum states that t here was no need for external expertise this is patently untrue as the terms of reference of the recasting study which were drawn up by the european commission expressly asked for the examination of among other issues the need for a term extension and the issue of co written musical works
7846300 we are of course well aware that several conclusions of the ivir studies do not agree with the policy choices underlying the commissions proposals and we are certainly not so na ve as to expect that the recommendations of an academic institution such as ours however well researched and conceived they may be will find their way into the commissions policies in undiluted form
7846301 what we would expect however is that our work which was expressly commissioned by the policy unit in charge of these proposals be given the appropriate consideration by the commission and be duly referenced in its policy documents in particular wherever the commissions policy choices depart from our studies main recommendations
7846302 based on the assumption that the world is male and makes the views or work of women invisible
7846303 this kind of thing really gets my goat its not as though anybody in their right mind would believe that the man in the street referred solely to the male sex its just stupid ive never heard anything like it
7846304 i think political correctness is one of the most ghastly things about our society its one of the most repulsive things ever to be invented
7846305 we introduced the guide because as community leaders we must be aware of what modern society requires of the public sector this includes the sensitivity of various individuals and groups and current thinking in society in general
7846306 it is easy to make fun of individual phrases or words but what we are seeking to do is to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of others in our society
7846307 i am very pleased that the experts at our conservation centre believe they can repair the shattered section of the tomb cover
7846308 whats sad is that due to vandals we will have to invest an estimated 2 000 in staff time and materials in undoing the damage
7846309 we also feel that it is wise to temporarily lock away the rest of the tomb cover to keep it safe from attack
7846310 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7846311 faceva parte della bugia amore mio non sono mai riuscito a cancellare lagonia il mio cuore non batteva da quasi novantanni ma stavolta andato diversamente non lo sentivo pi al suo posto cera un vuoto come se ti fossi portata via tutto ci che avevo dentro
7846312 la morte che libato il miele del tuo respiro nulla ha potuto ancora sulla tua bellezza
7846313 gt gt mormor e riconobbi i versi pronunciati da romeo sulla tomba di giulietta
7846314 non esattamente sono io stessa a darmi fastidio il mio volto cos facile da leggere mia madre dice sempre che sono un libro aperto
7846315 al contrario per me tu sei molto difficile da leggere
7846316 ho detto che sarebbe meglio che non diventassi amici non che non voglio
7846317 sarebbe pi prudente che tu non diventassi mia amica ma sono stanco di costringermi ad evitarti bella
7846318 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
7846319 credo che i tuoi amici siano arrabbiati con me perch ti ho rapita
7846320 no pi che altro sorpresa a cosa devo tutto questo
7846321 telho detto sono stanco di sforzarmi di starti lontano perci ci rinuncio
7846322 si rinuncio a sforzarmi di fare il bravo dora in poi far solo ci che mi va e mi prender quel che viene
7846323 e se non fossi il supereroe se fossi il cattivo
7846324 non dovresti trattare cos le persone non per niente corretto
7846325 abbacinarle in quel modo per fare colpo probabilmente corsa in cucina a cercare di riprendere fiato
7846326 e dai non dirmi che non ti rendi conto delleffetto che fai
7846327 non te ne sei accorto pensi che chiunque sia capace di fare quel che desidera cos facilmente
7846328 non ridere se te lo chiedo ma come fai a uscire di casa quando giorno
7846329 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7846330 sei davvero convinta di piacermi meno di quanto io piaccia a te
7846331 si mi vuoi rispondere o si ne sei davvero convinta
7846332 probabilmente no ma allultimo momento avrei cancellato linvito avrei finto una malattia o una caviglia slogata
7846333 immagino che tu non mi abbia mai visto in palestra ma pensavo che avresti capito
7846334 ti riferisci al fatto che non sei in grado di camminare su una superficie piana e solida senza inciampare
7846335 e il crepuscolo per noi il momento pi scuro della giornata lora pi leggera ma in un certo senso anche la pi triste la fine di un altro giorno il ritorno della notte loscurit fin troppo prevedibile non credi
7846336 a me la notte piace se non ci fosse il buio non vedremmo le stelle b non che qui si vedano un granch
7846337 avevo paura perch per ecco ovvi motivi non posso stare con te ma daltro canto vorrei stare con te molto molto pi del lecito
7846338 si non c dubbio una paura legittima voler stare con me e tutto fuorch una scelta vantaggiosa
7846339 avrei dovuto lasciarti perdere tempo fa dovrei lasciarti adesso ma non so se ci riuscirei
7846340 il che precisamente la migliore ragione per andarmene ma non preoccuparti sono una creatura troppo egoista desidero troppo la tua compagnia per comportarmi come dovrei
7846341 bella arriverei a odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male non hai idea di che tormento sia stato il pensiero di te immobile bianca fredda di non vederti pi avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo ora sei la cosa pi importante per me la cosa pi importante di tutta la mia vita
7846342 sai gi cosa provo ovviamente sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire piuttosto che rinunciare a te sono unidiota
7846343 sciocca correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
7846344 non prendertela con te stessa se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7846345 e domani sar pi difficile ora sono assuefatto alla presenza costante del tuo odore se ti resto lontano troppo a lungo mi toccher ricominciare da capo non proprio da zero per
7846346 stavi dormendo sodo non mi sono perso niente i discorsi li avevi gi fatti
7846347 ma cosa devo fare con te la prima volta che ti bacio mi assali la seconda mi svieni tra le braccia
7846348 a vedere una partita di baseball non mi sembra che tu abbia pi tanta voglia di giocare ma sono certa che gli altri si divertiranno anche senza di te
7846349 non sono mai arrabbiato con te come potrei esserlo sei sempre cos coraggiosa fiduciosa calorosa
7846350 ci che mi fa infuriare limpossibilit di proteggerti dai rischi la mia stessa presenza un rischio per te a volte mi odio dal profondo dovrei essere pi forte capace di
7846351 ti amo e una giustificazione banale per quanto faccio ma sincera
7846352 bella bella smettila ti preoccupi per le cose sbagliate credimi se ti dico che nessuno di noi rischia niente sei gi abbastanza sotto pressione non caricarti del peso di preoccupazioni superflue ascoltami la nostra famiglia forte lunica paura che abbiamo quella di perderti
7846353 edward rimasto solo per quasi un secolo ora ha trovato te dopo tutti questi anni passati assieme a lui certi cambiamenti non ci sfuggono e lui diverso adesso pensi che avremmo il coraggio di guardarlo in faccia per i prossimi centanni se ti perde
7846354 lo so bella credimi lo so e come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
7846355 ci credi se ti dico che malgrado tutto quello che ti sto facendo ti amo anche io
7846356 per aver rischiato di sparire dalla mia vita per sempre
7846357 non ce lho con billy e suo figlio a irritarmi
7846358 prima di tutto mi ha costretto a violare la mia promessa avevo promesso che stasera non ti avrei mollata neanche per un secondo
7846359 grazie ma c dellaltro ha detto che sei carina il che praticamente un insulto stasera sei molto pi che bellissima
7846360 di nuovo il crepuscolo unaltra fine ogni giorno deve finire anche il pi perfetto
7846361 non proprio pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
7846362 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
7846363 e allora preparati alla fine preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
7846364 se la vita ti offre un sogno che supera qualsiasi tua aspettativa non giusto lamentrasi perch alla fine si conclude
7846365 mentre li studiavo il pi giovane dei cullen alz lo sguardo e incroci il mio e stavolta la sua espressione era evidentemente incuriosita mi voltai di scatto e allora mi sembr di notare che il ragazzo fosse stranamente sorpeso quasi deluso
7846366 per un interminabile istante il silenzio fu assoluto poi iniziarono le urla in quel pandemonio sentivo gridare il mio nome dappertutto ma nitida in mezzo al frastuono vicina al mio orecchio udii la voce bassa e affannata di edward cullen
7846367 bevitori di sangue la tua gente li chiama vampiri hai la pelle doca
7846368 e sbagliato e rischio bella io sono pericoloso ti prego renditene conto
7846369 anchio te lho detto non mimporta cosa sei e troppo tardi
7846370 sedevo l il viso cinereo e gli occhi sbarrati un uccellino ipnotizzato dallo sguardo di un serpente
7846371 non avere paura prometto giuro che non ti far del male non avere paura per favore perdonami sono capace di controllarmi mi hai preso in contropiede ma adesso ar impeccabile
7846372 e stato a quel punto che hai rischiato di morire schiacciata nellincidente proprio sotto i miei occhi
7846373 si accucci con il volto appoggiato dolcemente al mio petto ascoltava il mio cuore gli sfugg un sospiro non so per quanto tempo restammo immobili in quella posizione ore intere per qul che mi sembrava sapevo che avrebbe potuto perdere il controllo in qualsiasi momento e la mia vita sarebbe finita l eppure non riuscivo a provare paura sentivo il contatto con lui e non pensavo ad altro
7846374 corsi alla finestra laprii e mi sporsi nelloscurit della sera a scrutare le ombre impernetrabili degli alberi
7846375 dammi solo un minuto per rimettere in moto il cuore
7846376 incrociammo i nostri sguardi attenti la sua espressione si fece pi rilassata ma allo stesso tempo perplessa
7846377 e poi nel sonno ti ho sentita pronuinciare il mio nome tanto chiaramente da farmi credere che ti fossi svegliata ti sei rigirata nel letto hai mormorato di nuovo il mio nome e sospirato quel momento mi ha sbolrdito e segnato ho capito che non avrei pi potuto ignorarti
7846378 non mi sembra affatto giusto io non ho dovuto aspettare nemmeno un seccondo perch dovrebbe andarmi cos liscia
7846379 hai ragione dopotutto sei soltanto costretta a rischiare la vita ogni secondo che passi assiaeme a me e non un granch ti tocca soltanto voltare le spalle alla natura allumanit cosa vuoi che sia
7846380 pochissimo non mi sembra di dover sopportare una gran rinuncia
7846381 e sei preoccupata non perch stai per conoscere una famiglia di vampiri ma perch temi che questi vampiri non ti approveranno giusto
7846382 la musica rallent si trasform in qualcosa di pi morbido e con grande sorpresa
7846383 vuoi che blocchi le uscite cos potete massacrare gli ignari cittadini
7846384 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7846385 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare

7846389 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7846390 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7846391 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7846392 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the taliban to step up their war on pakistan
7846393 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso

7846406 to remain uninvolved in every way in matters involving the termination of the general manager
7846407 had worked very very closely with gil olivares and the board has felt for some time that he has been more interested in representing mr olivares and we dont want him involved in this process
7846408 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
7846409 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
7846410 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
7846411 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
7846412 out in the open with his cattle and his horses
7846413 there were some serious disagreements in their family but he was always one who stuck in there and helped to make the sale of the land
7846414 i think john small was a man of few words but of bold actions
7846415 he had a big heart for his family and the city and he continued to devote his time for all those causes up until the end of his life
7846416 we have many many people who have been flooded and weve had lots of structural damage
7846417 while it may now be legal for a prosecutor to carry a licensed concealed handgun in a courtroom i retain significant concerns with regard to the level of training that should be required in order to permit prosecutors to safely carry firearms in the volatile environment of a criminal courthouse
7846418 a disgruntled court participant might attempt to seize control of a weapon in order to effect an escape or harm other individuals
7846419 who have demonstrated a high level of proficiency to a certified firearms instructor on my staff

7846426 we will target latinos in 20 states because latinos are not just in a few key states they are throughout the country
7846427 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward
7846428 the players know that if he has to fly over to taiwan to get something made he doesnt care hell do it if he has to bring in a nike guy to get the shoes right custom shoes or whatever hell get it done
7846429 the players have to know the equipment guy is doing everything possible to put them in a good position so they can go out and play 100 m p h
7846430 it starts with your owner for both of those guys equipment manager and trainer from the day we got here our owner said we want it first class and we want it done the right way and that allows those guys to do that they dont shortchange anything so they can go out and get the best equipment for them thats a huge thing
7846431 you know its going to be a physical contest so i know im going to be getting off the floor a lot slower playing with the kids
7846432 theres not going to be too much physical conduct in the household as far as playing with the kids or roughhousing because i know im going to be beat up after those games i know

7846435 i go from the small to the large the part to the whole
7846436 the individual meeting with the coordinators maybe two or three guys then to the whole group the offense defense special teams then everybody together you feel like youre going from one meeting to another at times but thats good it keeps people organized and on the same page
7846437 if you get in here by about 8 in the morning you can be out of here by noon and the rest of the day is yours
7846438 sometimes i do appearances but if im not really doing anything ill do whatever errands i have to do because you really dont have much time to do them the rest of the week
7846439 i try to be a handyman but usually ill make things worse then ill call the plumber something like that but for the most part im just watching sports on television
7846440 i look for what they like to do on first second and third down ill just put the tape in and look at all first down passes first and second down runs third down nickel stuff
7846441 everything has to be done for the players by tuesday night
7846442 they all get a book of the game plan it shows the opponents pass plays and runs its a pretty good sized book and it takes a little time to put that together meantime the offensive coaches are off doing their own thing
7846443 we could go until about 11 oclock its like getting ready for a final exam every week you want to have as much knowledge as you can so we try to get everything fed to the players on wednesday
7846444 it all depends what works for you like just talking on the phone with your loved ones or like just paying bills thatll get your mind off it
7846445 i dont have a lot of physical demands in this game but the mental part wears on you
7846446 my wife says im like a woman with pms the last two months of the season it kind of builds up as the year goes on so i need those stress release days to not think about stuff it kind of builds back up wednesday thursday friday and saturday then im pretty revved up on sunday so on tuesday i try not to come in at all if possible i dont have to watch film

7846449 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7846450 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7846451 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent

7846457 after the apostles james the brother of the lord surnamed the just was made head of the church at jerusalem many indeed are called james
7846458 thats one heck of a subtle jew who can pick up on all the sophisticated temple priestly imagery of luke chapters one and two
7846459 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others i am delighted that the church of england now has this helpful guide which will prove invaluable for those wanting to plan their own services and for all those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7846460 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with all that lives
7846461 be dedicated to prayer for the protection of creation and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles that reverse our contribution to climate change
7846462 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7846463 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7846464 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7846465 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7846466 through secondary schooling derrick was always in the bottom sets as black pupils were not allowed to be in the top sets at that time he always wanted to be a male nurse but he came to realise that he could not cope with the hospital environment he changed direction and went to university but he was thrown out after a year and trained as an electrician in applying for an electrician post with wolverhampton borough council he was offered a job as an officer
7846467 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7846468 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7846469 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7846470 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7846471 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7846472 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7846473 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7846474 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7846475 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7846476 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7846477 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7846478 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7846479 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7846480 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7846481 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7846482 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7846483 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7846484 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7846485 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7846486 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7846487 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7846488 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7846489 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7846490 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7846491 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7846492 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7846493 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7846494 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7846495 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7846496 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7846497 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
7846498 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit
7846499 you can go out and hit somebody but if you dont hit them the right way and have good leverage
7846500 this is my first week practicing there itd be like looking at the team after a week of training camp you dont expect the team to be perfect at that point but you expect them to be making improvement toward what you want them to be
7846501 i dont feel completely comfortable but im getting more comfortable every day i feel like im making real improvement every day
7846502 im going to do everything you ask me to do go as hard as i possibly can but the fact is its not going to be perfect right now theres still things i need to work on
7846503 jason is a pretty good fullback there i think he has some skill and ability and then tony is progressing and he has to do that very quickly here and then jed has had a fine training camp as well and had a couple of shots there early well certainly go back and review that as well
7846504 it is important to chris well have to see day by day i dont know how hard he can go but he needs to get out there and he needs to practice
7846505 im not going to get into numbers and how many were going to keep and all that
7846506 its probably one of the things were going to have to decide after the game no question

7846514 i debatten pratas ocks om brottsmisstanke som villkor f r spaning men det r ett krav som normalt h r ihop med polisens olika tv ngsmedel och inget som europadomstolen kr vt i tidigare domar om signalspaning
7846515 det r om jligt att inf ra begreppet brottsmisstanke i fra lagen
7846516 regeringen och fra har mycket sv rt att hantera kravet p brottsmisstanke eftersom det om jligg r filtrering och behandling av all kabeltrafik som passerar landets gr nser dvs fundamentet f r fra lagen kravet kortsluter fra lagen och det s tt p vilket fra vill arbeta utrymmet f r kompromiss dvs att infoga kravet p brottsmisstanke och domstolsbeslut i den antagna fra lagen r obefintligt
7846517 kraven om brottsmisstanke och domstolsbeslut r inte f renliga med fundamenten i fra lagen d rf r b r den antagna lagen rivas upp med omstart d r arbetet sker i en bred parlamentarisk kommitt
7846518 i signalspaning som riktas mot en enskild person ska kr vas n gon form av brottsmisstanke vid spaning mot fysiska personer r misstankar om brott den naturliga utg ngspunkten
7846519 ett krav p brottsmisstanke avvisas av moderaten och f rsvarsministern sten tolgfors f rslaget om brottsmisstanke r speciellt d rf r att det inte g r att ha brottsmisstanke n r det handlar om andra l nders agerande eller internationella terrororganisationer h r handlar det om att skydda sverige mot hot och vi vill aldrig att de ska uppkomma de ska aldrig f rverkligas s just den delen tror jag r sv r just n r det g ller brottsmisstanken s ger sten tolgfors
7846520 n gra tidigare partiledare dussinet moderata kommunpolitiker en sj lvutn mnd borgerlig grupp f r att stoppa fra lagen och nu senast thomas bodstr m har alla i dn givit uttryck f r uppfattningen att lagstiftningen m ste ndras s att signalspaning bara f r bedrivas i de fall d r det finns en brottsmisstanke men jag r ledsen d har de inte f rst tt n gonting

7846523 den antagna lagen ska rivas upp med omstart d r arbetet sker i en bred parlamentarisk kommitt
7846524 det rimliga nu r att ta ett ordenligt grepp och b rja om fr n b rjan med en parlamentarisk utredning
7846525 fredrik reinfeldt t nker inte riva upp fra lagen men r ppen f r f rslag p f rb ttringar
7846526 regeringen r ppen f r f rslag p f rb ttringar och v lkomnar f rslaget fr n centrum f r r ttvisa
7846527 regeringen r ppen f r f rslag p f rb ttringar och v lkomnar f rslaget

7846537 making sure you are on tv heard on radio have a presence on the streets things like that are important and we have done a couple of concerts holding a concert was a big deal because apart from it being the first time any movie has done a concert with the cast it gave a great platform for us to interact directly with the audience of the movie
7846538 we have been so authentic about our presentation on the film and we have used that to tell the people that this is what you are going to get when you go to the theatre and thats what people want to see
7846539 before we shot the film there was a whole look test that they did and everyone had different ideas about the way they wanted to look i too had my mind set on certain things and i think if kd his character didnt have that look the band wouldnt look that good the beard adds so much to my character

7846555 el estado debe continuar como propietario exclusivo de petr leos mexicanos pemex de ninguna manera se debe privatizar
7846556 estamos culminando una etapa que se inici por la lucha para abrir los espacios de debate y discusi n en este senado
7846557 la nica de las iniciativas que se encuentra en el congreso y tiene el respaldo y el consenso de intelectuales acad micos y expertos es precisamente la del fap
7846558 lleg la hora del dictamen del congreso no habr ley beltrones ni ley calder n sino la ley del congreso
7846559 no est en contra de que la iniciativa privada participe
7846560 no queremos salga de las reas de pemex en las que est apoyando
7846561 sin duda hay consenso de que urge una radical transformaci n de pemex sin embargo las visiones son distintas
7846562 un pemex con ductos y refiner as propone de entrada la construcci n de cuando menos tres propiedad todo de la naci n sin contratos de riesgo ni de servicios m ltiples ni abiertos ni disfrazados con una estructura integrada con capacidades de gesti n y con recursos suficientes para su actualizaci n permanente y su crecimiento con mecanismos de supervisi n y control internos y externos adecuados y con un sindicato democr tico digno de la calidad de los trabajadores petroleros que atienda las funciones esenciales de la organizaci n sindical que hoy m s que velar por los leg timos derechos de los trabajadores por conveniencia de y por conveniencia de la administraci n federal en turno cuida sus parcelas de poder pol tico y econ mico lo que estimula la corrupci n y la ineficiencia
7846563 en suma un pemex nuestro no por un nacionalismo trasnochado ni por chovinismo sino por la conciencia de la importancia del petr leo en el contexto geopol tico mundial por nuestra vecindad geogr fica por el tr nsito ampliamente documentado de nuestra historia por la trascendencia de nuestra seguridad energ tica como elemento sustantivo de seguridad nacional y por ende de nuestra soberan a
7846564 pemex no s lo puede cumplir cabal y ampliamente con esta tarea fundamental como se ha demostrado en m ltiples ocasiones sino que debe hacerlo por el mandato irrenunciable que deriva de la constituci n
7846565 la seguridad energ tica del pa s requiere una pol tica de estado definida en funci n de los intereses nacionales que considere la transici n energ tica y al petr leo como un recurso no renovable de amplio uso econ mico por ello en las condiciones del pa s una pol tica energ tica de estado es inseparable de la construcci n de un nuevo paradigma de desarrollo econ mico energ tico y ecol gico una propuesta que s lo busca reformar pemex es notoriamente insuficiente e inadecuada m s a n cuando persigue instaurar las condiciones para que capitales privados constituyan corporaciones que se beneficien del crudo y de las labores de exploraci n y extracci n de hidrocarburos en especial en algunas zonas del pa s y sobre todo del golfo de m xico la soberan a energ tica es un asunto estrat gico de seguridad nacional

7846571 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7846572 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7846573 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions

7846714 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
7846715 it is apparent that euro dollar is becoming more sensitive to downside surprises in eurozone economic data than us negative surprises
7846716 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7846717 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7846718 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions

7846727 like most light emission sources nanotubes emit light in all directions their spectrum was relatively broad and their efficiency was not very high
7846728 we attacked all these problems making its light directional so it can be coupled to optical filters or to a device to transport it we controlled its spectrum with an optical cavity and we have proposed a theory to help us achieve higher efficiency
7846729 we confined the emission in an optical cavity with two mirrors so that light forms a standing wave between the mirrors which enhanced the frequencies whose wavelength were equal to half the size of the cavity
7846730 we used lithography to form the cavities which achieved a dramatic enhancement confining the spectrum to about 10 percent of what it was without the cavity and giving us an overall enhancement in the efficiency of the emission of 400 percent

7846749 after the first few games we needed to come down here and put on a real workman like performance and be strong at the back and to be fair it wasnt just at the back the whole team defended really well
7846750 we frustrated crystal palace in the first half which we wanted to do
7846751 it wasnt pretty football from us probably but after the last couple of weeks we needed just to get a foot on the ladder and we did that
7846752 coming to crystal palace youre not going to boss the game for 90 minutes so the plan was to frustrate them first and get our way into the game
7846753 coming off at half time at 0 0 and hearing the home crowd booing was music to our ears because its been a little bit different for the last couple of weeks
7846754 so it gave us a platform to go on from there
7846755 the way the second half went we needed to score we wanted the three points but wed have taken a point and a clean sheet before the game
7846756 i caught the volley quite well it just happened to be straight down the keepers throat
7846757 we had quite a few shots and near misses especially in the second half you just need a bit of a break maybe a deflection or maybe not hit it so well and it goes in the bottom corner anything like that but were happy with a clean sheet and a point that gets us on the board and hopefully we can build on that
7846758 we had a little bit of a change of mentality from the previous two games we didnt go straight out to win the game from minute one and i think that saw us well into half time
7846759 i dont think wed been troubled that much there was a little bit of pressure but no actual clear cut chances that gave us confidence in the second half obviously the game changed when they went down to 10 and nine men but were happy with what we got
7846760 i would have a hard time telling you when john mccain has ever stepped forward to help us on rural issues

7846792 in the first leg match schalke played a very good opening 15 minutes we on the other hand possessed the ball but we werent convincing this wednesday we have to play more vertically and push forward without thinking twice we have to create plays and finish them off

7846907 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed

7847277 at the heart of our work is a core of actors who have worked and trained together to develop a common vocabulary and approach to the work focused on language clarity and good storytelling
7847278 it is very stimulating for the actors they have three roles to remember as opposed to one on the other hand you never get bored it is also true that because you have 30 actors spread over 5 plays the person playing a small walk on one night may be playing the lead the next you get a kind of consistency of talent throughout the company that is harder to match when you have one show at a time
7847279 there is a risk of it being cold or rainy we perform in light rain and have done so very successfully our audiences stay with us on the other hand there is nothing quite like watching a shakespearean production such as a midsummer nights dream under a moon the feeling that 400 years ago under that very moon another audience watched this play theres a sense of interaction the whippoorwills being a part of it we can use the forest the trees and the woods behind our stage as a kind of cyclorama there are many many plusses and most people agree this is an extraordinary place to watch a play
7847280 it was purely academic i didnt know very much about the theatre but at 15 or 16 i was assigned to study hamlet and ill never forget being so excited by it then once i started in college placement courses i was taken off to see plays and became so fascinated with shakespeare in particular that i remember saying i want to be an actor even though i had never been onstage or knew anything about it i soon learned i wasnt going to be an actor but the bug bites deeply
7847281 theres a surprising number of young people in our audiences and so often we hear that they first came here as part of a high school group and wanted to come back after they left school we follow up with workshops for the school groups to make it more than just attending a performance we bring in actors to talk about how you do shakespeare and their relationship with shakespeare and these plays and its often a very exciting part of the process too
7847282 its a terrific place for a couple to take a long weekend or some days off september is a lovely time to be here too its cooler and the leaves are beginning to change its a very special trip for theatre lovers who like to go to festival theatre and an equal attraction to a really lovely place to visit
7847283 we are in the process of raising funds to build our first indoor space and im pretty confident that its going to be open next summer we have the foundations in already and were in the final stages of raising the funds to complete it ive always thought apt and spring green were destined hopefully not too far into the future to become a major attraction for theatre lovers throughout the upper midwest as well as for the beauty of the countryside and the charm of the little village i think this area has enormous potential and already word is spreading
7847284 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7847285 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7847286 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again

7847298 there are a lot of opportunities in the residential buy to let sector mainly the development of new villas and apartments to be rented out to locals

7847300 the properties are then owned freehold a company can be set up for around 1 200 without traveling to romania
7847301 good local knowledge is essential land registry documents must be very carefully checked as about 70 percent of land in romania is still not properly registered

7847313 while the asset sale program will provide the group with liquidity and some level of debt reduction the group considers that asset sales alone will not provide a long term recapitalization solution
7847314 no proposal received to date provides an acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of relevant stakeholders
7847315 at one point we didnt know what we were going to do we were going to get arrested or maced

7847323 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar sino jugar bien
7847324 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7847325 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar

7847334 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
7847335 ill go read google news ill go read guardian uk go read our web site and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
7847336 just when you see the most outlandish clip you could ever see somebody introduces something new i just check in periodically just to see how far porn has gone in my absence
7847337 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
7847338 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon

7847344 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7847345 if youre catholic and you disagree with your church what do you do you change your mind
7847346 recreate 68 march with little success yeah there are a number of chuckleheads in the crowd but the reporters insistence that refusing to talk to him is tantamount to not believing in freedom of speech is about the most stupid thing ive ever heard
7847347 im obviously pleased with the result i thought l played a good solid match and am just pleased to be through to the next round
7847348 shes not to be underestimated even though im ranked higher than her
7847349 i understand an offer has been made but neither club has as yet confirmed that or spoken with me
7847350 a number of premier league clubs have asked about ali and there is no shortage of interest so news of a bid is not at all surprising
7847351 it is now up to bolton but we would hope that they would allow ali the chance to move on
7847352 unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points

7847354 i wish i had a stronger squad to take down there and i wish i could just rest one or two players who need it
7847355 but i wont be able to do that i have just got to pick the very best team i can we havent got those riches yet because of injuries
7847356 its a very busy time and im looking to bring in another two maybe three players
7847357 its not easy there are so many players at your disposal that its hard to get the right one i dont want to just throw money away
7847358 when youre in the premiership you do get linked to so many players but at the end of the day we will see what happens this week
7847359 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so expletive smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what expletive dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

7847368 there will be huge falls in the amount of crops that you can grow because there isnt the rain and its too hot
7847369 the only gleam of hope and i cannot underrate it is from confidence in god when i look upward it calms any apprehension for the future and i seem to hear a voice saying if i clothe the lilies of the field shall i not also clothe you here is my strong confidence and i will wait patiently for the direction of providence

7847376 oorspronkelijk was de vraagprijs 3 miljoen euro een prijs die volgens experten niet overdreven was maar we hebben onderhandeld en betaalden uiteindelijk 2 8 miljoen euro
7847377 het is geen koopje maar het schilderij is zijn prijs zeker waard

7847391 dorian troppo saggio per non fare delle sciocchezze ogni tanto
7847392 la vita troppo breve perch ci si possa caricare anche degli errori degli altri ogni uomo vive la propria vita e paga il suo prezzo per questo peccato soltanto che si debba pagare cos spesso per un solo errore
7847393 sono le passioni sulla cui origine noi ci inganniamo quelle che ci tiranneggiano maggiormente i nostri impulsi pi deboli sono quelli la cui natura pi chiara spesso accade che quando pensiamo di fare esperimenti sugli altri stiamo in realt facendo esperimenti su noi stessi

7847522 i want you to show me how much you dont want to be locked in a cell with a bunch of criminals overnight
7847523 and if you dont want to learn exactly what kind of hell that would be i suggest you begin immediately
7847524 to be on the safe side if there still was such a thing
7847525 there are quite a few things youve forgotten mr uchiha
7847526 just answer the questions and we wont have any trouble got it
7847527 you asked for my number and let me off with a warning
7847528 you tricked me into a bar and got me drunk
7847529 and do you remember what you told me that night
7847530 do you remember when that bad accident happened a couple of years ago the one lee and i were in
7847531 we were called into that major car chase that had been all over the city and then pushed out onto the highway
7847532 did i ever tell you how id sprained my ankle that morning before anything happened
7847533 well i did stupid really tripped at a suspects house as we were leaving
7847534 well because my ankle hurt lee insisted on driving back into the city usually im the driver because lee keeps the notes while we talk about a case but before we made it back we got the call to intercept the chase on the highway
7847535 if that chrysler hadnt merged onto the highway right in front of us the accident never would have happened lee saw it and tried to correct but it was too late nobody could have avoided it the car hit us and we spun and lee was crushed in the drivers seat and almost died i was banged up but nothing serious with lee in critical condition my sprained ankle was hardly anyones concern
7847536 the driver of the chrysler was unconscious but the foreign diplomat he was driving made it without a scratch and hes now one of lees closest friends gaara and because lee was in the hospital for so long he saw a lot of a particular nurse and now sakuras his wife so it wasnt all bad if you look at it that way
7847537 is that it should have been me behind the wheel it should have been me who almost died it should have been me in that hospital not knowing if surgery would allow me to continue to live a normal life or not but it wasnt me it was lee in the drivers seat that time a total coincidence those are the dangers all of us on the force have to face to do our jobs we never know when someones going to pull a gun or a knife or set off a bomb and blow up a building we never know
7847538 i love you so much sasuke dont push me away dont make me face it all alone i need you too
7847539 if you wait twenty minutes before leaving ill have dinner when you get home
7847540 i saw mr ling in the lobby on his way out
7847541 er do you want to eat in here or in the dining room
7847542 i got all your favorites i got chicken and snow peas and orange beef and shrimp lo mein
7847543 i can make the table real quick if you give me one second
7847544 sasuke interrupted holding up narutos cell phone in evidence before tossing it away from them onto the floor
7847545 i know what day it is and ive already spoken to lee tenten and neji so you dont have to worry about anything now be quiet and go to sleep
7847546 i told them you had acute gastritis from some spoiled milk and that youd probably be fine by tomorrow
7847547 for your information naruto while you seem to be in perfect condition i can hardly move
7847548 i called myself out sick from work today too so just quit arguing and be quiet and let me lie here until i feel like having you make me some waffles or something okay
7847549 theyd ended up taking a taxi to narutos place and spending the next day and a half in bed and for the first time in his life sasuke had found he couldnt shut up
7847550 narutos true feelings could be heard in the way he repeated sasukes name swelling sasukes heart so painfully that the tears came after all quiet streams that dampened his cheeks where long sections of his hair hid them
7847551 so just quit arguing and be quiet and let me lie here until i feel like having you make me some waffles or something okay
7847552 for those who dont believe in themselves hard work is useless
7847553 flakes made from fragments struck from a larger stone core
7847554 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7847555 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7847556 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7847557 thus during hard times and resource droughts these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members on the same team

7847566 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat

7847616 a est tua tinha falhas irrevers veis tecnicamente era imposs vel de reformar
7847617 depois da inaugura o da est tua por coincid ncia ou n o o palmeiras montou um time fant stico e voltou a ganhar tudo
7847618 vou trabalhar por isso n o vamos abrir m o dessa homenagem
7847619 eu tenho convic o de que o marcos vai se aposentar no palmeiras principalmente pela dignidade que possui tenho certeza que ele ter sua homenagem n o tenha d vida disso
7847620 a torcida tem muito carinho por ele e o marcos defendeu o palmeiras durante muitos anos acredito realmente que ele merece ganhar uma est tua
7847621 acho importante que ele se interesse conhe a a pessoa que vai fazer e veja como est a obra pelo menos a cada 15 dias para ajudar com as suas opini es

7847642 now you have to be really concerned that you build enough confidence its a fragile program from that sense

7847891 after reading this post it seems to me like that 13 y o kid has a higher maturity level than you gary
7847892 josh has been personally very helpful to me over the past few months not just with the stuff in his blog but personally showing me around the warrior forum helping me out with article marketing and giving me some ideas for newsletters
7847893 if i read your post correctly it seemed to suggest that the content wasn t written by a 13 now 14 year old and that it was fake that s a pretty harsh accusation to make
7847894 the traffic isnt great at all it is only about 30 uniques a day quite a bit different than the 8 000 a month i was expecting i was really hoping some of the rss subscribers would be more involved i really have to figure out how to promote this thing
7847895 in fact the mmo niche mostly bores me all the a listers are being removed from my reader when i do a clean up and i will be following some newbies in the niche to see if they can give a fresh opinion and actually help me
7847896 what confuses me is that caroline is one of the nicest most transparent people i have met in im
7847897 unfortunately i don t want to start a comment war but i like bob he s a good guy enough said
7847898 caroline middlebrook is one of my favorite bloggers right after you garry
7847899 caroline is a good person who is doing extremely well in this industry for the short amount of time she s been online anyone who would disrespect that and make up lies about her has serious issues
7847900 i believe the best thing to do with trash like this is to just ignore it sending it exposure is only going to send more people who like to watch it
7847901 it s a little ironic that the scammer that sold me the blog purchased a foot note ad for this post
7847902 i did a whois on his blog looks like he also owns bloggingzoom which did decent so he may have some credibility in the blogosphere
7847903 i understand that you are trying to get back readership and had to attack me so its ok good marketing tactic
7847904 vic this isn t an attack this is our opinion of the way you ve cracked down on a newbie don t try to make this about us as if we re using it as a marketing tactic
7847905 i wouldnt sell that is what i think that is only 11 months of income plus each month your blog gets more so youre losing big time i think it would be stupid to sell a blog that is making 3500 dollars per month unless you see it going under
7847906 yourownripoffblog is only 400 and i will personally install it via our advanced interwebbie system and if you buy now ill even throw in my special offer a free blog widget pack normally valued at over 700 you get this free gives you access the mega entrecard network advanced technology shows your latest and i mean the most recent blog posts and it even gives you a free 428 428 yourownripoffblog banner at the top of your blog
7847907 thanks garry looks like this has brought out your true colors
7847908 i m not going to defend myself from your latest comment the im conversation we had was nearly 1 5 months ago i was bored with the whole mmo niche because of exactly this
7847909 i ll be happy to provide you with proof that the blog is making an average of 2 500 per month as we speak due to lack of interest i have let it slip in the last few months
7847910 and if me not wanting to pay you 1 500 for running my blog for me makes me a liar in your opinion so be it
7847911 you can talk yourself up as much as you want on here by saying you feel totally accountable and responsible for helping every single person who reads your blog but in the end you re in it for the money which was quite obvious when you proposed to blog for me at a rate of 1 500 you saw an opportunity and tried to go for it
7847912 i m very disappointed in your reaction the word hypocrite comes to mind
7847913 i guess this means you no longer want to play nice and be friends so i was going to ask you to remove me from your blogroll
7847914 vic talks about helping people but he did not try to help caroline he could have sent her a nice email and suggested she remove the links he did not like or change the title of her book or whatever
7847915 tell you what vic why don t you send your 70 or so mindless vic train riders over to my blog instead it would be much more fun for me
7847916 i am very puzzled why you have sunk so low here and used the extremely fowl language you have in this post
7847917 you know deep down in your heart that you envy what these two bloggers have and are trying any way you can to get there
7847918 you re here for the hype like any other marketing tactic
7847919 i guess i am one of the mindless riders you are referring to what do you want
7847920 josh your head is stuck so far up garry s ass i don t think you know a sheep from a wolf
7847921 the whole reason a blog has comments is to strike up conversation and many time controversy
7847922 it looks like vic sent a few of his sheep over re above comments man what an ordeal
7847923 i really have to figure out to promote this thing
7847924 screw the post i just want to read the comments
7847925 the donations in the past couple of days have demonstrated that people really care about the future of telford tigers

7847932 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7847933 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7847934 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7847935 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7847936 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike

7847961 i had always planned to work for a nonprofit doing something to help others but i never felt i was efficient or empathetic enough because i had not walked in the shoes of those i served now through my illness ministry and books on aspects of coping with illness i have the chance to use what i experience each day to reach out to others its my hope that they will also find hope despite their illness as they discover that new sense of purpose in the pain

7847997 energy storage and powers caes technology is poised to become an important part of the dispatch stack that can address the intermittency of renewables and reduce on peak power costs
7847998 our company examined the technology for its own use and decided that the potential was great enough that we wanted a larger role in helping to make compressed air energy storage a technology that is broadly embraced by the electricity sector we believe this technology is an important component of a broad effort to combat climate change an effort that must includes increased conservation expanded renewable energy and new clean central power
7847999 pseg has the expertise and financial resources to bring this technology out of the development stage and into the deployment stage we have learned a lot since building the mcintosh plant in alabama and i believe the time is right technically environmentally and economically for a large scale deployment of es amp ps caes technology
7848000 the technology has evolved to the point where it can be critical to helping this nation meet its growing energy needs while helping decrease carbon emissions from the electricity sector
7848001 we see strong market potential for caes in the traditional power industry as well as for the growing renewable energy industry
7848002 energy storage is the missing piece of the puzzle for a green affordable and reliable electric grid for the 21st century caes units can manage wind output to create a highly valuable firm dispatchable product even independent of wind it can be a cost effective intermediate generation source for energy arbitrage capacity and ancillary services i am very excited to launch this initiative with dr nakhamkin and look forward to working with him as we grow this business
7848003 clearly compressed air energy storage has significant potential as a near term viable large scale energy storage technology
7848004 as we see greater and more widespread integration of intermittent generation such as wind gain acceptance storage technologies like caes will become even more vital we look forward to working with pseg and other industry players in helping to accelerate the development and deployment of caes plant technology with both above ground and underground reservoirs for the storage of compressed air as an essential next step in advancing a cleaner and more environmentally sound energy future

7848071 once you have the energy and transmission there are any number of clever things you can do
7848072 the massive size and financial wherewithal enjoyed by iberdrola was often touted as a benefit for consumers and public policy but in response again to questioning by the department staff the iberdrola witnesses could not or would not offer anything concrete as assurance that this claimed benefit would in fact be of any benefit at all

7848114 but he also recognises that the crisis period for northern ireland has passed and that the people of northern ireland are now in charge of their own destiny
7848115 he will consult with the taoiseach the british prime minister and party leaders in northern ireland to determine whether a special us envoy for northern ireland continues to be necessary or whether a senior administration official serving as point person for northern ireland would be most effective
7848116 as president barack obama will personally engage on irish issues whenever necessary
7848117 barack obama will continue the tradition of welcoming the irish prime minister to the white house on st patricks day and he intends to visit ireland as president
7848118 they wont let it go at this stage the reality is that the irish american vote now while it is sizeable it is also significant beyond its size
7848119 when ministers were appointed they made public and legally binding pledges which are not being fulfilled
7848120 this cannot continue a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for september 18
7848121 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
7848122 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7848123 when sinn f in changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7848124 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7848125 let me make it clear the dup will not respond to threats such as that which sinn f in has made
7848126 if we were to do so on this issue we would be vulnerable to having the republican threat of bringing the institutions down used again and again in order that we would comply with other sinn f in demands
7848127 nor indeed will we make political concessions in order to encourage any party to do that which it pledged to do and carry out duties which it is legally required to perform
7848128 let me deal with the inaccurate propaganda which is being disseminated by republicans about policing and justice the st andrews agreement between the government and the government of the republic of ireland neither bound nor required the dup to accept the devolution of policing and justice nor did it impose any timetable for such devolution
7848129 for some time i have sought to have the executive called together to deal with important outstanding business
7848130 i have cleared executive papers in order for business to be presented to ministers indeed i have approved sufficient work for several executive meetings
7848131 that half of the year well well never be friends
7848132 tranquilla o andr tutto bene e cmq sia io ci sar xte
7848133 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7848134 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7848135 in the end of the day the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7848136 use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7848137 will continue our efforts to reach a historic agreement before the end of the bush administration
7848138 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed
7848139 then wash my hands and head as well lord not just my feet

7848154 rivaldo wil weg maar in tegenstelling tot wat hij zegt blijft hij tot het einde van het seizoen onder contract bij aek n hij zal alleen vertrekken als de club een vervanger heeft gevonden
7848155 het is een kwalijke zaak dat talenten zo kunnen vertrekken
7848156 je moet ook de achtergronden kennen van die transfers de trainers van arsenal en liverpool kenden de spelers niet eens ze hebben ze nooit gezien heel zorgelijk en het geeft een naar gevoel als je grootste talenten verdwijnen
7848157 we hebben heel veel jeugdtrainers in dienst fysiotherapeuten begeleiders allemaal om die jongens beter te maken
7848158 we willen de besten laten doorstromen naar het eerste daarmee kunnen we ons onderscheiden van andere nederlandse clubs tegelijkertijd krijg je met eigen spelers meer binding met de regio
7848159 we moeten creatief gaan nadenken hoe we die jongens beter kunnen binden

7848172 det vigtigste budskab her er at vi har haft en rigtig god performance i vores forsikringsforretning en lav combined ratio og en god udvikling p alle punkter og det vi kan se nu er at bytteforholdet til de andre forsikringsselskaber er begyndt at vende som f lge af alle de konkurrencem ssige tiltag vi har foretaget

7848184 you will indeed drink from my bitter cup but i have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left my father has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen
7848185 you know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people and officials flaunt their authority over those under them 26 but among you it will be different whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant 27 and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave 28 for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many
7848186 the teachers of religious law and the pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of moses
7848187 everything they do is for show on their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with scripture verses inside and they wear robes with extra long tassels
7848188 dont let anyone call you rabbi for you have only one teacher and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters
7848189 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in peoples faces you wont go in yourselves and you dont let others enter either
7848190 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you cross land and sea to make one convert and then you turn that person into twice the child of hell you yourselves are
7848191 blind guides what sorrow awaits you for you say that it means nothing to swear by gods temple but that it is binding to swear by the gold in the temple
7848192 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees
7848193 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish but inside you are filthy full of greed and self indulgence
7848194 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead peoples bones and all sorts of impurity
7848195 what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed and you decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors destroyed
7848196 but in saying that you testify against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets
7848197 therefore i am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers of religious law but you will kill some by crucifixion and you will flog others with whips in your synagogues chasing them from city to city
7848198 tell them thank you and they are in my prayers

7848220 aber das kostet alle kassen im n chsten jahr unter morbi rsa gesichtspunkten echtes geld denn dieser sieht eine zuteilung an finanzmitteln nur f r bestimmte und eindeutig benannte erkrankungsbilder vor die aktuelle lage zeigt aber dass wir unter den derzeitigen umst nden keinen cent aus dem rsa topf sehen w rden

7848225 mohammad i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and during the course of the incident he has fallen and struck his head on the pavement sustaining serious head injuries
7848226 the questions we need to answer are was he assaulted was he punched or pushed did he fall and try and find the exact circumstances of how it came to be
7848227 clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to young mohammad
7848228 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7848229 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7848230 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7848231 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street
7848232 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head

7848240 mijn vriend toen ik jou vroeg om iets voor mij te doen en jij wilde dat zij ik tegen jou dat je met al je kracht tegen de rots moest duwen en dat heb je gedaan ik heb nooit gezegd dat ik verwachtte dat je de rots zou verplaatsen je taak was duwen en nu kom je uitgeput naar me toe en denk je dat je hebt gefaald je armen en je rug zijn sterk en gespierd je hebt eelt op je handen je benen zijn sterk ondanks de tegenslagen ben je wijzer geworden en je kunt nu meer dan ooit het is waar dat je de rots niet hebt verplaatst maar je roeping was om gehoorzaam te zijn en tegen de rots te duwen en je geloof te bewaren en te vertrouwen op mijn wijsheid en dat heb je gedaan nu zal ik mijn vriend de rots verplaatsen

7848258 its a very busy time and im looking to bring in another two maybe three players
7848259 its not easy there are so many players at your disposal that its hard to get the right one i dont want to just throw money away
7848260 when youre in the premiership you do get linked to so many players but at the end of the day we will see what happens this week
7848261 im obviously pleased with the result i thought l played a good solid match and am just pleased to be through to the next round
7848262 shes not to be underestimated even though im ranked higher than her shes a tricky opponent but i thought i handled her well
7848263 i wish i had a stronger squad to take down there and i wish i could just rest one or two players who need it
7848264 but i wont be able to do that i have just got to pick the very best team i can we havent got those riches yet because of injuries

7848270 did we find it absolutely not we did not find that listeria
7848271 did we let people down yes but we were doing the right things
7848272 we would occasionally find a listeria positive swab at which case we sanitize that complete area and swab again
7848273 every order is finalised two weeks in advance so we set the pricing we ship it and then once the goods arrive we look at the pricing again and issue a credit note based on how the price has changed
7848274 that is something which we are very happy about and it has been great so far the first two orders that we shipped to ibs have been distributed very well among the big retailers
7848275 for the fourth quarter with ibs we are targeting around 6 000 pieces of hard drives going into retail
7848276 if you talk about 6 000 hard drives and consider that simpletech doesnt have more than 5 market share in egypt you get an idea of how big the market really is it is a huge market and we definitely want to get a share of it

7848284 in 2004 a report from the catholic league for religious and civil rights revealed that teachers are more likely than priests to sexually abuse minors the report said that previous studies from the early 1980s to 1991 showed that one in four girls and one in six boys is sexually abused by a teacher by age 18 another revealed that 17 7 per cent of males who graduated from high school and 82 2 per cent of females reported sexual harassment by faculty or staff during their years in school

7848761 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7848762 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7848763 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again

7848777 youve been with this team during some its highs how does this team compare to that era
7848778 lavoro qui da qualche mese prendo 8 dollari lordi lora 6 25 netti per 44 ore settimanali fanno 1100 dollari al mese circa 700 euro come per tutti i contratti americani posso essere licenziata senza preavviso e giusta causa se sto male ho diritto a soli due sick day giorni pagati e ho dieci giorni di ferie allanno per questo rimpiango i tempi in cui lavoravo in nero in una libreria di torino per 900 euro al mese
7848779 al colloquio non sapevo quasi una parola dinglese se non quelle imparate al diner e ad un corso gratuito in biblioteca mi limitavo ad annuire avevo capito che cercavano in fretta una persona per gli ordini dei libri italiani in italiano perch la ragazza che se ne occupava si era licenziata ho firmato il contratto e ho iniziato il giorno dopo
7848780 ma tanto qui sopra salgono prevalentemente italiani che vanno orgogliosi della libreria come se fosse loro e non comprano nulla
7848781 comunque fra qualche anno torner in europa per tanti motivi ad esempio partorire qua costa 35 000 dollari se hai unassicurazione privata risparmi il 90 ma lassicurazione cara e comunque devi sborsare 3 500 dollari
7848782 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7848783 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7848784 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7848785 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you

7848791 nice is beginning to flex its muscles there will be regulation on prices nice will be involved in it and prices will go down
7848792 theyre the people who are probably best placed to say how much the drugs should cost
7848793 if nice gets involved in pricing as soon a drug is launched then at least the company will be able to start selling the product straight away if a price is agreed
7848794 nices role critical for the nhs is to value medicines

7848801 our research has shown that its not just the big purchases that are hitting the carlisle workers wallets its also the seemingly harmless little purchases that have become a part of everyday life
7848802 there are so many convenient breakfast and lunch options in carlisle city centre now that workers are constantly eating out without realising the expense
7848803 for example simply choosing to have breakfast before you leave the house in the morning as opposed to on the go could save you more than 800 a year
7848804 i thought the fact that changes had been made to the fire station and the homes on warwick street had been modernised would have an effect
7848805 i made the application on behalf of carlisle and the people living in those homes and i dont regret doing it
7848806 i dont want to see buildings in carlisle lost if it is deemed that they have merit that could be architectural historical or social
7848807 weve seen an increase in fuel and water rate debts linked to the increases in the cost of living people on income support are finding it harder and harder to make their benefit stretch
7848808 fuel debts used to be rare but its now a regular occurrence and its not just people who are on benefits its also people who are working
7848809 some people are missing meals to save money especially pensioners
7848810 they regard it as important to pay their bills and to make sure theyve got the money some are only having one meal a day theyre literally going hungry
7848811 i recently referred one man to age concern because i was so concerned about the lack of food he was eating
7848812 i though it was leaving him not able to manage we estimate we see only a fraction of the people who are struggling because pensioners tend not to ask for help
7848813 housekeeping food and clothing is the one bit of your budget you can control so if youre on a low income thats what gets hammered
7848814 people are obviously thinking that winters coming and we had a bad winter last year theres concern about whats coming
7848815 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action to ease the pressure on millions of households
7848816 as an emergency measure to help alleviate the problem this winter the government and energy companies should be working together to offer fuel vouchers to the poorest pensioners
7848817 in order to stand a real chance of helping the poorest pensioners the government must make it mandatory for energy companies to offer social tariffs at the cheapest rates
7848818 i was honored to deliver the closing prayer at the dnc on monday night evangelical voices have been scarce within this party perhaps since the carter administration but as strides are being made on key issues of sanctity of life and social justice as well as peaceful solutions to world conflicts more and more evangelicals are taking a closer look at options certain members of the democratic party are beginning to deliver there is a long way to go but sending a message to washington that no single party has the christian community in their pocket thus causing each party to carefully consider the issues most important to us is in my opinion a positive evolution i am glad that for the most part the dialogue has been constructive and positive will you join me in keeping the conversation thoughtful and not reactionary that said i was honored to speak to and especially pray with and for the dnc
7848819 you should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you anointing you with oil in the name of the lord such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick and the lord will make you well and if you have committed any sins you will be forgiven confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed my dear brothers and sisters if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins
7848820 so i say let the holy spirit guide your lives then you wont be doing what your sinful nature craves the sinful nature wants to do evil which is just the opposite of what the spirit wants and the spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires
7848821 why cant i get rid of these thoughts why do they keep coming into my mind why is it that it seems that i almost at times desire them to come in part of me wants to say go away and another part of me says no stay why
7848822 temptation comes from our own desires which entice us and drag us away these desires give birth to sinful actions and when sin is allowed to grow it gives birth to death
7848823 so i say let the holy spirit guide your lives then you wont be doing what your sinful nature craves the spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires

7848839 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it

7848841 the closing of this round by these prestigious investors during a tight financial credit climate sends a strong and positive message about their confidence in the growth potential of mobile search and advertising and our ability to execute on our long term vision
7848842 it does seem carriers once feared the search engines eating their lunch and now theyre doing deals with them
7848843 their future exists more as an ad network than a search engine
7848844 jumptap has successfully positioned itself as the hub of the mobile advertising ecosystem and demonstrated its ability to attain its goals
7848845 apple broke that barrier between the service carriers and technology companies
7848846 the entire mobile industry saw the benefits of letting a tech company come in and do what they do best which is the hardware and software and now weve seen this domino effect with iphone driven query volume picking up for google and iphone based traffic surges to other sites so at amp ts competitors see that they need to partner to take advantage of increased data consumption as well as mobile search advertising
7848847 to say the verizon wireless default search experience is messy is an understatement
7848848 im a verizon wireless customer and i get bounced all over the place depending on whatever deal the carrier cut
7848849 apple created a catalyst with the iphone and now theres no going back
7848850 companies like verizon are almost forced to find partnerships for competitive reasons theyd probably rather go back to the way it used to be where they had all the control but new standards have been set in the marketplace
7848851 the u s carriers that open up faster and give consumers ways to personalize their devices and gain access to the types of content they want will win those that resist will not
7848852 over time we will make more money from mobile advertising
7848853 the reason is because the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone everywhere it knows all about you
7848854 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7848855 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7848856 consumers really need this information to make choices when hiring a busing company to transport their children
7848857 my adorer americans it is in like manner awe inspiring to have being here and not at all nought is thriving to keep me away from this appropriate gathering tonight
7848858 i pledge to you that i behest have being in that place nearest january without ceasing the pose of the united states senate
7848859 were both so feverish i moderation this is definitely the happiest moment in my life
7848860 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7848861 instead they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7848862 the utter illogic of the governments position reveals what is really going on
7848863 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove the indictment alleges no quid pro quo for any gifts sen stevens allegedly received but the government now asks permission to introduce evidence of official actions in order to invite the jury baselessly to infer just such a quid pro quo
7848864 the negative consequences flowing from such disclosure particularly during a time frame when the defendant had been engaged in performing official acts for veco and bill allen
7848865 would have subjected himself to public scrutiny and criticism regarding his ongoing relationship with veco and bill allen and the fact that he was laboring under a conflict of interest
7848866 most importantly disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7848867 cannot credibly claim that he cannot understand the charges or prepare his defense
7848868 where the indictment charges that stevens received things of value at the girdwood residence the indictment specifically notes that the renovation work included jacking up and resting the house on stilts building a new first floor with two bedrooms and a bathroom renovating the existing residence and adding a garage with workshop and a second story wraparound deck
7848869 each and every detail of how the case will be proved
7848870 the prosecutors who were involved in the grand jury proceedings are not aware of any evidence introduced to the grand jury that reflects an act taken by stevens such as bills or statements on the floor of the senate that would be considered protected legislative activity
7848871 it involves enforcement of an unambiguous rule contained in the criminal law do not lie when required by law to provide honest disclosure of assets
7848872 is a misguided attempt to impugn sen stevens and his family before the jury
7848873 if they know you have legal advice they will be more careful

7848877 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy
7848878 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7848879 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7848880 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis
7848881 i think the direction of the club is always paramount
7848882 the club is bigger than any individual but having said that it was a very tough decision for the club to move forward we needed to make that decision
7848883 if i take my playing cap off and look at it from an outside perspective we all want the club to succeed and move forward to playing finals footy and i totally understand my delisting
7848884 but from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7848885 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7848886 jimmy stynes came to me to say that you need two more games for life membership
7848887 to play last week and obviously to get up this week to be a life member of the afl is something i can really be proud of

7848896 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

7848952 he somehow got it from the isa you will never be your old self again
7848953 i say it with him want to be there for you now just like you tried to say it with him be there for me before come back with me until we apprehend stefano
7848954 you go home but i go with you and stay with you as your police guard just like when we met weve gone full circle
7848955 you what no he could not have escaped find him
7848956 i know you love him and i know how much you want him back i also know how much it would mean for us
7848957 its already out there she knows you and i slept together
7848958 einige kunden haben angek ndigt dass sie bei niedrigeren geb hren ihren orderflow auf xetra steigern werden
7848959 zum einen ist das eindeutig eine reaktion auf steigenden wettbewerbsdruck und damit generell schon einmal keine gute nachricht
7848960 und dann dr ckt das nat rlich ganz klar auf die marge
7848961 the barack obama campaign started late to try to reach out to latinos
7848962 they basically gave up the latino vote in the primaries to hillary clinton and theres a struggle now
7848963 polls show that latinos are thinking of voting for obama theyre obviously thinking about voting democratic
7848964 after a couple of electoral seasons when a specific number of latinos went to the republican party up to 40 per cent of latinos voted for george bush in 2004 they are going back to the democratic party because they dont like the way things are going in the country they dont like the immigration rhetoric they dont like the economy they dont like the war
7848965 the level of support that obama has among latinos is still not high enough
7848966 think obama is too young he doesnt understand the us chinese relationship and he really doesnt understand chinas issues
7848967 there really is a reason why during the primaries the super delegates and many influential black people lined up behind hillary
7848968 there was something so different about obama that people needed to be convinced that he was united with the black community in america
7848969 the truth is this is a different guy and hes different in many ways because hes not like african americans are and people know that
7848970 some latinos think that hes an immigrant but they confuse him with his father
7848971 and thats good because that makes him understand the immigrant experience
7848972 mccains been around hes pushed immigration reform its really an advantage that he has
7848973 ser un t nel ferroviario de 23 kil metros y ser una de las obras de ferrocarril m s importantes del mundo de una magnitud similar al t nel que cruza el canal de la mancha y que vincula francia con inglaterra
7848974 es una obra enorme y vamos a pasar de las actuales 2 5 millones de toneladas por a o de paso por la frontera a 40 millones por a o
7848975 esto es muy importante sobre todo para la provincia de buenos aires que exporta mucho volumen
7848976 el paso pehuenche a la altura de malarg e se est pavimentando a toda velocidad y la presidenta pretende inaugurarlo en marzo de 2010 ese paso es usado mucho por la provincia porque conecta la ruta 88 desde san nicol s y tambi n empalma con la ruta 5

7848979 de integriteit van een journalist in twijfel wordt getrokken door hem een lobbyist te noemen
7848980 het verwijderen van reacties van critici leidt tot een niet representatief beeld van de reacties

7848982 zoals het de redactie vrij staat een ingezonden brief niet te plaatsen in haar papieren krant kan zij tevens een op de website verschenen lezersreactie verwijderen
7848983 van de redactie kan immers niet worden verwacht dat zij alle reacties vooraf controleert
7848984 what was that and why havent you forwarded it to me yet
7848985 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7848986 it is a unique object and preserved in an ideal state
7848987 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
7848988 what makes obamas task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly racial prejudice
7848989 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7848990 to the rest of the world a rejection of the promise he represents wouldnt just be an odd choice by the united states it would be taken for what it would be sign and symptom of a nations historical decline

7849001 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and program of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and program regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution

7849010 but with yaradua many things are going to change under his watch while we want foreign investment and would respect the sanctity of legally binding contracts he will not allow a situation in which our country continues to be short changed
7849011 to my utter dismay certain authorities in nigeria have chosen to ignore our contract sending in heavies a few months ago to smash up our lounge with sledgehammers
7849012 the behaviour of the authorities was similar to the way the mafioso behaved in the u s in the 1930s if virgin nigeria can be treated in this way can any company in the world seriously consider investing in nigeria in the future
7849013 based on the public spat in nigeria virgin pulling out of an investment would be construed as having an image effect that is far more negative than necessary
7849014 very concerned about the future implications for investor confidence in nigeria

7849026 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7849027 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request

7849040 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7849041 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7849042 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

7849045 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7849046 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7849047 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7849048 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7849049 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7849050 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7849051 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7849052 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7849053 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7849054 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7849101 these data are exciting because they demonstrate that recombinant vlps are a valid and potent vaccine approach against influenza combined with our innovative manufacturing approach our vlp vaccine candidate has the potential to address an unmet need in pandemic influenza preparedness efforts being planned by health authorities around the world
7849102 this data milestone marks good progress in the viability of novavaxs vaccine which combined with ge healthcares ready to use bioprocessing technologies signals the promise of a solution to problems countries face in preparing for the inevitability of pandemic influenza
7849103 in the face of a global health threat innovations are required that can deliver safe and effective vaccines quickly and reliably

7849106 customers who used two men and a truck graebel van lines or north american van lines all report very high levels of satisfaction with their moving company
7849107 however it is two men and a trucks consistently strong performance across all aspects of the move that primarily contribute to their top ranking graebel van lines and north american van lines also represent solid options for customers looking for a positive moving experience
7849108 although consumers view moving services as a commodity there are real differences in both satisfaction and performance levels among the companies included in the study
7849109 the challenge is to help consumers understand these differences to aid in their ability to make an informed decision customers should be aware that in the end finding the best value can be different from finding the lowest price
7849110 since there is a high likelihood of incurring damage or loss of belongings during a move it is critical for consumers to make informed decisions when selecting a moving company entrusted to handle their most prized possessions
7849111 however when loss or damage does occur moving companies seem to do a good job of providing fair compensation to their customers

7849174 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7849175 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7849176 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7849177 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7849178 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7849179 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7849180 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7849181 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7849182 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7849183 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7849184 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7849185 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7849186 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7849187 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7849188 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7849189 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7849190 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7849191 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7849192 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7849193 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7849194 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7849195 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7849196 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7849197 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7849198 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7849199 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7849200 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7849201 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7849202 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7849203 this is a planning took where all things are going

7849306 there is a good deal of other recently published data that shows that on key indicators the social class gap has reduced slightly since 2004 taken as a whole goves document shows extreme carelessness or disregard for truth and accuracy he is right that inequalities are too high but we need a proper debate about this and what to do about it if he wants to be taken seriously he should withdraw this document and re enter the debate when he has a better grasp of the evidence

7849342 we the hindus and sikhs are living as brothers and sisters we are having very cordial relations we cooperate with each other in agriculture and other daily transactions
7849343 our government is very helpful to us and it is doing a lot for our welfare like paying us the right value for our agricultural products
7849344 there is no danger to our farming we are ready to face any challenge government is always ready to help us in any problem the government is like our family we can always approach it and be sure that the response will be positive
7849345 these statements are far from the truth in fact agriculture in punjab has grown manifold the government has been helpful and the farmers enterprising every year the agricultural output is increasing of late we have been diversifying agriculture growing vegetables and other crops
7849346 today the agricultural production has doubled up in comparison to what it was 15 years ago today the farmers are using modern techniques fifteen years ago the production in agriculture was just four to eight quintals per acre today it is 30 to 35 quintals per acre punjab is golden bird in terms of agriculture

7849350 i find madonnas attempt to compare john mccain with hitler beyond the pale and an insult to all americans democrats as well as republicans
7849351 there ought to be no place in the political and social discourse of american culture for such deliberate distortions and lies sure to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of young people around the world
7849352 comparisons to hitler have no place in a music concert or in the presidential campaign
7849353 whatever madonnas political or personal views it is outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy or to make a comment on american political leadership
7849354 doing so trivializes the history of the holocaust and is an insult to the memories of the victims and their families

7849360 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7849361 the bonds have ben set low enough so that we believe that most people will bond out in a relatively short time

7849365 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7849366 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7849367 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7849368 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7849369 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7849370 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7849371 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7849372 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7849373 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7849374 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7849375 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7849376 im amazed at how much attention is being given to one solitary person when i have found nobody who has expressed similar sentiments post primary
7849377 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7849378 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7849379 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7849380 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7849381 republicans say that john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7849382 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7849383 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7849384 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7849385 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7849386 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention

7849398 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7849399 the addition of this hotel to our portfolio is an excellent illustration of our continued focus on international expansion and our ability to build on the solid platform we established more than a decade ago
7849400 interstate was one of the first independent management companies to operate in moscow and after 13 years has developed strong local and regional relationships and contacts we also have strong ties to all the major hotel franchisors and are delighted to have successfully negotiated the hilton affiliation and to be managing the first hilton hotel in russia we have a very strong pipeline of additional management contract opportunities in russia greater europe india mexico and central america
7849401 moscow is one of the fastest growing cities and strongest economies in the world today and this is one of the most recognized hotels in the city one of seven famous stalin towers that visually define the moscow skyline
7849402 the restoration has successfully blended the propertys rich architectural heritage and todays latest technology and amenities with its highly desirable location just off komsomolskaya square and the power of the hilton name we expect moscows first hilton brand hotel to become a magnet for international business and leisure travelers
7849403 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7849404 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7849405 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7849406 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their co operation and ask that they remain patient we will ensure people are kept updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
7849407 i thought the police would be finished by now but its gone on another week
7849408 i thought they would have arrested the man at the same time
7849409 the dogs just emerged from behind the farmers house we knew straight away that they werent with anyone at the farm because of the state they were in
7849410 it was terrible they were so bad they had no hair and there was blood coming from all over them
7849411 while we were waiting for someone to come we tied the dogs up as we simply couldnt have them running about no one knew what sort of infections they may have
7849412 they were really friendly its sad ive never seen anything like it in my life
7849413 i imagine this would have cost somebody quite a lot of money to treat and thats why the dogs were dumped its highly unlikely they ran away from their owners and ended up on the farm
7849414 the dogs will have been suffering from this skin condition for months though and they will have been in great pain it will also have driven them nuts imagine having things crawling all over you for so long the vet told me it was the worst case he had ever seen
7849415 they are very canny dogs and are certainly not aggressive unfortunately such dogs often have a fighting future as their destiny but there is no evidence of that with this pair
7849416 they dont have scars and they still have their ears which is a very good start
7849417 this success is tribute to the hard work of our staff in emergency treatment departments across lothian
7849418 cutting waiting times is a clear priority for this scottish government to ensure patients get the treatment they need as quickly as possible it is also important that they have a clear understanding of when they can expect to receive their treatment and our new ways of publishing waiting time statistics does just that
7849419 the unprecedented levels of transparency offered by the new system means patients are no longer at risk of finding themselves banished to a hidden waiting list
7849420 todays statistics released by isd scotland show an overall impressive performance from the nhs in scotland effectively meeting all our challenging national maximum waiting times targets
7849421 this is very good news for patients but it is not the end of the story
7849422 sexual health services need to be accessible and available at short notice long waits for help could be hazardous where sexually transmitted infections are involved and it is good to see that our service has done well in this test

7849499 members of the agency are clearly on heightened alert based upon the security thats involved with a convention the size of the one that is occurring in denver behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
7849500 i cannot talk about the federal implications associated with this case

7849767 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7849768 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7849769 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7849770 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7849771 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7849772 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7849773 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7849774 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7849775 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7849776 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction

7849783 we did a great amount of due diligence before we chose highwinds as our cdn partner we were impressed with highwinds for their technology and massive infrastructure and equally so for their competence and longevity as a business
7849784 highwinds has done a great job of acquiring good talent and their teams have an obvious passion for what they do both from a technology perspective and a company wide commitment to customer service our customers videos stream better faster and more reliably now highwinds has been quick to accommodate our requests and the next to real time establishing of accounts is unprecedented in the industry
7849785 we can set up a new customer account within 30 seconds which enables us to increase our sales cycle velocity by closing business faster
7849786 and while their technology rivals that of any other cdn granting resellers complete control over customer accounts pricing and billing and the ability to re brand the best cdn interface ive ever seen is what sets highwinds apart from its competitors we are private labeling the cdn and striketracker as i5labs cdn by highwinds and customers are responding well to it in the end though business comes down to people and i trust highwinds as a business partner
7849787 our clients often come to us somewhat intimidated by video so we always start with a strategy and uncover ways to meet strategic goals and solve business problems we often use video in innovative ways whether it be as part of a social media marketing campaign a content driven web application or a corporate web site
7849788 because we present ourselves as a one stop solution provider having a good cdn partner is really important to us we want to make the entire process as easy as possible for our clients and we want video and content delivery to be affordable for them with highwinds we get complete control of what appears to be a commodity and were even using highwinds as a catalyst to pitch new business
7849789 we can get a client up and running on the cdn with very little risk and no long term commitment which really lowers the barrier to entry for all types of companies and allows them to deliver their content fast and reliably
7849790 we work with a lot of funded startup companies who want to differentiate themselves by using bleeding edge technologies to get in front of their audience in fun usable and creative ways
7849791 we needed a cdn partner who could deliver client content quickly reliably and affordably while taking a load off our servers utilizing the highwinds api has also allowed us to integrate highwinds into our software and has been critical in streamlining backend and admin processes the ability for us to command and control every aspect of account management content management and streaming schedules and to be able to do all this with highwinds serving content in an invisible capacity is the ultimate benefit of being a highwinds partner
7849792 the common thread were seeing in the rich media design industry and the critical advantage were delivering to these companies is the ability for them to call the shots when it comes to their own customers
7849793 were pleased to be cultivating this niche and arming these firms with tools that position them for success the resounding enthusiasm heard by 9mmedia i5labs one pica virtupoint and others about our technology and the glowing remarks about our talented and dedicated team are a true testament to our ability to excel at servicing this market

7849818 weve had a very successful relationship with gsi for the past seven years evidenced by the significant growth of our e commerce business this new deal gives us even more flexibility greater control and ultimately enables us to better serve our customers while accelerating our multichannel strategy
7849819 we are excited to take our partnership with dicks sporting goods to the next level
7849820 this new agreement will better position us to maximize value for both companies we believe dicks sporting goods has tremendous multichannel potential given their position as one of the largest and fasting growing retailers in the united states and the preeminent player in sporting goods retail
7849821 as we conducted a thorough evaluation of potential options for how to better serve our customers we determined that continuing to work with gsi was the best alternative for us
7849822 we believe that gsi offers the best solution that complements our long term strategic plan and that they are the right e commerce provider to help us grow our multichannel business another 10 times over the next decade
7849823 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7849824 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7849825 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7849826 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7849827 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7849828 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7849829 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7849830 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7849831 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7849832 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7849833 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7849834 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7849835 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7849836 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7849837 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7849838 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7849839 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7849840 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7849841 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7849842 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7849843 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7849844 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7849845 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7849846 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7849847 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7849848 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7849849 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7849850 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7849851 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7849852 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7849853 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7849854 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7849855 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7849856 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7849857 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7849858 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7849859 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7849860 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7849861 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7849862 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7849863 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7849864 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7849865 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7849866 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7849867 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7849868 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7849869 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7849870 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7849871 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7849872 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7849873 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7849874 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7849875 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7849876 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7849877 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7849878 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7849879 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7849880 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7849881 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7849882 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7849883 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7849884 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7849885 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7849886 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7849887 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7849888 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7849889 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7849890 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7849891 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7849892 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7849893 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7849894 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7849895 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7849896 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7849897 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7849898 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7849899 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7849900 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7849901 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7849902 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7849903 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7849904 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7849905 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7849906 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7849907 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7849908 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7849909 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7849910 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7849911 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7849912 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7849913 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7849914 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7849915 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7849916 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7849917 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7849918 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7849919 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7849920 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7849921 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7849922 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7849923 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7849924 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7849925 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7849926 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7849927 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7849928 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7849929 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7849930 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7849931 atirar em obama de uma posi o estrat gica com um rifle a uma dist ncia de 750 metros
7849932 foi acompanhada pela m e nadja e fez o estilo
7849933 as mulheres t m se superado mostrado que s o capazes de brigar de batalhar de sofrer e de fazer igual aos homens e conquistar os seus objetivos
7849934 no ltimo dia a id ia era realmente ganhar a medalha de bronze porque a gente sabia que estava dif cil lutar pelo ouro e pela prata pela pontua o mas a gente acreditou tanto e fez uma regata t o boa que acabou dando a prata foi uma prata com gostinho de ouro
7849935 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7849936 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7849937 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7849938 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7849939 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7849940 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7849941 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7849942 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7849943 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7849944 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7849945 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7849946 um dia hist rico para nosso povo estou agradecido s autoridades e ao povo da r ssia pelo grande passo que deram hoje ao reconhecer a independ ncia da abkh zia

7849948 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7849949 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance

7849957 the flu vaccination challenge highlights for health care workers the value that flu vaccinations can have on patient safety doctors nurses technical and administrative staff may care for patients with compromised immune systems including the elderly and people living with a chronic disease as a professional devoted to do no harm flu vaccination gives me an opportunity to help protect my patients by decreasing the chances that i will get the flu and pass it along to my patients

7849966 when you have a healthy middle class it really does change the dynamic of schools and housing
7849967 i recognize there is still a huge achievement gap but i dont want to lose the idea that our kids are gaining
7849968 some are gaining at a faster rate that is what is widening our gap
7849969 it gives me hope when we find out there are some places in spite of difficult situations that are doing well
